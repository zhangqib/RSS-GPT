<div> scale development, language models, dependency, questionnaire, validation
Summary:<br />
The article presents the development and validation of a new questionnaire, LLM-D12, to measure dependency on large language models (LLMs). The questionnaire consists of 12 items organized into two factors: Instrumental Dependency and Relationship Dependency. Instrumental Dependency assesses reliance on LLMs for decision-making and cognitive tasks, while Relationship Dependency captures perceptions of LLMs as socially meaningful entities. The scale demonstrated excellent internal consistency and discriminant validity. The study highlights the nuanced nature of dependency on LLMs, suggesting that such dependency may not indicate dysfunction but could become problematic in certain contexts. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the LLM-human relationship and provide a valuable tool for assessing dependency on LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: There is growing interest in understanding how people interact with large language models (LLMs) and whether such models elicit dependency or even addictive behaviour. Validated tools to assess the extent to which individuals may become dependent on LLMs are scarce and primarily build on classic behavioral addiction symptoms, adapted to the context of LLM use. We view this as a conceptual limitation, as the LLM-human relationship is more nuanced and warrants a fresh and distinct perspective. To address this gap, we developed and validated a new 12-item questionnaire to measure LLM dependency, referred to as LLM-D12. The scale was based on the authors' prior theoretical work, with items developed accordingly and responses collected from 526 participants in the UK. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, performed on separate halves of the total sample using a split-sample approach, supported a two-factor structure: Instrumental Dependency (six items) and Relationship Dependency (six items). Instrumental Dependency reflects the extent to which individuals rely on LLMs to support or collaborate in decision-making and cognitive tasks. Relationship Dependency captures the tendency to perceive LLMs as socially meaningful, sentient, or companion-like entities. The two-factor structure demonstrated excellent internal consistency and clear discriminant validity. External validation confirmed both the conceptual foundation and the distinction between the two subscales. The psychometric properties and structure of our LLM-D12 scale were interpreted in light of the emerging view that dependency on LLMs does not necessarily indicate dysfunction but may still reflect reliance levels that could become problematic in certain contexts.

<div> Keyword: Vision-Language-Action, robotic system, Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization, failure correction, adaptation

Summary:
The article introduces a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization (HAPO) method to enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for reliable robotic deployment. The HAPO method involves human intervention to correct failures and collect interaction trajectories. These trajectories are used in action preference optimization to improve VLA models' adaptability and failure mitigation. An adaptive reweighting algorithm addresses issues related to introducing preference optimization into VLA models. The method enables VLA models to learn from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Experimental results in simulation and real-world scenarios demonstrate the framework's superior generalization and robustness in various manipulation tasks. By combining human intervention with action preference optimization, the HAPO method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models.

Abstract: Establishing a reliable and iteratively refined robotic system is essential for deploying real-world applications. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their dependence on expert demonstrations hinders the crucial capabilities of correction and learning from failures. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a Human-assisted Action Preference Optimization method named HAPO, designed to correct deployment failures and foster effective adaptation through preference alignment for VLA models. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. These human-intervention trajectories are further employed within the action preference optimization process, facilitating VLA models to mitigate failure action occurrences while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Specifically, we propose an adaptive reweighting algorithm to address the issues of irreversible interactions and token probability mismatch when introducing preference optimization into VLA models, facilitating model learning from binary desirability signals derived from interactions. Through combining these modules, our human-assisted action preference optimization method ensures reliable deployment and effective learning from failure for VLA models. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.

<div> reinforcement learning, video large language models, GRPO, Reg-GRPO, difficulty-aware data augmentation <br />
Summary: <br />
In this paper, the authors investigate the application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) and address two key challenges: reliance on safeguards and the vanishing advantage problem. They propose a new approach called Regressive GRPO (Reg-GRPO) for training video LLMs, which reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task to directly predict the advantage. By eliminating the need for safeguards, such as clipping and min functions, Reg-GRPO provides more direct policy guidance. Additionally, a difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy is introduced to enhance training samples at solvable difficulty levels, improving the diversity and informativeness of reward signals. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DeepVideo-R1 model outperforms existing methods in video reasoning tasks, showcasing significant enhancements in video reasoning performance across various benchmarks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In particular, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown impressive success by employing a PPO-style reinforcement algorithm with group-based normalized rewards. However, the application of GRPO to Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) has been less studied. In this paper, we explore GRPO for video LLMs and identify two primary issues that impede its effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) the vanishing advantage problem. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with our proposed Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO objective as a regression task, directly predicting the advantage in GRPO. This design eliminates the need for safeguards like clipping and min functions, thereby facilitating more direct policy guidance by aligning the model with the advantage values. We also design the difficulty-aware data augmentation strategy that dynamically augments training samples at solvable difficulty levels, fostering diverse and informative reward signals. Our comprehensive experiments show that DeepVideo-R1 significantly improves video reasoning performance across multiple video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities in chemistry tasks while still facing challenges due to outdated pretraining knowledge and the difficulty of incorporating specialized chemical expertise. To address these issues, we propose an LLM-based agent that synergistically integrates 137 external chemical tools created ranging from basic information retrieval to complex reaction predictions, and a dataset curation pipeline to generate the dataset ChemToolBench that facilitates both effective tool selection and precise parameter filling during fine-tuning and evaluation. We introduce a Hierarchical Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (HE-MCTS) framework, enabling independent optimization of tool planning and execution. By leveraging self-generated data, our approach supports step-level fine-tuning (FT) of the policy model and training task-adaptive PRM and ORM that surpass GPT-4o. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach significantly improves performance in Chemistry QA and discovery tasks, offering a robust solution to integrate specialized tools with LLMs for advanced chemical applications.

<div> trade-off, provable correctness, data-mapping capacity, Artificial Intelligence, conjecture  
Summary:  
This article introduces a conjecture that formalizes a trade-off between provable correctness and data-mapping capacity in AI systems. It suggests that systems aiming for deductive guarantees have a narrow operational domain, while those handling high-dimensional data sacrifice error-free performance. By making this trade-off explicit, the conjecture challenges engineering goals and philosophical expectations in AI. It presents the conjecture in an information-theoretic form and relates it to debates in epistemology and technology philosophy. The analysis discusses implications such as underdetermination and moral responsibility, highlighting the need for new evaluation standards and governance in AI design. Overall, the conjecture could reshape how AI systems are evaluated and governed, emphasizing the importance of verifying the inequality for trustworthy AI in the future. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a conjecture that formalises a fundamental trade-off between provable correctness and broad data-mapping capacity in Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. When an AI system is engineered for deductively watertight guarantees (demonstrable certainty about the error-free nature of its outputs) -- as in classical symbolic AI -- its operational domain must be narrowly circumscribed and pre-structured. Conversely, a system that can input high-dimensional data to produce rich information outputs -- as in contemporary generative models -- necessarily relinquishes the possibility of zero-error performance, incurring an irreducible risk of errors or misclassification. By making this previously implicit trade-off explicit and open to rigorous verification, the conjecture significantly reframes both engineering ambitions and philosophical expectations for AI. After reviewing the historical motivations for this tension, the article states the conjecture in information-theoretic form and contextualises it within broader debates in epistemology, formal verification, and the philosophy of technology. It then offers an analysis of its implications and consequences, drawing on notions of underdetermination, prudent epistemic risk, and moral responsibility. The discussion clarifies how, if correct, the conjecture would help reshape evaluation standards, governance frameworks, and hybrid system design. The conclusion underscores the importance of eventually proving or refuting the inequality for the future of trustworthy AI.

<div> Keywords: medical AI, context-switching, clinical notes, decision-making, healthcare access

Summary:
This perspective discusses the limitations of current medical foundation models in adapting to new populations, specialties, or settings without retraining. It highlights the challenge of contextual errors, where models fail to consider critical patient-specific information due to their inability to dynamically adjust their reasoning across evolving clinical situations. The authors propose a vision for context-switching AI in healthcare, envisioning models that can dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties, populations, workflows, and clinical roles. This innovation aims to enhance the ability of AI models to diagnose, manage, and treat a variety of diseases across different medical specialties and regions. Ultimately, the goal is to improve access to medical care by developing AI systems that can effectively interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to diverse clinical contexts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Medical foundation models, including language models trained on clinical notes, vision-language models on medical images, and multimodal models on electronic health records, can summarize clinical notes, answer medical questions, and assist in decision-making. Adapting these models to new populations, specialties, or settings typically requires fine-tuning, careful prompting, or retrieval from knowledge bases. This can be impractical, and limits their ability to interpret unfamiliar inputs and adjust to clinical situations not represented during training. As a result, models are prone to contextual errors, where predictions appear reasonable but fail to account for critical patient-specific or contextual information. These errors stem from a fundamental limitation that current models struggle with: dynamically adjusting their behavior across evolving contexts of medical care. In this Perspective, we outline a vision for context-switching in medical AI: models that dynamically adapt their reasoning without retraining to new specialties, populations, workflows, and clinical roles. We envision context-switching AI to diagnose, manage, and treat a wide range of diseases across specialties and regions, and expand access to medical care.

Summary:
This study explores the relationship between causation and correlation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. By utilizing the XGBoost algorithm, the researchers identified key features influencing AD classification, such as cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of interrelated variables, while SHAP values provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages. The results emphasize the importance of distinguishing between causation and correlation in AD research, highlighting that strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation. Integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis lays the groundwork for future causal inference studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach can lead to improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding the distinction between causation and correlation is critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, as it impacts diagnosis, treatment, and the identification of true disease drivers. This experiment investigates the relationships among clinical, cognitive, genetic, and biomarker features using a combination of correlation analysis, machine learning classification, and model interpretability techniques. Employing the XGBoost algorithm, we identified key features influencing AD classification, including cognitive scores and genetic risk factors. Correlation matrices revealed clusters of interrelated variables, while SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provided detailed insights into feature contributions across disease stages. Our results highlight that strong correlations do not necessarily imply causation, emphasizing the need for careful interpretation of associative data. By integrating feature importance and interpretability with classical statistical analysis, this work lays groundwork for future causal inference studies aimed at uncovering true pathological mechanisms. Ultimately, distinguishing causal factors from correlated markers can lead to improved early diagnosis and targeted interventions for Alzheimer's disease.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, safety, fairness, transparency, accountability

Summary:
In the study of artificial intelligence (AI), the focus is on ensuring responsible and trustworthy AI systems that are safe, fair, transparent, and accountable. The research extends safety techniques to ensure resilience against delayed observations, particularly in the context of autonomous vehicles, to prevent collisions with road users. Fairness shields are introduced to enforce group fairness in decision-making processes over finite time horizons, balancing fairness with minimal interference. A formal framework for assessing intentional behavior in decision-making agents is proposed, providing quantitative metrics for agency and intention quotient. This allows for retrospective analysis of intention to determine responsibility in case of unintended harm caused by autonomous systems. The research is unified under the "reactive decision-making" framework, providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches for the development of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ensuring responsible use of artificial intelligence (AI) has become imperative as autonomous systems increasingly influence critical societal domains. However, the concept of trustworthy AI remains broad and multi-faceted. This thesis advances knowledge in the safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability of AI systems. In safety, we extend classical deterministic shielding techniques to become resilient against delayed observations, enabling practical deployment in real-world conditions. We also implement both deterministic and probabilistic safety shields into simulated autonomous vehicles to prevent collisions with road users, validating the use of these techniques in realistic driving simulators. We introduce fairness shields, a novel post-processing approach to enforce group fairness in sequential decision-making settings over finite and periodic time horizons. By optimizing intervention costs while strictly ensuring fairness constraints, this method efficiently balances fairness with minimal interference. For transparency and accountability, we propose a formal framework for assessing intentional behaviour in probabilistic decision-making agents, introducing quantitative metrics of agency and intention quotient. We use these metrics to propose a retrospective analysis of intention, useful for determining responsibility when autonomous systems cause unintended harm. Finally, we unify these contributions through the ``reactive decision-making'' framework, providing a general formalization that consolidates previous approaches. Collectively, the advancements presented contribute practically to the realization of safer, fairer, and more accountable AI systems, laying the foundations for future research in trustworthy AI.

<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a new benchmark, WGSR-Bench, to assess Large Language Models’ (LLMs) strategic reasoning abilities in wargame scenarios. While LLMs have shown proficiency in mathematical and symbolic reasoning, strategic reasoning – essential in dynamic environments – has not been thoroughly evaluated. WGSR-Bench focuses on three core tasks: Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling, and Policy generation, encapsulating the S-POE architecture. These tasks aim to assess LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning. By designing test samples around wargame scenarios, which involve uncertainty, adversarial dynamics, and strategic choices, the benchmark evaluates LLMs’ strategic reasoning skills comprehensively. The ultimate goal is to understand the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in strategic reasoning and advance research in large model-driven strategic intelligence. <div>
arXiv:2506.10264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to a qualitative leap in artificial intelligence' s performance on reasoning tasks, particularly demonstrating remarkable capabilities in mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning. However, as a critical component of advanced human cognition, strategic reasoning, i.e., the ability to assess multi-agent behaviors in dynamic environments, formulate action plans, and adapt strategies, has yet to be systematically evaluated or modeled. To address this gap, this paper introduces WGSR-Bench, the first strategy reasoning benchmark for LLMs using wargame as its evaluation environment. Wargame, a quintessential high-complexity strategic scenario, integrates environmental uncertainty, adversarial dynamics, and non-unique strategic choices, making it an effective testbed for assessing LLMs' capabilities in multi-agent decision-making, intent inference, and counterfactual reasoning. WGSR-Bench designs test samples around three core tasks, i.e., Environmental situation awareness, Opponent risk modeling and Policy generation, which serve as the core S-POE architecture, to systematically assess main abilities of strategic reasoning. Finally, an LLM-based wargame agent is designed to integrate these parts for a comprehensive strategy reasoning assessment. With WGSR-Bench, we hope to assess the strengths and limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs in game-theoretic strategic reasoning and to advance research in large model-driven strategic intelligence.

arXiv:2506.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reframed as a cognitive engine driving a novel productivity revolution distinct from the Industrial Revolution's physical thrust. This paper develops a theoretical framing of AI as a cognitive revolution akin to written language - a transformative augmentation of human intellect rather than another mechanized tool. We compare AI's emergence to historical leaps in information technology to show how it amplifies knowledge work. Examples from various domains demonstrate AI's impact as a driver of productivity in cognitive tasks. We adopt a multidisciplinary perspective combining computer science advances with economic insights and sociological perspectives on how AI reshapes work and society. Through conceptual frameworks, we visualize the shift from manual to cognitive productivity. Our central argument is that AI functions as an engine of cognition - comparable to how human language revolutionized knowledge - heralding a new productivity paradigm. We discuss how this revolution demands rethinking of skills, organizations, and policies. This paper, balancing academic rigor with clarity, concludes that AI's promise lies in complementing human cognitive abilities, marking a new chapter in productivity evolution.

Abstract: We establish fundamental computational complexity barriers to verifying AI safety as system capabilities scale. Our main results show that for AI systems with expressiveness EXP$(m)$ above a critical threshold $\tau$, safety verification requires exponential time and is coNP-complete. We formalize the Capability-Risk Scaling (CRS) dynamic, which demonstrates how increasing AI capability drives societal safety requirements toward perfection, creating an inescapable tension with verification complexity. Through four core theorems, we prove that (1) verification complexity grows exponentially with system expressiveness, (2) safe policies comprise at most a $2^{-2^m}$ fraction of the policy space, (3) no finite set of alignment techniques can provide universal coverage, and (4) robust safety properties form measure-zero sets for neural networks. These results characterize an "intractability gap" where practical safety requirements fall within the region of computational intractability. We conclude by presenting a strategic trilemma: AI development must either constrain system complexity to maintain verifiable safety, accept unverifiable risks while scaling capabilities, or develop fundamentally new safety paradigms beyond verification. Our work provides the first systematic complexity-theoretic analysis of AI alignment and establishes rigorous bounds that any safety approach must confront. A formal verification of the core theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.

The article introduces VGC-Bench, a benchmark for developing AI agents that can adapt to diverse strategic landscapes in Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC). With a massive space of possible team configurations, the domain poses a unique challenge for generalization. VGC-Bench provides infrastructure, evaluation protocols, and baselines for research. Various methods, from large-language models to reinforcement learning, are evaluated and compared on a range of team sizes. In a single-team setting, the methods can outperform a professional VGC competitor. However, challenges arise when scaling up to larger team sets, highlighting the difficulty of policy generalization across diverse strategies. The research code is open-sourced for further exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Developing AI agents that can robustly adapt to dramatically different strategic landscapes without retraining is a central challenge for multi-agent learning. Pok\'emon Video Game Championships (VGC) is a domain with an extraordinarily large space of possible team configurations of approximately $10^{139}$ - far larger than those of Dota or Starcraft. The highly discrete, combinatorial nature of team building in Pok\'emon VGC causes optimal strategies to shift dramatically depending on both the team being piloted and the opponent's team, making generalization uniquely challenging. To advance research on this problem, we introduce VGC-Bench: a benchmark that provides critical infrastructure, standardizes evaluation protocols, and supplies human-play datasets and a range of baselines - from large-language-model agents and behavior cloning to reinforcement learning and empirical game-theoretic methods such as self-play, fictitious play, and double oracle. In the restricted setting where an agent is trained and evaluated on a single-team configuration, our methods are able to win against a professional VGC competitor. We extensively evaluated all baseline methods over progressively larger team sets and find that even the best-performing algorithm in the single-team setting struggles at scaling up as team size grows. Thus, policy generalization across diverse team strategies remains an open challenge for the community. Our code is open sourced at https://github.com/cameronangliss/VGC-Bench.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, Minecraft, Mixture-of-Experts architecture, Reinforcement Learning, Optimus-3

Summary:
Optimus-3 is a general-purpose agent for Minecraft that addresses challenges in building a generalist agent with perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments. The agent leverages a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide high-quality training data and introduces a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing to mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks. Furthermore, a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach enhances the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Experimental results show that Optimus-3 outperforms both generalist multimodal large language models and state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

Abstract: Recently, agents based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various domains. However, building a generalist agent with capabilities such as perception, planning, action, grounding, and reflection in open-world environments like Minecraft remains challenges: insufficient domain-specific data, interference among heterogeneous tasks, and visual diversity in open-world settings. In this paper, we address these challenges through three key contributions. 1) We propose a knowledge-enhanced data generation pipeline to provide scalable and high-quality training data for agent development. 2) To mitigate interference among heterogeneous tasks, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with task-level routing. 3) We develop a Multimodal Reasoning-Augmented Reinforcement Learning approach to enhance the agent's reasoning ability for visual diversity in Minecraft. Built upon these innovations, we present Optimus-3, a general-purpose agent for Minecraft. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses both generalist multimodal large language models and existing state-of-the-art agents across a wide range of tasks in the Minecraft environment.

<div> NeuroPAL, neuroevolutionary framework, NEAT, Punctuated Anytime Learning, efficiency<br />
Summary:<br />
NeuroPAL introduces a neuroevolutionary framework combining NEAT with PAL to enhance evolutionary training efficiency in StarCraft: Brood War macromanagement. PAL alternates between frequent, low-fidelity training and high-fidelity evaluations, improving sample efficiency and allowing quicker strategy discovery. In a single-race scenario, NeuroPAL outperformed standard NEAT-based training, reaching competitive levels in half the time. Evolved agents displayed expert strategies like proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization. Structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL show promise in enhancing neuroevolution scalability and effectiveness in complex real-time strategy environments. <br /> <div>

Abstract: StarCraft: Brood War remains a challenging benchmark for artificial intelligence research, particularly in the domain of macromanagement, where long-term strategic planning is required. Traditional approaches to StarCraft AI rely on rule-based systems or supervised deep learning, both of which face limitations in adaptability and computational efficiency. In this work, we introduce NeuroPAL, a neuroevolutionary framework that integrates Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) with Punctuated Anytime Learning (PAL) to improve the efficiency of evolutionary training. By alternating between frequent, low-fidelity training and periodic, high-fidelity evaluations, PAL enhances the sample efficiency of NEAT, enabling agents to discover effective strategies in fewer training iterations. We evaluate NeuroPAL in a fixed-map, single-race scenario in StarCraft: Brood War and compare its performance to standard NEAT-based training. Our results show that PAL significantly accelerates the learning process, allowing the agent to reach competitive levels of play in approximately half the training time required by NEAT alone. Additionally, the evolved agents exhibit emergent behaviors such as proxy barracks placement and defensive building optimization, strategies commonly used by expert human players. These findings suggest that structured evaluation mechanisms like PAL can enhance the scalability and effectiveness of neuroevolution in complex real-time strategy environments.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module, which abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and meta-skills, creating a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. It also proposes the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm to leverage offline-acquired skills for online task planning. Building on these frameworks, the paper introduces Mirage-1, a multimodal GUI agent designed to excel in long-horizon scenarios. The agent outperforms previous models on various benchmarks, including AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, showcasing its efficacy in real-world environments. The proposed approach bridges the knowledge gap between offline and online domains, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and efficiency in GUI agent tasks.

Abstract: Recent efforts to leverage the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) as GUI agents have yielded promising outcomes. However, these agents still struggle with long-horizon tasks in online environments, primarily due to insufficient knowledge and the inherent gap between offline and online domains. In this paper, inspired by how humans generalize knowledge in open-ended environments, we propose a Hierarchical Multimodal Skills (HMS) module to tackle the issue of insufficient knowledge. It progressively abstracts trajectories into execution skills, core skills, and ultimately meta-skills, providing a hierarchical knowledge structure for long-horizon task planning. To bridge the domain gap, we propose the Skill-Augmented Monte Carlo Tree Search (SA-MCTS) algorithm, which efficiently leverages skills acquired in offline environments to reduce the action search space during online tree exploration. Building on HMS, we propose Mirage-1, a multimodal, cross-platform, plug-and-play GUI agent. To validate the performance of Mirage-1 in real-world long-horizon scenarios, we constructed a new benchmark, AndroidLH. Experimental results show that Mirage-1 outperforms previous agents by 32\%, 19\%, 15\%, and 79\% on AndroidWorld, MobileMiniWob++, Mind2Web-Live, and AndroidLH, respectively.

Summary:
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines external retrieval with language generation to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional RAG systems face challenges in real-world scenarios necessitating complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. The shift towards Reasoning Agentic RAG embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use within the retrieval process.

Predefined reasoning utilizes fixed pipelines to boost reasoning, while agentic reasoning allows models to autonomously orchestrate tool interaction during inference. Various techniques under both paradigms are analyzed, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Key research challenges are discussed, along with proposed future directions to improve the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems.<br /><br />Summary: Retrieval-Augmented Generation integrates external retrieval with language generation to enhance Large Language Models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful framework to overcome the knowledge limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external retrieval with language generation. While early RAG systems based on static pipelines have shown effectiveness in well-structured tasks, they struggle in real-world scenarios requiring complex reasoning, dynamic retrieval, and multi-modal integration. To address these challenges, the field has shifted toward Reasoning Agentic RAG, a paradigm that embeds decision-making and adaptive tool use directly into the retrieval process. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of Reasoning Agentic RAG methods, categorizing them into two primary systems: predefined reasoning, which follows fixed modular pipelines to boost reasoning, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously orchestrates tool interaction during inference. We analyze representative techniques under both paradigms, covering architectural design, reasoning strategies, and tool coordination. Finally, we discuss key research challenges and propose future directions to advance the flexibility, robustness, and applicability of reasoning agentic RAG systems.

<div> Keywords: Edge computing, autoscaling, agent-based framework, multi-dimensional, SLO performance

Summary: 
This research introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework for edge computing that dynamically adjusts hardware resources and service configurations to meet requirements in resource-constrained environments. Four scaling agents, including Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, are compared using real-world processing services for visual recognition and QR code detection. Results show that all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with different convergence patterns. The Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis agent converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and suggests potential for further research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge computing breaks with traditional autoscaling due to strict resource constraints, thus, motivating more flexible scaling behaviors using multiple elasticity dimensions. This work introduces an agent-based autoscaling framework that dynamically adjusts both hardware resources and internal service configurations to maximize requirements fulfillment in constrained environments. We compare four types of scaling agents: Active Inference, Deep Q Network, Analysis of Structural Knowledge, and Deep Active Inference, using two real-world processing services running in parallel: YOLOv8 for visual recognition and OpenCV for QR code detection. Results show all agents achieve acceptable SLO performance with varying convergence patterns. While the Deep Q Network benefits from pre-training, the structural analysis converges quickly, and the deep active inference agent combines theoretical foundations with practical scalability advantages. Our findings provide evidence for the viability of multi-dimensional agent-based autoscaling for edge environments and encourage future work in this research direction.

Summary: 
OIBench is introduced as a challenging olympiad-level informatics dataset with 250 original problems, aiming to guide algorithmic reasoning improvements. The dataset is carefully curated to assess various programming paradigms and complexities, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation. Time/Space Completion Curves are proposed for efficient analysis, and high-level participant evaluations enable human-model comparisons.

Abstract: As models become increasingly sophisticated, conventional algorithm benchmarks are increasingly saturated, underscoring the need for more challenging benchmarks to guide future improvements in algorithmic reasoning. This paper introduces OIBench, a high-quality, private, and challenging olympiad-level informatics dataset comprising 250 carefully curated original problems. We detail the construction methodology of the benchmark, ensuring a comprehensive assessment across various programming paradigms and complexities, and we demonstrate its contamination-resistant properties via experiments. We propose Time/Space Completion Curves for finer-grained efficiency analysis and enable direct human-model comparisons through high-level participant evaluations. Our experiments reveal that while open-source models lag behind closed-source counterparts, current SOTA models already outperform most human participants in both correctness and efficiency, while still being suboptimal compared to the canonical solutions. By releasing OIBench as a fully open-source resource (https://huggingface.co/datasets/AGI-Eval/OIBench), we hope this benchmark will contribute to advancing code reasoning capabilities for future LLMs.

Abstract: Scientific discoveries increasingly rely on complex multimodal reasoning based on information-intensive scientific data and domain-specific expertise. Empowered by expert-level scientific benchmarks, scientific Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold the potential to significantly enhance this discovery process in realistic workflows. However, current scientific benchmarks mostly focus on evaluating the knowledge understanding capabilities of MLLMs, leading to an inadequate assessment of their perception and reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we present the Scientists' First Exam (SFE) benchmark, designed to evaluate the scientific cognitive capacities of MLLMs through three interconnected levels: scientific signal perception, scientific attribute understanding, scientific comparative reasoning. Specifically, SFE comprises 830 expert-verified VQA pairs across three question types, spanning 66 multimodal tasks across five high-value disciplines. Extensive experiments reveal that current state-of-the-art GPT-o3 and InternVL-3 achieve only 34.08% and 26.52% on SFE, highlighting significant room for MLLMs to improve in scientific realms. We hope the insights obtained in SFE will facilitate further developments in AI-enhanced scientific discoveries.

Summary:
The article introduces LogiPlan, a benchmark for assessing large language models in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures. It includes three tasks: Plan Generation, Consistency Detection, and Comparison Question, testing models' ability to construct valid graphs, identify inconsistencies, and determine relationship validity. The benchmark allows for dynamic task complexity variation and assesses models' self-correction capabilities. State-of-the-art models were evaluated, revealing performance gaps correlated with model scale and architecture. While reasoning-enhanced models showed promise on simpler tasks, they struggled with more complex configurations requiring deeper logical planning. Overall, LogiPlan provides a fine-grained assessment of model performance in logical reasoning tasks, highlighting challenges in handling complex relational structures for large language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LogiPlan, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in logical planning and reasoning over complex relational structures. Logical relational reasoning is important for applications that may rely on LLMs to generate and query structured graphs of relations such as network infrastructure, knowledge bases, or business process schema. Our framework allows for dynamic variation of task complexity by controlling the number of objects, relations, and the minimum depth of relational chains, providing a fine-grained assessment of model performance across difficulty levels. LogiPlan encompasses three complementary tasks: (1) Plan Generation, where models must construct valid directed relational graphs meeting specified structural constraints; (2) Consistency Detection, testing models' ability to identify inconsistencies in relational structures; and (3) Comparison Question, evaluating models' capacity to determine the validity of queried relationships within a given graph. Additionally, we assess models' self-correction capabilities by prompting them to verify and refine their initial solutions. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.0 Pro, Gemini 2 Flash Thinking, GPT-4.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 405B, O3-mini, O1, and Claude 3.7 Sonnet across these tasks, revealing significant performance gaps that correlate with model scale and architecture. Our analysis demonstrates that while recent reasoning-enhanced models show promising results on simpler instances, they struggle with more complex configurations requiring deeper logical planning.

Summary: 
The Primender sequence is introduced, incorporating prime numbers and modular digit-based conditions. This sequence is designed to evaluate the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. A hypothesis is explored regarding the relationship between consecutive numbers in the sequence. Various state-of-the-art models are tested on inferring the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating future terms of the sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy and sequence validity are used to assess model performance. This study contributes a new mathematical concept and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking Large Language Models in symbolic reasoning and pattern generalization. <div>
arXiv:2506.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Primender sequence, a novel integer sequence defined by a hybrid rule that combines classical primality with modular digit-based conditions. Specifically, a number n is included in the sequence if it is prime or ends with a prime number of unit digit or any length. In other words, numbers which are primes or have at least one prime suffix. The resulting sequence exhibits a deterministic yet non-trivial structure, blending number-theoretic properties with symbolic patterning. We propose the Primender sequence as a benchmark for evaluating the symbolic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The study is motivated by the need for interpretable, rule-based testbeds that can assess an LLM's ability to infer hidden rules, validate mathematical hypotheses, and generalize symbolic logic at scale. A key hypothesis explored is: Whenever a number in the Primender sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it, the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence is also 1. We design a structured prompt and evaluation framework to test this hypothesis across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, Copilot, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, and LLaMA. The models are tasked with identifying the underlying rule, validating the hypothesis, and generating the next 100,000 terms of the sequence. Comparative metrics such as rule inference accuracy, hypothesis evaluation, sequence validity, and symbolic explanation quality are used to assess model performance. This work contributes a novel mathematical construct and a reproducible methodology for benchmarking LLMs in symbolic reasoning, hypothesis testing, and scalable pattern generalization - bridging the domains of number theory, artificial intelligence, and software engineering.

arXiv:2506.10613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostic processes for complex cyber-physical systems often require extensive prior knowledge in the form of detailed system models or comprehensive training data. However, obtaining such information poses a significant challenge. To address this issue, we present a new diagnostic approach that operates with minimal prior knowledge, requiring only a basic understanding of subsystem relationships and data from nominal operations. Our method combines a neural network-based symptom generator, which employs subsystem-level anomaly detection, with a new graph diagnosis algorithm that leverages minimal causal relationship information between subsystems-information that is typically available in practice. Our experiments with fully controllable simulated datasets show that our method includes the true causal component in its diagnosis set for 82 p.c. of all cases while effectively reducing the search space in 73 p.c. of the scenarios. Additional tests on the real-world Secure Water Treatment dataset showcase the approach's potential for practical scenarios. Our results thus highlight our approach's potential for practical applications with large and complex cyber-physical systems where limited prior knowledge is available.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in telecommunications has raised interest in the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to address domain-specific, mathematically intensive tasks. Although recent advancements have improved the performance of LLMs in general mathematical reasoning, their effectiveness within specialized domains, such as signal processing, network optimization, and performance analysis, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce TeleMath, the first benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate LLM performance in solving mathematical problems with numerical solutions in the telecommunications domain. Comprising 500 question-answer (QnA) pairs, TeleMath covers a wide spectrum of topics in the telecommunications field. This paper outlines the proposed QnAs generation pipeline, starting from a selected seed of problems crafted by Subject Matter Experts. The evaluation of a wide range of open-source LLMs reveals that best performance on TeleMath is achieved by recent models explicitly designed for mathematical or logical reasoning. In contrast, general-purpose models, even those with a large number of parameters, often struggle with these challenges. We have released the dataset and the evaluation code to ease result reproducibility and support future research.

Summary: <br />
This work-in-progress paper discusses the formalization and verification of modeling constraints in AutomationML (AML) for standardized data exchange in engineering. The current recommendations for AML modeling are typically presented as informal textual constraints, making automatic validation within AML challenging. However, the proposed pipeline addresses this issue by mapping AML models to OWL ontologies using RML and SPARQL. Textual rules are translated into SHACL constraints by a Large Language Model, which are then validated against the AML ontology. The validation results are automatically interpreted in natural language. By demonstrating the approach on a sample AML recommendation, the study showcases that even complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked without requiring users to have a deep understanding of formal methods or ontology technologies. <div>

Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to understand formal methods or ontology technologies.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT) is an approach to combining answer set programming and satisfiability modulo theories based on the functional stable model semantics. It is shown that the tight fragment of ASPMT programs can be turned into SMT instances, thereby allowing SMT solvers to compute stable models of ASPMT programs. In this paper we present a compiler called {\sc aspsmt2smt}, which implements this translation. The system uses ASP grounder {\sc gringo} and SMT solver {\sc z3}. {\sc gringo} partially grounds input programs while leaving some variables to be processed by {\sc z3}. We demonstrate that the system can effectively handle real number computations for reasoning about continuous changes.

Abstract: Causal and temporal reasoning about video dynamics is a challenging problem. While neuro-symbolic models that combine symbolic reasoning with neural-based perception and prediction have shown promise, they exhibit limitations, especially in answering counterfactual questions. This paper introduces a method to enhance a neuro-symbolic model for counterfactual reasoning, leveraging symbolic reasoning about causal relations among events. We define the notion of a causal graph to represent such relations and use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming method, to find how to coordinate perception and simulation modules. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmarks, CLEVRER and CRAFT. Our enhancement achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CLEVRER challenge, significantly outperforming existing models. In the case of the CRAFT benchmark, we leverage a large pre-trained language model, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, as a proxy for a dynamics simulator. Our findings show that this method can further improve its performance on counterfactual questions by providing alternative prompts instructed by symbolic causal reasoning.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving diverse tasks. To evaluate LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement, OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark, was introduced.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in solving diverse tasks. However, their proficiency in iteratively optimizing complex solutions through learning from previous feedback remains insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we present OPT-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents on large-scale search space optimization problems. OPT-BENCH includes 20 real-world machine learning tasks sourced from Kaggle and 10 classical NP problems, offering a diverse and challenging environment for assessing LLM agents on iterative reasoning and solution refinement. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce OPT-Agent, an end-to-end optimization framework that emulates human reasoning when tackling complex problems by generating, validating, and iteratively improving solutions through leveraging historical feedback. Through extensive experiments on 9 state-of-the-art LLMs from 6 model families, we analyze the effects of optimization iterations, temperature settings, and model architectures on solution quality and convergence. Our results demonstrate that incorporating historical context significantly enhances optimization performance across both ML and NP tasks. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote further research in advancing LLM-driven optimization and iterative reasoning.

Abstract: Human spatiotemporal behavior simulation is critical for urban planning research, yet traditional rule-based and statistical approaches suffer from high computational costs, limited generalizability, and poor scalability. While large language models (LLMs) show promise as "world simulators," they face challenges in spatiotemporal reasoning including limited spatial cognition, lack of physical constraint understanding, and group homogenization tendencies. This paper introduces a framework integrating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enhance LLMs' capability in simulating spatiotemporal behaviors that correspond with validation data patterns. The methodology combines human-like progressive reasoning through a five-stage cognitive framework with comprehensive data processing via six specialized MCP tool categories: temporal management, spatial navigation, environmental perception, personal memory, social collaboration, and experience evaluation. Experiments in Shanghai's Lujiazui district validate the framework's effectiveness across 1,000 generated samples. Results demonstrate high similarity with real mobile signaling data, achieving generation quality scores of 7.86 to 8.36 across different base models. Parallel processing experiments show efficiency improvements, with generation times decreasing from 1.30 to 0.17 minutes per sample when scaling from 2 to 12 processes. This work contributes to integrating CoT reasoning with MCP for urban behavior modeling, advancing LLMs applications in urban computing and providing a practical approach for synthetic mobility data generation. The framework offers a foundation for smart city planning, transportation forecasting, and participatory urban design applications.

Abstract: Classical AI Planning techniques generate sequences of actions for complex tasks. However, they lack the ability to understand planning tasks when provided using natural language. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced novel capabilities in human-computer interaction. In the context of planning tasks, LLMs have shown to be particularly good in interpreting human intents among other uses. This paper introduces GenPlanX that integrates LLMs for natural language-based description of planning tasks, with a classical AI planning engine, alongside an execution and monitoring framework.

<div> benchmark, molecular toxicity repair, Multimodal Large Language Models, ToxiMol, ToxiEval 

Summary: 
The article introduces ToxiMol, a benchmark task for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focusing on molecular toxicity repair. A standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 toxic molecules was constructed, guided by expert toxicological knowledge. An automated evaluation framework called ToxiEval was proposed, integrating toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity for repair success measurement. The study assessed nearly 30 mainstream MLLMs and conducted ablation studies to analyze key factors like evaluation criteria and candidate diversity. Results showed that while current MLLMs face challenges, they are showing promise in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing. <div>

Abstract: Toxicity remains a leading cause of early-stage drug development failure. Despite advances in molecular design and property prediction, the task of molecular toxicity repair - generating structurally valid molecular alternatives with reduced toxicity - has not yet been systematically defined or benchmarked. To fill this gap, we introduce ToxiMol, the first benchmark task for general-purpose Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) focused on molecular toxicity repair. We construct a standardized dataset covering 11 primary tasks and 560 representative toxic molecules spanning diverse mechanisms and granularities. We design a prompt annotation pipeline with mechanism-aware and task-adaptive capabilities, informed by expert toxicological knowledge. In parallel, we propose an automated evaluation framework, ToxiEval, which integrates toxicity endpoint prediction, synthetic accessibility, drug-likeness, and structural similarity into a high-throughput evaluation chain for repair success. We systematically assess nearly 30 mainstream general-purpose MLLMs and design multiple ablation studies to analyze key factors such as evaluation criteria, candidate diversity, and failure attribution. Experimental results show that although current MLLMs still face significant challenges on this task, they begin to demonstrate promising capabilities in toxicity understanding, semantic constraint adherence, and structure-aware molecule editing.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards, mathematical reasoning, spurious rewards, code reasoning

Summary:
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) shows promise in enhancing mathematical reasoning in certain models, even with spurious rewards that may not be directly correlated with the correct answer. The study demonstrates significant performance improvements in the MATH-500 task for the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model using various types of spurious rewards. However, these gains are not necessarily transferable to other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. Notably, RLVR increases the frequency of code reasoning in Qwen2.5-Math models. The researchers suggest that RLVR may elicit useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining when faced with a lack of useful reward signals. Future research on RLVR should consider diverse model testing, as the effectiveness of spurious rewards varies across model types. The exact mechanisms behind the efficacy of RLVR with spurious rewards remain a topic for further investigation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in certain models even with spurious rewards that have little, no, or even negative correlation with the correct answer. For example, RLVR improves MATH-500 performance for Qwen2.5-Math-7B in absolute points by 21.4% (random reward), 13.8% (format reward), 24.1% (incorrect label), 26.0% (1-shot RL), and 27.1% (majority voting) -- nearly matching the 29.1% gained with ground truth rewards. However, the spurious rewards that work for Qwen often fail to yield gains with other model families like Llama3 or OLMo2. In particular, we find code reasoning -- thinking in code without actual code execution -- to be a distinctive Qwen2.5-Math behavior that becomes significantly more frequent after RLVR, from 65% to over 90%, even with spurious rewards. Overall, we hypothesize that, given the lack of useful reward signal, RLVR must somehow be surfacing useful reasoning representations learned during pretraining, although the exact mechanism remains a topic for future work. We suggest that future RLVR research should possibly be validated on diverse models rather than a single de facto choice, as we show that it is easy to get significant performance gains on Qwen models even with completely spurious reward signals.

<div> Keywords: Tina, reasoning models, cost-efficiency, reinforcement learning, LoRA

Summary:
Tina is a family of tiny reasoning models developed with high cost-efficiency, demonstrating that strong reasoning abilities can be achieved using minimal resources. By employing parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement learning (RL) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on a 1.5B parameter base model, Tina achieves competitive reasoning performance with state-of-the-art RL models. The best Tina model shows more than 20% reasoning performance increase and 43.33% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24 at a significantly reduced post-training cost of $9 USD, representing a 260x cost reduction compared to existing models. This approach effectively adapts the model to the rewarded reasoning structure while retaining the base model's knowledge. The research validates the efficiency of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA across various open-source reasoning datasets and ablation settings. All code, training logs, and model weights & checkpoints are open-sourced for accessibility and further research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: How cost-effectively can strong reasoning abilities be achieved in language models? Driven by this fundamental question, we present Tina, a family of tiny reasoning models achieved with high cost-efficiency. Notably, Tina demonstrates that substantial reasoning performance can be developed using only minimal resources, by applying parameter-efficient updates during reinforcement learning (RL), using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), to an already tiny 1.5B parameter base model. This minimalist approach produces models that achieve reasoning performance which is competitive with, and sometimes surpasses, SOTA RL reasoning models built upon the same base model. Crucially, this is achieved at a tiny fraction of the computational post-training cost employed by existing SOTA models. In fact, the best Tina model achieves a >20\% reasoning performance increase and 43.33\% Pass@1 accuracy on AIME24, at only \$9 USD post-training and evaluation cost (i.e., an estimated 260x cost reduction). Our work reveals the surprising effectiveness of efficient RL reasoning via LoRA. We validate this across multiple open-source reasoning datasets and various ablation settings starting with a single, fixed set of hyperparameters. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this effectiveness and efficiency stem from LoRA rapidly adapting the model to the structural format of reasoning rewarded by RL, while largely preserving the base model's underlying knowledge. In service of accessibility and open research, we fully open-source all code, training logs, and model weights \& checkpoints.

Summary: 
The study introduces Resa, a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained using a sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure, aiming to elicit strong reasoning in language models efficiently. This method involves training an SAE to capture reasoning abilities from a source model and using it to guide supervised fine-tuning in a target model without direct reasoning traces. Results show that SAE-Tuning can retain over 97% of reasoning performance seen in RL-trained models while significantly reducing training costs and time. Furthermore, applying SAE-Tuning to lightly RL-trained models leads to improved reasoning performance at minimal additional cost. The extracted reasoning abilities are both generalizable and modular, demonstrating their transferability to different datasets and models. Ablations support these findings, and all related artifacts are openly available. <div>

Abstract: How cost-effectively can we elicit strong reasoning in language models by leveraging their underlying representations? We answer this question with Resa, a family of 1.5B reasoning models trained via a novel and efficient sparse autoencoder tuning (SAE-Tuning) procedure. This method first trains an SAE to capture reasoning abilities from a source model, and then uses the trained SAE to guide a standard supervised fine-tuning process to elicit such abilities in a target model, all using verified question-answer data without any reasoning traces. Notably, when applied to certain base models before further RL post-training, SAE-Tuning retains >97% of its RL-trained counterpart's reasoning performance while reducing training costs by >2000x to roughly \$1 and training time by >450x to around 20 minutes. Furthermore, when applied to lightly RL-trained models (e.g., within 1 hour on 2 GPUs), it enables reasoning performance such as 43.33% Pass@1 on AIME24 and 90% Pass@1 on AMC23 for only around \$1 additional cost. Surprisingly, the reasoning abilities extracted via SAEs are potentially both generalizable and modular. Generality means abilities extracted from one dataset still elevate performance on a larger and overlapping corpus. Modularity means abilities extracted from Qwen or Qwen-Math can be attached to the R1-Distill model at test time, without any retraining, and yield comparable gains. Extensive ablations validate these findings and all artifacts are fully open-sourced.

Abstract: With technology advancing and the pursuit of new audiovisual experiences strengthening, the metaverse has gained surging enthusiasm. However, it faces practical hurdles as substantial data like high-resolution virtual scenes must be transmitted between cloud platforms and VR devices. Specifically, the VR device's wireless transmission hampered by insufficient bandwidth, causes speed and delay problems. Meanwhile, poor channel quality leads to data errors and worsens user experience. To solve this, we've proposed the Semantic Communication-Enabled Cloud-Edge-End Collaborative Immersive Metaverse Service (SC-CEE-Meta) Architecture, which includes three modules: VR video semantic transmission, video synthesis, and 3D virtual scene reconstruction. By deploying semantic modules on VR devices and edge servers and sending key semantic info instead of focusing on bit-level reconstruction, it can cut latency, resolve the resource-bandwidth conflict, and better withstand channel interference. Also, the cloud deploys video synthesis and 3D scene reconstruction preprocessing, while edge devices host 3D reconstruction rendering modules, all for immersive services. Verified on Meta Quest Pro, the SC-CEE-Meta can reduce wireless transmission delay by 96.05\% and boost image quality by 43.99\% under poor channel condition.

Summary:
Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) is a challenging problem in traffic scenes aiming for zero fatalities. Current supervised learning approaches for TAA face difficulties due to the unpredictable and evolving nature of traffic scenes. To address this issue, an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model is proposed, generating causal video frames from normal dashcam clips. AVD can be trained without additional annotations and enables Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) by creating contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Experimental results show competitive performance compared to existing methods. The AVD model synthesizes accident-related content based on text prompts, maintaining the original style and content of frames. This approach enhances TAA accuracy and mitigates data bias, potentially contributing to safer driving environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traffic Accident Anticipation (TAA) in traffic scenes is a challenging problem for achieving zero fatalities in the future. Current approaches typically treat TAA as a supervised learning task needing the laborious annotation of accident occurrence duration. However, the inherent long-tailed, uncertain, and fast-evolving nature of traffic scenes has the problem that real causal parts of accidents are difficult to identify and are easily dominated by data bias, resulting in a background confounding issue. Thus, we propose an Attentive Video Diffusion (AVD) model that synthesizes additional accident video clips by generating the causal part in dashcam videos, i.e., from normal clips to accident clips. AVD aims to generate causal video frames based on accident or accident-free text prompts while preserving the style and content of frames for TAA after video generation. This approach can be trained using datasets collected from various driving scenes without any extra annotations. Additionally, AVD facilitates an Equivariant TAA (EQ-TAA) with an equivariant triple loss for an anchor accident-free video clip, along with the generated pair of contrastive pseudo-normal and pseudo-accident clips. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of AVD and EQ-TAA, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods has been obtained.

Abstract: Current HER2 assessment models for breast cancer predominantly analyze H&amp;E or IHC images in isolation,despite clinical reliance on their synergistic interpretation. However, concurrent acquisition of both modalities is often hindered by workflow complexity and cost constraints. We propose an adaptive bimodal framework enabling flexible single-/dual-modality HER2 prediction through three innovations: 1) A dynamic branch selector that activates either single-modality reconstruction or dual-modality joint inference based on input completeness; 2) A bidirectional cross-modal GAN performing context-aware feature-space reconstruction of missing modalities; 3) A hybrid training protocol integrating adversarial learning and multi-task optimization. This architecture elevates single-modality H&amp;E prediction accuracy from 71.44% to 94.25% while achieving 95.09% dual-modality accuracy, maintaining 90.28% reliability with sole IHC inputs. The framework's "dual-preferred, single-compatible" design delivers near-bimodal performance without requiring synchronized acquisition, particularly benefiting resource-limited settings through IHC infrastructure cost reduction. Experimental validation confirms 22.81%/12.90% accuracy improvements over H&amp;E/IHC baselines respectively, with cross-modal reconstruction enhancing F1-scores to 0.9609 (HE to IHC) and 0.9251 (IHC to HE). By dynamically routing inputs through reconstruction-enhanced or native fusion pathways, the system mitigates performance degradation from missing data while preserving computational efficiency (78.55% parameter reduction in lightweight variant). This elastic architecture demonstrates significant potential for democratizing precise HER2 assessment across diverse healthcare settings.

<div> Keywords: Audio-driven, emotional 3D facial animation, multimodal emotion binding, latent diffusion model, attention-based, expressive control.

Summary:
Our work addresses the challenges in audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation by introducing a diffusion-based framework. We propose a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that aligns different modalities such as text, audio, and emotion labels through contrastive learning, allowing for flexible emotion control. Additionally, we introduce an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers to enhance motion diversity while maintaining natural facial dynamics. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving a 21.6% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving physiologically plausible facial dynamics. The project page provides further details on the methodology and results. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Audio-driven emotional 3D facial animation encounters two significant challenges: (1) reliance on single-modal control signals (videos, text, or emotion labels) without leveraging their complementary strengths for comprehensive emotion manipulation, and (2) deterministic regression-based mapping that constrains the stochastic nature of emotional expressions and non-verbal behaviors, limiting the expressiveness of synthesized animations. To address these challenges, we present a diffusion-based framework for controllable expressive 3D facial animation. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) a FLAME-centered multimodal emotion binding strategy that aligns diverse modalities (text, audio, and emotion labels) through contrastive learning, enabling flexible emotion control from multiple signal sources, and (2) an attention-based latent diffusion model with content-aware attention and emotion-guided layers, which enriches motion diversity while maintaining temporal coherence and natural facial dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across most metrics, achieving a 21.6\% improvement in emotion similarity while preserving physiologically plausible facial dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical knowledge graph framework for the structured understanding of visual narratives, focusing on multimodal media such as comics. The proposed method decomposes narrative content into multiple levels, from macro-level story arcs to fine-grained event segments. It represents them through integrated knowledge graphs that capture semantic, spatial, and temporal relationships. At the panel level, we construct multimodal graphs that link visual elements such as characters, objects, and actions with corresponding textual components, including dialogue and captions. These graphs are integrated across narrative levels to support reasoning over story structure, character continuity, and event progression.
  We apply our approach to a manually annotated subset of the Manga109 dataset and demonstrate its ability to support symbolic reasoning across diverse narrative tasks, including action retrieval, dialogue tracing, character appearance mapping, and panel timeline reconstruction. Evaluation results show high precision and recall across tasks, validating the coherence and interpretability of the framework. This work contributes a scalable foundation for narrative-based content analysis, interactive storytelling, and multimodal reasoning in visual media.

<div> wavelet-driven multimodal intent recognition, non-verbal cues, frequency-domain analysis, cross-modal interaction, semantic information<br />
Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition (WDMIR) framework for accurately interpreting user intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information. The framework utilizes frequency-domain analysis to enhance intent understanding, with a wavelet-driven fusion module performing synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features. This enables fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics, improving semantic information extraction from non-verbal cues. Additionally, a cross-modal interaction mechanism facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration, bridging the gap between verbal and non-verbal information. Experimental results on MIntRec show state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods with a 1.13% increase in accuracy. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the wavelet-driven fusion module, leading to a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MIR) seeks to accurately interpret user intentions by integrating verbal and non-verbal information across video, audio and text modalities. While existing approaches prioritize text analysis, they often overlook the rich semantic content embedded in non-verbal cues. This paper presents a novel Wavelet-Driven Multimodal Intent Recognition(WDMIR) framework that enhances intent understanding through frequency-domain analysis of non-verbal information. To be more specific, we propose: (1) a wavelet-driven fusion module that performs synchronized decomposition and integration of video-audio features in the frequency domain, enabling fine-grained analysis of temporal dynamics; (2) a cross-modal interaction mechanism that facilitates progressive feature enhancement from bimodal to trimodal integration, effectively bridging the semantic gap between verbal and non-verbal information. Extensive experiments on MIntRec demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing previous methods by 1.13% on accuracy. Ablation studies further verify that the wavelet-driven fusion module significantly improves the extraction of semantic information from non-verbal sources, with a 0.41% increase in recognition accuracy when analyzing subtle emotional cues.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rapidly evolved beyond text generation, now spanning diverse output modalities including images, music, video, human motion, and 3D objects, by integrating language with other sensory modalities under unified architectures. This survey categorises six primary generative modalities and examines how foundational techniques, namely Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), Mixture of Experts (MoE), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, enable cross-modal capabilities. We analyze key models, architectural trends, and emergent cross-modal synergies, while highlighting transferable techniques and unresolved challenges. Architectural innovations like transformers and diffusion models underpin this convergence, enabling cross-modal transfer and modular specialization. We highlight emerging patterns of synergy, and identify open challenges in evaluation, modularity, and structured reasoning. This survey offers a unified perspective on MLLM development and identifies critical paths toward more general-purpose, adaptive, and interpretable multimodal systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly enhanced generative AI capabilities across text, images, and audio. However, automatically evaluating the quality of these generated outputs presents ongoing challenges. Although numerous automatic evaluation methods exist, current research lacks a systematic framework that comprehensively organizes these methods across text, visual, and audio modalities. To address this issue, we present a comprehensive review and a unified taxonomy of automatic evaluation methods for generated content across all three modalities; We identify five fundamental paradigms that characterize existing evaluation approaches across these domains. Our analysis begins by examining evaluation methods for text generation, where techniques are most mature. We then extend this framework to image and audio generation, demonstrating its broad applicability. Finally, we discuss promising directions for future research in cross-modal evaluation methodologies.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RAAI, a framework for aligning large language models (LLMs) using synthetic data. RAAI repurposes LLM attack techniques by detecting refusal signals and injecting predefined phrases to generate harmful yet fluent completions. Experiments show that RAAI significantly increases the harmful response rate of LLMs. Fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data from RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while maintaining performance on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This innovative approach demonstrates how LLM attack methodologies can be utilized as practical tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Abstract: Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive human-labeled preference data, a process that's both costly and time-consuming. While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward, training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and controllable safety alignment.

Summary: 
The article discusses the vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreak attacks in code generation, specifically focusing on their susceptibility to crafted prompts for generating malicious outputs. To address this issue, the authors introduce MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset comprising 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation. The dataset includes 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements that cover 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experimental results reveal that mainstream LLMs show limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, with an average rejection rate of 60.93%. However, this rate drops to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack algorithms, indicating a further reduction in the model's security capabilities. The study emphasizes the ongoing challenges in enhancing the code security capabilities of LLMs. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about their security, particularly their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks that leverage crafted prompts to generate malicious outputs. While prior research has been conducted on general security capabilities of LLMs, their specific susceptibility to jailbreak attacks in code generation remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose MalwareBench, a benchmark dataset containing 3,520 jailbreaking prompts for malicious code-generation, designed to evaluate LLM robustness against such threats. MalwareBench is based on 320 manually crafted malicious code generation requirements, covering 11 jailbreak methods and 29 code functionality categories. Experiments show that mainstream LLMs exhibit limited ability to reject malicious code-generation requirements, and the combination of multiple jailbreak methods further reduces the model's security capabilities: specifically, the average rejection rate for malicious content is 60.93%, dropping to 39.92% when combined with jailbreak attack algorithms. Our work highlights that the code security capabilities of LLMs still pose significant challenges.

Summary:
Private Memorization Editing (PME) is introduced as a method to prevent leakage of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach utilizes the memorization ability of LLMs to enhance privacy defense. PME detects and mitigates memorized PII by editing the model's knowledge of training data without affecting its performance. By leveraging knowledge from the training data, PME enhances the model's robustness against privacy attacks. The approach effectively reduces the leakage of PII in various settings, sometimes even completely thwarting privacy attacks. PME demonstrates the potential to enhance privacy protection in LLMs by utilizing their memorization capabilities for privacy defense. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize, and thus, among huge amounts of uncontrolled data, may memorize Personally Identifiable Information (PII), which should not be stored and, consequently, not leaked. In this paper, we introduce Private Memorization Editing (PME), an approach for preventing private data leakage that turns an apparent limitation, that is, the LLMs' memorization ability, into a powerful privacy defense strategy. While attacks against LLMs have been performed exploiting previous knowledge regarding their training data, our approach aims to exploit the same kind of knowledge in order to make a model more robust. We detect a memorized PII and then mitigate the memorization of PII by editing a model knowledge of its training data. We verify that our procedure does not affect the underlying language model while making it more robust against privacy Training Data Extraction attacks. We demonstrate that PME can effectively reduce the number of leaked PII in a number of configurations, in some cases even reducing the accuracy of the privacy attacks to zero.

Abstract: As Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) evolves into service-oriented platforms (Rag-as-a-Service) with shared knowledge bases, protecting the copyright of contributed data becomes essential. Existing watermarking methods in RAG focus solely on textual knowledge, leaving image knowledge unprotected. In this work, we propose AQUA, the first watermark framework for image knowledge protection in Multimodal RAG systems. AQUA embeds semantic signals into synthetic images using two complementary methods: acronym-based triggers and spatial relationship cues. These techniques ensure watermark signals survive indirect watermark propagation from image retriever to textual generator, being efficient, effective and imperceptible. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that AQUA enables robust, stealthy, and reliable copyright tracing, filling a key gap in multimodal RAG protection.

Summary: <br />
Recent advancements in text-to-image generation have led to the development of expressive models like diffusion transformers (DiTs), such as FLUX. However, these models have large parameter sizes, which result in slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration methods, such as single-step distillation and attention pruning, often suffer from performance degradation and high training costs. In response to these challenges, FastFLUX is introduced as an architecture-level pruning framework aimed at enhancing the inference efficiency of FLUX. FastFLUX utilizes the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method to replace structurally complex residual branches with lightweight linear layers while maintaining original shortcut connections for stability. Additionally, the framework employs a localized fine-tuning strategy called Sandwich Training (ST) to mitigate performance drops due to structural replacement. Experimental results demonstrate that FastFLUX maintains high image quality while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20% of the hierarchy pruned.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have led to the emergence of highly expressive models such as diffusion transformers (DiTs), exemplified by FLUX. However, their massive parameter sizes lead to slow inference, high memory usage, and poor deployability. Existing acceleration methods (e.g., single-step distillation and attention pruning) often suffer from significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs. To address these limitations, we propose FastFLUX, an architecture-level pruning framework designed to enhance the inference efficiency of FLUX. At its core is the Block-wise Replacement with Linear Layers (BRLL) method, which replaces structurally complex residual branches in ResBlocks with lightweight linear layers while preserving the original shortcut connections for stability. Furthermore, we introduce Sandwich Training (ST), a localized fine-tuning strategy that leverages LoRA to supervise neighboring blocks, mitigating performance drops caused by structural replacement. Experiments show that our FastFLUX maintains high image quality under both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, while significantly improving inference speed, even with 20\% of the hierarchy pruned. Our code will be available soon.

Summary:
Ambient Diffusion Omni presents a framework that utilizes low-quality and out-of-distribution images to enhance diffusion models. By leveraging the properties of natural images such as spectral power law decay and locality, this framework successfully trains diffusion models with synthetically corrupted images. The approach leads to state-of-the-art ImageNet FID scores and improves both image quality and diversity in text-to-image generative modeling. The key insight lies in utilizing noise to overcome the initial distribution skew, ultimately enhancing the learning process. The framework is theoretically justified by analyzing the trade-off between biased data and limited unbiased data throughout diffusion times. <div>
arXiv:2506.10038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to use low-quality, synthetic, and out-of-distribution images to improve the quality of a diffusion model. Typically, diffusion models are trained on curated datasets that emerge from highly filtered data pools from the Web and other sources. We show that there is immense value in the lower-quality images that are often discarded. We present Ambient Diffusion Omni, a simple, principled framework to train diffusion models that can extract signal from all available images during training. Our framework exploits two properties of natural images -- spectral power law decay and locality. We first validate our framework by successfully training diffusion models with images synthetically corrupted by Gaussian blur, JPEG compression, and motion blur. We then use our framework to achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet FID, and we show significant improvements in both image quality and diversity for text-to-image generative modeling. The core insight is that noise dampens the initial skew between the desired high-quality distribution and the mixed distribution we actually observe. We provide rigorous theoretical justification for our approach by analyzing the trade-off between learning from biased data versus limited unbiased data across diffusion times.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a cornerstone of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) due to its simplicity and efficiency. However, existing DPO-based approaches typically treat all preference pairs uniformly, ignoring critical variations in their inherent quality and learning utility, leading to suboptimal data utilization and performance. To address this challenge, we propose Omni-DPO, a dual-perspective optimization framework that jointly accounts for (1) the inherent quality of each preference pair and (2) the model's evolving performance on those pairs. By adaptively weighting samples according to both data quality and the model's learning dynamics during training, Omni-DPO enables more effective training data utilization and achieves better performance. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of Omni-DPO. On textual understanding tasks, Gemma-2-9b-it finetuned with Omni-DPO beats the leading LLM, Claude 3 Opus, by a significant margin of 6.7 points on the Arena-Hard benchmark. On mathematical reasoning tasks, Omni-DPO consistently outperforms the baseline methods across all benchmarks, providing strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

<div> Bayesian, uncertainty quantification, large language models, prompts, Metropolis-Hastings 

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of accurately quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs), which is crucial for their application in high-stakes domains. By viewing LLMs through a Bayesian lens and interpreting prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, the authors introduce a novel approach for uncertainty quantification. They propose Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods to perform Bayesian inference. This method enables principled uncertainty quantification over both the model's textual parameters and its predictions, while incorporating prior beliefs expressed in free-form text. Empirical results demonstrate improvements in predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification on various LLM benchmarks and tasks, offering a promising pathway for integrating Bayesian methods into the era of large language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable of solving challenging real-world tasks, accurately quantifying their uncertainty remains a critical open problem, which limits their applicability in high-stakes domains. This challenge is further compounded by the closed-source, black-box nature of many state-of-the-art LLMs. Moreover, LLM-based systems can be highly sensitive to the prompts that bind them together, which often require significant manual tuning (i.e., prompt engineering). In this work, we address these challenges by viewing LLM-based systems through a Bayesian lens. We interpret prompts as textual parameters in a statistical model, allowing us to use a small training dataset to perform Bayesian inference over these prompts. This novel perspective enables principled uncertainty quantification over both the model's textual parameters and its downstream predictions, while also incorporating prior beliefs about these parameters expressed in free-form text. To perform Bayesian inference, a difficult problem even for well-studied data modalities, we introduce Metropolis-Hastings through LLM Proposals (MHLP), a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines prompt optimization techniques with standard MCMC methods. MHLP is a turnkey modification to existing LLM pipelines, including those that rely exclusively on closed-source models. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method yields improvements in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on a range of LLM benchmarks and UQ tasks. More broadly, our work demonstrates a viable path for incorporating methods from the rich Bayesian literature into the era of LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and calibrated LLM-based systems.

<div> Keywords: Semantic degeneracy, Large Language Models, Kolmogorov complexity, Interpretation, Contextuality

Summary: 
Semantic degeneracy, a property of natural language, poses challenges for modern NLP systems due to the increasing complexity of semantic expressions. The likelihood of recovering the single intended meaning diminishes as expression complexity grows, challenging the classical view of linguistic meaning. Meaning is proposed to be actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act rather than inherent in linguistic forms. A semantic Bell inequality test using LLM agents showed non-classical contextuality in linguistic interpretation under ambiguity. This challenges frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language and suggests Bayesian-style repeated sampling for more accurate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context. <div>

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in complexity. Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems face inherent limitations precisely because they operate within natural language itself, making them subject to the same interpretive constraints imposed by semantic degeneracy. In this work, we argue using Kolmogorov complexity that as an expression's complexity grows, the likelihood of any interpreting agent (human or LLM-powered AI) recovering the single intended meaning vanishes. This computational intractability suggests the classical view that linguistic forms possess meaning in and of themselves is flawed. We alternatively posit that meaning is instead actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act. To test this, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents as ``computational cognitive systems'' to interpret ambiguous word pairs under varied contextual settings. Across several independent experiments, we found average CHSH expectation values ranging from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs yielding values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) that significantly violate the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$). This demonstrates that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.

Abstract: We propose a test-time adaptation method that enables a progress estimation model to adapt online to the visual and temporal context of test trajectories by optimizing a learned self-supervised objective. To this end, we introduce a gradient-based meta-learning strategy to train the model on expert visual trajectories and their natural language task descriptions, such that test-time adaptation improves progress estimation relying on semantic content over temporal order. Our test-time adaptation method generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art in-context learning approach using autoregressive vision-language models.

Abstract: Robotics and artificial intelligence hold significant potential for advancing precision agriculture. While robotic systems have been successfully deployed for various tasks, adapting them to perform diverse missions remains challenging, particularly because end users often lack technical expertise. In this paper, we present an end-to-end system that leverages large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, to enable users to assign complex data collection tasks to autonomous robots using natural language instructions. To enhance reusability, mission plans are encoded using an existing IEEE task specification standard, and are executed on robots via ROS2 nodes that bridge high-level mission descriptions with existing ROS libraries. Through extensive experiments, we highlight the strengths and limitations of LLMs in this context, particularly regarding spatial reasoning and solving complex routing challenges, and show how our proposed implementation overcomes them.

<title>Learning to Collaborate Over Graphs: A Selective Federated Multi-Task Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: We present a novel federated multi-task learning method that leverages cross-client similarity to enable personalized learning for each client. To avoid transmitting the entire model to the parameter server, we propose a communication-efficient scheme that introduces a feature anchor, a compact vector representation that summarizes the features learned from the client's local classes. This feature anchor is shared with the server to account for local clients' distribution. In addition, the clients share the classification heads, a lightweight linear layer, and perform a graph-based regularization to enable collaboration among clients. By modeling collaboration between clients as a dynamic graph and continuously updating and refining this graph, we can account for any drift from the clients. To ensure beneficial knowledge transfer and prevent negative collaboration, we leverage a community detection-based approach that partitions this dynamic graph into homogeneous communities, maximizing the sum of task similarities, represented as the graph edges' weights, within each community. This mechanism restricts collaboration to highly similar clients within their formed communities, ensuring positive interaction and preserving personalization. Extensive experiments on two heterogeneous datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that our method exhibits superior computation and communication efficiency and promotes fairness across clients.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming precision agriculture, offering farmers new tools to streamline their daily operations. While these technological advances promise increased efficiency, they often introduce additional complexity and steep learning curves that are particularly challenging for non-technical users who must balance tech adoption with existing workloads. In this paper, we present a natural language (NL) robotic mission planner that enables non-specialists to control heterogeneous robots through a common interface. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and predefined primitives, our architecture seamlessly translates human language into intermediate descriptions that can be executed by different robotic platforms. With this system, users can formulate complex agricultural missions without writing any code. In the work presented in this paper, we extend our previous system tailored for wheeled robot mission planning through a new class of experiments involving robotic manipulation and computer vision tasks. Our results demonstrate that the architecture is both general enough to support a diverse set of robots and powerful enough to execute complex mission requests. This work represents a significant step toward making robotic automation in precision agriculture more accessible to non-technical users.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) in the task of multi-classifying images containing lesions of psoriasis and diseases similar to it. Models pre-trained on ImageNet were adapted to a specific data set. Both achieved high predictive metrics, but the ViTs stood out for their superior performance with smaller models. Dual Attention Vision Transformer-Base (DaViT-B) obtained the best results, with an f1-score of 96.4%, and is recommended as the most efficient architecture for automated psoriasis detection. This article reinforces the potential of ViTs for medical image classification tasks.

Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning (BC) methods trained with supervised learning (SL) are an effective way to learn policies from human demonstrations in domains like robotics. Goal-conditioning these policies enables a single generalist policy to capture diverse behaviors contained within an offline dataset. While goal-conditioned behavior cloning (GCBC) methods can perform well on in-distribution training tasks, they do not necessarily generalize zero-shot to tasks that require conditioning on novel state-goal pairs, i.e. combinatorial generalization. In part, this limitation can be attributed to a lack of temporal consistency in the state representation learned by BC; if temporally related states are encoded to similar latent representations, then the out-of-distribution gap for novel state-goal pairs would be reduced. Hence, encouraging this temporal consistency in the representation space should facilitate combinatorial generalization. Successor representations, which encode the distribution of future states visited from the current state, nicely encapsulate this property. However, previous methods for learning successor representations have relied on contrastive samples, temporal-difference (TD) learning, or both. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective representation learning objective, $\text{BYOL-}\gamma$ augmented GCBC, which is not only able to theoretically approximate the successor representation in the finite MDP case without contrastive samples or TD learning, but also, results in competitive empirical performance across a suite of challenging tasks requiring combinatorial generalization.

Abstract: We partially reverse-engineer a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to play the puzzle game Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning. Prior work found that this network solves more levels with more test-time compute. Our analysis reveals several mechanisms analogous to components of classic bidirectional search. For each square, the RNN represents its plan in the activations of channels associated with specific directions. These state-action activations are analogous to a value function - their magnitudes determine when to backtrack and which plan branch survives pruning. Specialized kernels extend these activations (containing plan and value) forward and backward to create paths, forming a transition model. The algorithm is also unlike classical search in some ways. State representation is not unified; instead, the network considers each box separately. Each layer has its own plan representation and value function, increasing search depth. Far from being inscrutable, the mechanisms leveraging test-time compute learned in this network by model-free training can be understood in familiar terms.

Abstract: To steer pretrained language models for downstream tasks, today's post-training paradigm relies on humans to specify desired behaviors. However, for models with superhuman capabilities, it is difficult or impossible to get high-quality human supervision. To address this challenge, we introduce a new unsupervised algorithm, Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM), to fine-tune pretrained language models on their own generated labels, \emph{without external supervision}. On GSM8k-verification, TruthfulQA, and Alpaca reward modeling tasks, our method matches the performance of training on golden supervision and outperforms training on crowdsourced human supervision. On tasks where LMs' capabilities are strongly superhuman, our method can elicit those capabilities significantly better than training on human labels. Finally, we show that our method can improve the training of frontier LMs: we use our method to train an unsupervised reward model and use reinforcement learning to train a Claude 3.5 Haiku-based assistant. Both the reward model and the assistant outperform their human-supervised counterparts.

Abstract: Human capital (HC) is increasingly important to corporate value creation. Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety; labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.

Abstract: Story generation has been a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, understanding LLMs' ability to produce high-quality stories remains limited due to challenges in automatic evaluation methods and the high cost and subjectivity of manual evaluation. Computational narratology offers valuable insights into what constitutes a good story, which has been applied in the symbolic narrative planning approach to story generation. This work aims to deepen the understanding of LLMs' story generation capabilities by using them to solve narrative planning problems. We present a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on narrative planning based on literature examples, focusing on causal soundness, character intentionality, and dramatic conflict. Our experiments show that GPT-4 tier LLMs can generate causally sound stories at small scales, but planning with character intentionality and dramatic conflict remains challenging, requiring LLMs trained with reinforcement learning for complex reasoning. The results offer insights on the scale of stories that LLMs can generate while maintaining quality from different aspects. Our findings also highlight interesting problem solving behaviors and shed lights on challenges and considerations for applying LLM narrative planning in game environments.

Abstract: Large Language Model agents have begun to appear as personal assistants, customer service bots, and clinical aides. While these applications deliver substantial operational benefits, they also require continuous access to sensitive data, which increases the likelihood of unauthorized disclosures. This study proposes an auditing framework for conversational privacy that quantifies and audits these risks. The proposed Conversational Manipulation for Privacy Leakage (CMPL) framework, is an iterative probing strategy designed to stress-test agents that enforce strict privacy directives. Rather than focusing solely on a single disclosure event, CMPL simulates realistic multi-turn interactions to systematically uncover latent vulnerabilities. Our evaluation on diverse domains, data modalities, and safety configurations demonstrate the auditing framework's ability to reveal privacy risks that are not deterred by existing single-turn defenses. In addition to introducing CMPL as a diagnostic tool, the paper delivers (1) an auditing procedure grounded in quantifiable risk metrics and (2) an open benchmark for evaluation of conversational privacy across agent implementations.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) presents a complex challenge in embodied AI, requiring agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate through visually rich, unfamiliar environments. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs), such as CLIP and Flamingo, have significantly improved multimodal understanding but introduced new challenges related to computational cost and real-time deployment. In this project, we propose a modular, plug-and-play navigation framework that decouples vision-language understanding from action planning. By integrating a frozen vision-language model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, with lightweight planning logic, we aim to achieve flexible, fast, and adaptable navigation without extensive model fine-tuning. Our framework leverages prompt engineering, structured history management, and a two-frame visual input strategy to enhance decision-making continuity across navigation steps. We evaluate our system on the Room-to-Room benchmark within the VLN-CE setting using the Matterport3D dataset and Habitat-Lab simulation environment. Although our initial results reveal challenges in generalizing to unseen environments under strict evaluation settings, our modular approach lays a foundation for scalable and efficient navigation systems, highlighting promising directions for future improvement through enhanced environmental priors and expanded multimodal input integration.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable Prompt-Aware R\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant computational costs. We release our code on the project page: https://mjalali.github.io/SPARKE

Using machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes has yielded encouraging results. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, this study attempts to evaluate the efficacy of several machine-learning methods for diabetes prediction. The collection includes information on 768 patients, such as their ages, BMIs, and glucose levels. The techniques assessed are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Network. The findings indicate that the Neural Network algorithm performed the best, with an accuracy of 78.57 percent, followed by the Random Forest method, with an accuracy of 76.30 percent. The study implies that machine learning algorithms can aid diabetes prediction and be an efficient early detection tool.

Abstract: This study conducts an empirical examination of MLP networks investigated through a rigorous methodical experimentation process involving three diverse datasets: TinyFace, Heart Disease, and Iris. Study Overview: The study includes three key methods: a) a baseline training using the default settings for the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), b) feature selection using Genetic Algorithm (GA) based refinement c) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based dimension reduction. The results show important information on how such techniques affect performance. While PCA had showed benefits in low-dimensional and noise-free datasets GA consistently increased accuracy in complex datasets by accurately identifying critical features. Comparison reveals that feature selection and dimensionality reduction play interdependent roles in enhancing MLP performance. The study contributes to the literature on feature engineering and neural network parameter optimization, offering practical guidelines for a wide range of machine learning tasks

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion models have achieved impressive performance in 3D molecule generation. These models incorporate Euclidean symmetries of 3D molecules by utilizing an SE(3)-equivariant denoising network. However, specialized equivariant architectures limit the scalability and efficiency of diffusion models. In this paper, we propose an approach that relaxes such equivariance constraints. Specifically, our approach learns a sample-dependent SO(3) transformation for each molecule to construct an aligned latent space. A non-equivariant diffusion model is then trained over the aligned representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs significantly better than previously reported non-equivariant models. It yields sample quality comparable to state-of-the-art equivariant diffusion models and offers improved training and sampling efficiency. Our code is available at https://github.com/skeletondyh/RADM

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities across a broad range of tasks including Olympiad-level mathematical problems, indicating evidence of their complex reasoning abilities. While many reasoning benchmarks focus on the STEM domain, the ability of LRMs to reason correctly in broader task domains remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{TTT-Bench}, a new benchmark that is designed to evaluate basic strategic, spatial, and logical reasoning abilities in LRMs through a suite of four two-player Tic-Tac-Toe-style games that humans can effortlessly solve from a young age. We propose a simple yet scalable programmatic approach for generating verifiable two-player game problems for TTT-Bench. Although these games are trivial for humans, they require reasoning about the intentions of the opponent, as well as the game board's spatial configurations, to ensure a win. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art LRMs, and \textbf{discover that the models that excel at hard math problems frequently fail at these simple reasoning games}. Further testing reveals that our evaluated reasoning models score on average $\downarrow$ 41\% \& $\downarrow$ 5\% lower on TTT-Bench compared to MATH 500 \& AIME 2024 respectively, with larger models achieving higher performance using shorter reasoning traces, where most of the models struggle on long-term strategic reasoning situations on simple and new TTT-Bench tasks.

Abstract: Simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiogram (PCG) provide a comprehensive, multimodal perspective on cardiac function by capturing the heart's electrical and mechanical activities, respectively. However, the distinct and overlapping information content of these signals, as well as their potential for mutual reconstruction and biomarker extraction, remains incompletely understood, especially under varying physiological conditions and across individuals.
  In this study, we systematically investigate the common and exclusive characteristics of ECG and PCG using the EPHNOGRAM dataset of simultaneous ECG-PCG recordings during rest and exercise. We employ a suite of linear and nonlinear machine learning models, including non-causal LSTM networks, to reconstruct each modality from the other and analyze the influence of causality, physiological state, and cross-subject variability. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear models, particularly non-causal LSTM, provide superior reconstruction performance, with reconstructing ECG from PCG proving more tractable than the reverse. Exercise and cross-subject scenarios present significant challenges, but envelope-based modeling that utilizes instantaneous amplitude features substantially improves cross-subject generalizability for cross-modal learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that clinically relevant ECG biomarkers, such as fiducial points and QT intervals, can be estimated from PCG in cross-subject settings.
  These findings advance our understanding of the relationship between electromechanical cardiac modalities, in terms of both waveform characteristics and the timing of cardiac events, with potential applications in novel multimodal cardiac monitoring technologies.

<title>Fine-Grained control over Music Generation with Activation Steering</title>

Abstract: We present a method for fine-grained control over music generation through inference-time interventions on an autoregressive generative music transformer called MusicGen. Our approach enables timbre transfer, style transfer, and genre fusion by steering the residual stream using weights of linear probes trained on it, or by steering the attention layer activations in a similar manner. We observe that modelling this as a regression task provides improved performance, hypothesizing that the mean-squared-error better preserve meaningful directional information in the activation space. Combined with the global conditioning offered by text prompts in MusicGen, our method provides both global and local control over music generation. Audio samples illustrating our method are available at our demo page.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose ScoreMix, a novel yet simple data augmentation strategy leveraging the score compositional properties of diffusion models to enhance discriminator performance, particularly under scenarios with limited labeled data. By convexly mixing the scores from different class-conditioned trajectories during diffusion sampling, we generate challenging synthetic samples that significantly improve discriminative capabilities in all studied benchmarks. We systematically investigate class-selection strategies for mixing and discover that greater performance gains arise when combining classes distant in the discriminator's embedding space, rather than close in the generator's condition space. Moreover, we empirically show that, under standard metrics, the correlation between the generator's learned condition space and the discriminator's embedding space is minimal. Our approach achieves notable performance improvements without extensive parameter searches, demonstrating practical advantages for training discriminative models while effectively mitigating problems regarding collections of large datasets.

Abstract: Automation of analog topology design is crucial due to customized requirements of modern applications with heavily manual engineering efforts. The state-of-the-art work applies a sequence-to-sequence approach and supervised finetuning on language models to generate topologies given user specifications. However, its circuit formulation is inefficient due to O(|V |2) token length and suffers from low precision sensitivity to numeric inputs. In this work, we introduce LaMAGIC2, a succinct float-input canonical formulation with identifier (SFCI) for language model-based analog topology generation. SFCI addresses these challenges by improving component-type recognition through identifier-based representations, reducing token length complexity to O(|V |), and enhancing numeric precision sensitivity for better performance under tight tolerances. Our experiments demonstrate that LaMAGIC2 achieves 34% higher success rates under a tight tolerance of 0.01 and 10X lower MSEs compared to a prior method. LaMAGIC2 also exhibits better transferability for circuits with more vertices with up to 58.5% improvement. These advancements establish LaMAGIC2 as a robust framework for analog topology generation.

<title>Prompt Attacks Reveal Superficial Knowledge Removal in Unlearning Methods</title>

Abstract: In this work, we show that some machine unlearning methods may fail when subjected to straightforward prompt attacks. We systematically evaluate eight unlearning techniques across three model families, and employ output-based, logit-based, and probe analysis to determine to what extent supposedly unlearned knowledge can be retrieved. While methods like RMU and TAR demonstrate robust unlearning, ELM remains vulnerable to specific prompt attacks (e.g., Hindi filler text in original prompt recovering 57.3% accuracy). Our logit analysis also confirms that unlearned models are generally not hiding knowledge by modifying the way the answer is formatted, as the correlation between output and logit accuracy is strong. These results challenge prevailing assumptions about unlearning effectiveness and highlight the need for evaluation frameworks that can reliably distinguish between true knowledge removal and superficial output suppression. We also publicly make available our evaluation framework to easily evaluate prompting techniques to retrieve unlearning knowledge.

Abstract: We present ToxSyn-PT, the first large-scale Portuguese corpus that enables fine-grained hate-speech classification across nine legally protected minority groups. The dataset contains 53,274 synthetic sentences equally distributed between minorities groups and toxicity labels. ToxSyn-PT is created through a novel four-stage pipeline: (1) a compact, manually curated seed; (2) few-shot expansion with an instruction-tuned LLM; (3) paraphrase-based augmentation; and (4) enrichment, plus additional neutral texts to curb overfitting to group-specific cues. The resulting corpus is class-balanced, stylistically diverse, and free from the social-media domain that dominate existing Portuguese datasets. Despite domain differences with traditional benchmarks, experiments on both binary and multi-label classification on the corpus yields strong results across five public Portuguese hate-speech datasets, demonstrating robust generalization even across domain boundaries. The dataset is publicly released to advance research on synthetic data and hate-speech detection in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence holds significant potential to enhance human creativity. However, achieving this vision requires a clearer understanding of how such enhancement can be effectively realized. Adopting the perspective of distributed creativity, we identify three primary modes through which AI can contribute to creative processes: Support, where AI acts as a tool; Synergy, where AI and humans collaborate in complementary ways; and Symbiosis, where human and AI cognition become so integrated that they form a unified creative system. These modes are defined along two key dimensions: the level of technical autonomy exhibited by the AI system and the degree of perceived agency attributed to it. We examine how each configuration influences different levels of creativity - from everyday problem-solving to paradigm-shifting innovation - and discuss the theoretical, ethical, and design implications.

<title>Do Language Models Have Bayesian Brains? Distinguishing Stochastic and Deterministic Decision Patterns within Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Language models are essentially probability distributions over token sequences. Auto-regressive models generate sentences by iteratively computing and sampling from the distribution of the next token. This iterative sampling introduces stochasticity, leading to the assumption that language models make probabilistic decisions, similar to sampling from unknown distributions. Building on this assumption, prior research has used simulated Gibbs sampling, inspired by experiments designed to elicit human priors, to infer the priors of language models. In this paper, we revisit a critical question: Do language models possess Bayesian brains? Our findings show that under certain conditions, language models can exhibit near-deterministic decision-making, such as producing maximum likelihood estimations, even with a non-zero sampling temperature. This challenges the sampling assumption and undermines previous methods for eliciting human-like priors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that without proper scrutiny, a system with deterministic behavior undergoing simulated Gibbs sampling can converge to a "false prior." To address this, we propose a straightforward approach to distinguish between stochastic and deterministic decision patterns in Gibbs sampling, helping to prevent the inference of misleading language model priors. We experiment on a variety of large language models to identify their decision patterns under various circumstances. Our results provide key insights in understanding decision making of large language models.

Abstract: Discrete audio tokens are compact representations that aim to preserve perceptual quality, phonetic content, and speaker characteristics while enabling efficient storage and inference, as well as competitive performance across diverse downstream tasks.They provide a practical alternative to continuous features, enabling the integration of speech and audio into modern large language models (LLMs). As interest in token-based audio processing grows, various tokenization methods have emerged, and several surveys have reviewed the latest progress in the field. However, existing studies often focus on specific domains or tasks and lack a unified comparison across various benchmarks. This paper presents a systematic review and benchmark of discrete audio tokenizers, covering three domains: speech, music, and general audio. We propose a taxonomy of tokenization approaches based on encoder-decoder, quantization techniques, training paradigm, streamability, and application domains. We evaluate tokenizers on multiple benchmarks for reconstruction, downstream performance, and acoustic language modeling, and analyze trade-offs through controlled ablation studies. Our findings highlight key limitations, practical considerations, and open challenges, providing insight and guidance for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

Abstract: Gradient-based data influence approximation has been leveraged to select useful data samples in the supervised fine-tuning of large language models. However, the computation of gradients throughout the fine-tuning process requires too many resources to be feasible in practice. In this paper, we propose an efficient gradient-based data selection framework with clustering and a modified Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm. Based on the intuition that data samples with similar gradient features will have similar influences, we first perform clustering on the training data pool. Then, we frame the inter-cluster data selection as a constrained computing budget allocation problem and consider it a multi-armed bandit problem. A modified UCB algorithm is leveraged to solve this problem. Specifically, during the iterative sampling process, historical data influence information is recorded to directly estimate the distributions of each cluster, and a cold start is adopted to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on various benchmarks show that our proposed framework, ClusterUCB, can achieve comparable results to the original gradient-based data selection methods while greatly reducing computing consumption.

Abstract: Voice conversion has emerged as a pivotal technology in numerous applications ranging from assistive communication to entertainment. In this paper, we present RT-VC, a zero-shot real-time voice conversion system that delivers ultra-low latency and high-quality performance. Our approach leverages an articulatory feature space to naturally disentangle content and speaker characteristics, facilitating more robust and interpretable voice transformations. Additionally, the integration of differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP) enables efficient vocoding directly from articulatory features, significantly reducing conversion latency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that, while maintaining synthesis quality comparable to the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, RT-VC achieves a CPU latency of 61.4 ms, representing a 13.3\% reduction in latency.

Abstract: Training deep learning networks with minimal supervision has gained significant research attention due to its potential to reduce reliance on extensive labelled data. While self-training methods have proven effective in semi-supervised learning, they remain vulnerable to errors from noisy pseudo labels. Moreover, most recent approaches to the few-label classification problem are either designed for resource-rich languages such as English or involve complex cascading models that are prone to overfitting. To address the persistent challenge of few-label text classification in truly low-resource linguistic contexts, where existing methods often struggle with noisy pseudo-labels and domain adaptation, we propose Flick. Unlike prior methods that rely on generic multi-cluster pseudo-labelling or complex cascading architectures, Flick leverages the fundamental insight that distilling high-confidence pseudo-labels from a broader set of initial clusters can dramatically improve pseudo-label quality, particularly for linguistically diverse, low-resource settings. Flick introduces a novel pseudo-label refinement component, a departure from traditional pseudo-labelling strategies by identifying and leveraging top-performing pseudo-label clusters. This component specifically learns to distil highly reliable pseudo-labels from an initial broad set by focusing on single-cluster cohesion and leveraging an adaptive top-k selection mechanism. This targeted refinement process is crucial for mitigating the propagation of errors inherent in low-resource data, allowing for robust fine-tuning of pre-trained language models with only a handful of true labels. We demonstrate Flick's efficacy across 14 diverse datasets, encompassing challenging low-resource languages such as Arabic, Urdu, and Setswana, alongside English, showcasing its superior performance and adaptability.

Abstract: Test collections are crucial for evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems. Creating a diverse set of user queries for these collections can be challenging, and obtaining relevance judgments, which indicate how well retrieved documents match a query, is often costly and resource-intensive. Recently, generating synthetic datasets using Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention in various applications. While previous work has used LLMs to generate synthetic queries or documents to improve ranking models, using LLMs to create synthetic test collections is still relatively unexplored. Previous work~\cite{rahmani2024synthetic} showed that synthetic test collections have the potential to be used for system evaluation, however, more analysis is needed to validate this claim. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate the reliability of synthetic test collections constructed using LLMs, where LLMs are used to generate synthetic queries, labels, or both. In particular, we examine the potential biases that might occur when such test collections are used for evaluation. We first empirically show the presence of such bias in evaluation results and analyse the effects it might have on system evaluation. We further validate the presence of such bias using a linear mixed-effects model. Our analysis shows that while the effect of bias present in evaluation results obtained using synthetic test collections could be significant, for e.g.~computing absolute system performance, its effect may not be as significant in comparing relative system performance.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable skin cancer diagnosis is critical for early treatment and improved patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) models have shown promise in automating skin cancer classification, but their performance can be limited by data scarcity and a lack of uncertainty awareness. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of DL-based skin lesion classification using transfer learning and uncertainty quantification (UQ) on the HAM10000 dataset. In the first phase, we benchmarked several pre-trained feature extractors-including Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) variants, Residual Network-50 (ResNet50), Densely Connected Convolutional Network (DenseNet121), Visual Geometry Group network (VGG16), and EfficientNet-V2-Large-combined with a range of traditional classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and logistic regression. Our results show that CLIP-based vision transformers, particularly LAION CLIP ViT-H/14 with SVM, deliver the highest classification performance. In the second phase, we incorporated UQ using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Ensemble, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout (EMCD) to assess not only prediction accuracy but also the reliability of model outputs. We evaluated these models using uncertainty-aware metrics such as uncertainty accuracy(UAcc), uncertainty sensitivity(USen), uncertainty specificity(USpe), and uncertainty precision(UPre). The results demonstrate that ensemble methods offer a good trade-off between accuracy and uncertainty handling, while EMCD is more sensitive to uncertain predictions. This study highlights the importance of integrating UQ into DL-based medical diagnosis to enhance both performance and trustworthiness in real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) exhibits transformation symmetries, including spatial rotation symmetry within individual frames and temporal symmetry along the time dimension. Explicit incorporation of these symmetry priors in the reconstruction model can significantly improve image quality, especially under aggressive undersampling scenarios. Recently, Equivariant convolutional neural network (ECNN) has shown great promise in exploiting spatial symmetry priors. However, existing ECNNs critically fail to model temporal symmetry, arguably the most universal and informative structural prior in dynamic MRI reconstruction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Deep Unrolling Network with Spatiotemporal Rotation Equivariance (DUN-SRE) for Dynamic MRI Reconstruction. The DUN-SRE establishes spatiotemporal equivariance through a (2+1)D equivariant convolutional architecture. In particular, it integrates both the data consistency and proximal mapping module into a unified deep unrolling framework. This architecture ensures rigorous propagation of spatiotemporal rotation symmetry constraints throughout the reconstruction process, enabling more physically accurate modeling of cardiac motion dynamics in cine MRI. In addition, a high-fidelity group filter parameterization mechanism is developed to maintain representation precision while enforcing symmetry constraints. Comprehensive experiments on Cardiac CINE MRI datasets demonstrate that DUN-SRE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in preserving rotation-symmetric structures, offering strong generalization capability to a broad range of dynamic MRI reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Lane-topology prediction is a critical component of safe and reliable autonomous navigation. An accurate understanding of the road environment aids this task. We observe that this information often follows conventions encoded in natural language, through design codes that reflect the road structure and road names that capture the road functionality. We augment this information in a lightweight manner to SMERF, a map-prior-based online lane-topology prediction model, by combining structured road metadata from OSM maps and lane-width priors from Road design manuals with the road centerline encodings. We evaluate our method on two geo-diverse complex intersection scenarios. Our method shows improvement in both lane and traffic element detection and their association. We report results using four topology-aware metrics to comprehensively assess the model performance. These results demonstrate the ability of our approach to generalize and scale to diverse topologies and conditions.

Abstract: Skin carcinoma is the most prevalent form of cancer globally, accounting for over $8 billion in annual healthcare expenditures. In clinical settings, physicians document patient visits using detailed SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan) notes. However, manually generating these notes is labor-intensive and contributes to clinician burnout. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised multimodal framework to generate clinically structured SOAP notes from limited inputs, including lesion images and sparse clinical text. Our approach reduces reliance on manual annotations, enabling scalable, clinically grounded documentation while alleviating clinician burden and reducing the need for large annotated data. Our method achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o, Claude, and DeepSeek Janus Pro across key clinical relevance metrics. To evaluate clinical quality, we introduce two novel metrics MedConceptEval and Clinical Coherence Score (CCS) which assess semantic alignment with expert medical concepts and input features, respectively.

Abstract: This study examined code issue detection and revision automation by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o into software development workflows. A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.

Abstract: Students' academic emotions significantly influence their social behavior and learning performance. Traditional approaches to automatically and accurately analyze these emotions have predominantly relied on supervised machine learning algorithms. However, these models often struggle to generalize across different contexts, necessitating repeated cycles of data collection, annotation, and training. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers a promising alternative, enabling generalization across visual recognition tasks through zero-shot prompting without requiring fine-tuning. This study investigates the potential of VLMs to analyze students' academic emotions via facial expressions in an online learning environment. We employed two VLMs, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, to analyze 5,000 images depicting confused, distracted, happy, neutral, and tired expressions using zero-shot prompting. Preliminary results indicate that both models demonstrate moderate performance in academic facial expression recognition, with Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct outperforming Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. Notably, both models excel in identifying students' happy emotions but fail to detect distracted behavior. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct exhibits relatively high performance in recognizing students' confused expressions, highlighting its potential for practical applications in identifying content that causes student confusion.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors. Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Abstract: Faithful evaluation of language model capabilities is crucial for deriving actionable insights that can inform model development. However, rigorous causal evaluations in this domain face significant methodological challenges, including complex confounding effects and prohibitive computational costs associated with extensive retraining. To tackle these challenges, we propose a causal representation learning framework wherein observed benchmark performance is modeled as a linear transformation of a few latent capability factors. Crucially, these latent factors are identified as causally interrelated after appropriately controlling for the base model as a common confounder. Applying this approach to a comprehensive dataset encompassing over 1500 models evaluated across six benchmarks from the Open LLM Leaderboard, we identify a concise three-node linear causal structure that reliably explains the observed performance variations. Further interpretation of this causal structure provides substantial scientific insights beyond simple numerical rankings: specifically, we reveal a clear causal direction starting from general problem-solving capabilities, advancing through instruction-following proficiency, and culminating in mathematical reasoning ability. Our results underscore the essential role of carefully controlling base model variations during evaluation, a step critical to accurately uncovering the underlying causal relationships among latent model capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled multimodal foundation models to tackle both image understanding and generation within a unified framework. Despite these gains, unified models often underperform compared to specialized models in either task. A key challenge in developing unified models lies in the inherent differences between the visual features needed for image understanding versus generation, as well as the distinct training processes required for each modality. In this work, we introduce Pisces, an auto-regressive multimodal foundation model that addresses this challenge through a novel decoupled visual encoding architecture and tailored training techniques optimized for multimodal generation. Combined with meticulous data curation, pretraining, and finetuning, Pisces achieves competitive performance in both image understanding and image generation. We evaluate Pisces on over 20 public benchmarks for image understanding, where it demonstrates strong performance across a wide range of tasks. Additionally, on GenEval, a widely adopted benchmark for image generation, Pisces exhibits robust generative capabilities. Our extensive analysis reveals the synergistic relationship between image understanding and generation, and the benefits of using separate visual encoders, advancing the field of unified multimodal models.

Abstract: The rapid growth of deep learning has driven exponential increases in model parameters and computational demands. NVIDIA GPUs and their CUDA-based software ecosystem provide robust support for parallel computing, significantly alleviating computational bottlenecks. Meanwhile, due to the cultivation of user programming habits and the high performance of GPUs, the CUDA ecosystem has established a dominant position in the field of parallel software. This dominance requires other hardware platforms to support CUDA-based software with performance portability. However, translating CUDA code to other platforms poses significant challenges due to differences in parallel programming paradigms and hardware architectures. Existing approaches rely on language extensions, domain-specific languages (DSLs), or compilers but face limitations in workload coverage and generalizability. Moreover, these methods often incur substantial development costs. Recently, LLMs have demonstrated extraordinary potential in various vertical domains, especially in code-related tasks. However, the performance of existing LLMs in CUDA transpilation, particularly for high-performance code, remains suboptimal. The main reason for this limitation lies in the lack of high-quality training datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for generating high-performance CUDA and corresponding platform code pairs, leveraging AI compiler and automatic optimization technology. We further enhance the framework with a graph-based data augmentation method and introduce HPCTransEval, a benchmark for evaluating LLM performance on CUDA transpilation. We conduct experiments using CUDA-to-CPU transpilation as a case study on leading LLMs. The result demonstrates that our framework significantly improves CUDA transpilation, highlighting the potential of LLMs to address compatibility challenges within the CUDA ecosystem.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted. Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83% and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet they still struggle to reliably verify the correctness of their own outputs. Existing solutions to this verification challenge often depend on separate verifier models or require multi-stage self-correction training pipelines, which limit scalability. In this paper, we propose Policy as Generative Verifier (PAG), a simple and effective framework that empowers LLMs to self-correct by alternating between policy and verifier roles within a unified multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. Distinct from prior approaches that always generate a second attempt regardless of model confidence, PAG introduces a selective revision mechanism: the model revises its answer only when its own generative verification step detects an error. This verify-then-revise workflow not only alleviates model collapse but also jointly enhances both reasoning and verification abilities. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning benchmarks highlight PAG's dual advancements: as a policy, it enhances direct generation and self-correction accuracy; as a verifier, its self-verification outperforms self-consistency.

This paper proposes a domain-based convolutional product (CP). Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is considered.

Abstract: Time series data in real-world applications such as healthcare, climate modeling, and finance are often irregular, multimodal, and messy, with varying sampling rates, asynchronous modalities, and pervasive missingness. However, existing benchmarks typically assume clean, regularly sampled, unimodal data, creating a significant gap between research and real-world deployment. We introduce Time-IMM, a dataset specifically designed to capture cause-driven irregularity in multimodal multivariate time series. Time-IMM represents nine distinct types of time series irregularity, categorized into trigger-based, constraint-based, and artifact-based mechanisms. Complementing the dataset, we introduce IMM-TSF, a benchmark library for forecasting on irregular multimodal time series, enabling asynchronous integration and realistic evaluation. IMM-TSF includes specialized fusion modules, including a timestamp-to-text fusion module and a multimodality fusion module, which support both recency-aware averaging and attention-based integration strategies. Empirical results demonstrate that explicitly modeling multimodality on irregular time series data leads to substantial gains in forecasting performance. Time-IMM and IMM-TSF provide a foundation for advancing time series analysis under real-world conditions. The dataset is publicly available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blacksnail789521/time-imm/data, and the benchmark library can be accessed at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IMMTSF_NeurIPS2025.

Abstract: The integration of audio perception capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled significant advances in Audio-LLMs. Although application-focused developments, particularly in curating training data for specific capabilities e.g., audio reasoning, have progressed rapidly, the underlying mechanisms that govern efficient transfer of rich semantic representations from audio encoders to LLMs remain under-explored. We conceptualize effective audio-LLM interaction as the LLM's ability to proficiently probe the audio encoder representations to satisfy textual queries. This paper presents a systematic investigation on how architectural design choices can affect that. Beginning with a standard Pengi/LLaVA-style audio-LLM architecture, we propose and evaluate several modifications guided by hypotheses derived from mechanistic interpretability studies and LLM operational principles. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) delaying audio integration until the LLM's initial layers establish textual context that enhances its ability to probe the audio representations for relevant information; (2) the LLM can proficiently probe audio representations exclusively through LLM layer's attention submodule, without requiring propagation to its Feed-Forward Network (FFN) submodule; (3) an efficiently integrated ensemble of diverse audio encoders provides richer, complementary representations, thereby broadening the LLM's capacity to probe a wider spectrum of audio information. All hypotheses are evaluated using an identical three-stage training curriculum on a dataset of 5.6 million audio-text pairs, ensuring controlled comparisons. Our final architecture, which incorporates all proposed modifications, achieves relative improvements from 10\% to 60\% over the baseline, validating our approach to optimizing cross-modal information transfer in audio-LLMs. Project page: https://ta012.github.io/PAL/

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and are widely adopted for diverse applications. However, fine-tuning these models often involves private or sensitive information, raising critical privacy concerns. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive study evaluating the vulnerability of fine-tuned LLMs to membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our empirical analysis demonstrates that MIAs exploit the loss reduction during fine-tuning, making them highly effective in revealing membership information. These findings motivate the development of our defense. We propose SOFT (\textbf{S}elective data \textbf{O}bfuscation in LLM \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning), a novel defense technique that mitigates privacy leakage by leveraging influential data selection with an adjustable parameter to balance utility preservation and privacy protection. Our extensive experiments span six diverse domains and multiple LLM architectures and scales. Results show that SOFT effectively reduces privacy risks while maintaining competitive model performance, offering a practical and scalable solution to safeguard sensitive information in fine-tuned LLMs.

Abstract: We consider strategy proof mechanisms for facility location which maximize equitability between agents. As is common in the literature, we measure equitability with the Gini index. We first prove a simple but fundamental impossibility result that no strategy proof mechanism can bound the approximation ratio of the optimal Gini index of utilities for one or more facilities. We propose instead computing approximation ratios of the complemented Gini index of utilities, and consider how well both deterministic and randomized mechanisms approximate this. In addition, as Nash welfare is often put forwards as an equitable compromise between egalitarian and utilitarian outcomes, we consider how well mechanisms approximate the Nash welfare.

Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) quantization for fast, efficient inference has been an important tool in limiting the cost of machine learning (ML) model inference. Quantization-specific model development techniques such as regularization, quantization-aware training, and quantization-robustness penalties have served to greatly boost the accuracy and robustness of modern DNNs. However, very little exploration has been done on improving the initial conditions of DNN training for quantization. Just as random weight initialization has been shown to significantly impact test accuracy of floating point models, it would make sense that different weight initialization methods impact quantization robustness of trained models. We present an extensive study examining the effects of different weight initializations on a variety of CNN building blocks commonly used in efficient CNNs. This analysis reveals that even with varying CNN architectures, the choice of random weight initializer can significantly affect final quantization robustness. Next, we explore a new method for quantization-robust CNN initialization -- using Graph Hypernetworks (GHN) to predict parameters of quantized DNNs. Besides showing that GHN-predicted parameters are quantization-robust after regular float32 pretraining (of the GHN), we find that finetuning GHNs to predict parameters for quantized graphs (which we call GHN-QAT) can further improve quantized accuracy of CNNs. Notably, GHN-QAT shows significant accuracy improvements for even 4-bit quantization and better-than-random accuracy for 2-bits. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on quantization-aware DNN weight initialization. GHN-QAT offers a novel approach to quantized DNN model design. Future investigations, such as using GHN-QAT-initialized parameters for quantization-aware training, can further streamline the DNN quantization process.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, e.g., through reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. For applying these models in specific domains beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent approaches can be utilized that solve complex tasks by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution. Applications might utilize these capabilities and the knowledge of specialized LLM agents. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application is not explored well. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and their suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research to specify and evaluate these aspects through a multi-agent system. The system architecture and prototype are extended from previous research and a specification is introduced for multi-agent systems. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. In particular, the results show the evaluation of question answering, server security, and network security tasks that were completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

Abstract: The Reference Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) task generates segmentation masks for specified objects in images based on textual descriptions, which has attracted widespread attention and research interest. Current RRSIS methods rely on multi-modal fusion backbones and semantic segmentation heads but face challenges like dense annotation requirements and complex scene interpretation. To address these issues, we propose a framework named \textit{prompt-generated semantic localization guiding Segment Anything Model}(PSLG-SAM), which decomposes the RRSIS task into two stages: coarse localization and fine segmentation. In coarse localization stage, a visual grounding network roughly locates the text-described object. In fine segmentation stage, the coordinates from the first stage guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM), enhanced by a clustering-based foreground point generator and a mask boundary iterative optimization strategy for precise segmentation. Notably, the second stage can be train-free, significantly reducing the annotation data burden for the RRSIS task. Additionally, decomposing the RRSIS task into two stages allows for focusing on specific region segmentation, avoiding interference from complex scenes.We further contribute a high-quality, multi-category manually annotated dataset. Experimental validation on two datasets (RRSIS-D and RRSIS-M) demonstrates that PSLG-SAM achieves significant performance improvements and surpasses existing state-of-the-art models.Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot dialogue state tracking (DST), reducing the need for task-specific training. However, conventional DST benchmarks primarily focus on structured user-agent conversations, failing to capture the complexities of real-world multi-user interactions. In this study, we assess the robustness of LLMs in multi-user DST while minimizing dataset construction costs. Inspired by recent advances in LLM-based data annotation, we extend an existing DST dataset by generating utterances of a second user based on speech act theory. Our methodology systematically incorporates a second user's utterances into conversations, enabling a controlled evaluation of LLMs in multi-user settings. Experimental results reveal a significant performance drop compared to single-user DST, highlighting the limitations of current LLMs in extracting and tracking dialogue states amidst multiple speakers. Our findings emphasize the need for future research to enhance LLMs for multi-user DST scenarios, paving the way for more realistic and robust DST models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to a lack of background knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. To address these limitations, integrating knowledge graphs (KGs) with LLMs has been intensively studied. Existing KG-enhanced LLMs focus on supplementary factual knowledge, but still struggle with solving complex questions. We argue that refining the relationships among facts and organizing them into a logically consistent reasoning path is equally important as factual knowledge itself. Despite their potential, extracting reliable reasoning paths from KGs poses the following challenges: the complexity of graph structures and the existence of multiple generated paths, making it difficult to distinguish between useful and redundant ones. To tackle these challenges, we propose the RRP framework to mine the knowledge graph, which combines the semantic strengths of LLMs with structural information obtained through relation embedding and bidirectional distribution learning. Additionally, we introduce a rethinking module that evaluates and refines reasoning paths according to their significance. Experimental results on two public datasets show that RRP achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods. Moreover, RRP can be easily integrated into various LLMs to enhance their reasoning abilities in a plug-and-play manner. By generating high-quality reasoning paths tailored to specific questions, RRP distills effective guidance for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Video Large Language Models (Vid-LLMs) improving multimodal understanding, challenges persist in streaming video reasoning due to its reliance on contextual information. Existing paradigms feed all available historical contextual information into Vid-LLMs, resulting in a significant computational burden for visual data processing. Furthermore, the inclusion of irrelevant context distracts models from key details. This paper introduces a challenging task called Context-guided Streaming Video Reasoning (CogStream), which simulates real-world streaming video scenarios, requiring models to identify the most relevant historical contextual information to deduce answers for questions about the current stream. To support CogStream, we present a densely annotated dataset featuring extensive and hierarchical question-answer pairs, generated by a semi-automatic pipeline. Additionally, we present CogReasoner as a baseline model. It efficiently tackles this task by leveraging visual stream compression and historical dialogue retrieval. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. Code will be released soon.

Abstract: Interactive theorem provers (ITPs) are powerful tools for the formal verification of mathematical proofs down to the axiom level. However, their lack of a natural language interface remains a significant limitation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the understanding of natural language inputs, paving the way for autoformalization - the process of translating natural language proofs into formal proofs that can be verified. Despite these advancements, existing autoformalization approaches are limited to verifying complete proofs and lack the capability for finer, sentence-level verification. To address this gap, we propose StepProof, a novel autoformalization method designed for granular, step-by-step verification. StepProof breaks down complete proofs into multiple verifiable subproofs, enabling sentence-level verification. Experimental results demonstrate that StepProof significantly improves proof success rates and efficiency compared to traditional methods. Additionally, we found that minor manual adjustments to the natural language proofs, tailoring them for step-level verification, further enhanced StepProof's performance in autoformalization.

Abstract: Explaining why the species lives at a particular location is important for understanding ecological systems and conserving biodiversity. However, existing ecological workflows are fragmented and often inaccessible to non-specialists. We propose an end-to-end visual-to-causal framework that transforms a species image into interpretable causal insights about its habitat preference. The system integrates species recognition, global occurrence retrieval, pseudo-absence sampling, and climate data extraction. We then discover causal structures among environmental features and estimate their influence on species occurrence using modern causal inference methods. Finally, we generate statistically grounded, human-readable causal explanations from structured templates and large language models. We demonstrate the framework on a bee and a flower species and report early results as part of an ongoing project, showing the potential of the multimodal AI assistant backed up by a recommended ecological modeling practice for describing species habitat in human-understandable language.

Abstract: Demographic bias in high-performance face recognition (FR) systems often eludes detection by existing metrics, especially with respect to subtle disparities in the tails of the score distribution. We introduce the Comprehensive Equity Index (CEI), a novel metric designed to address this limitation. CEI uniquely analyzes genuine and impostor score distributions separately, enabling a configurable focus on tail probabilities while also considering overall distribution shapes. Our extensive experiments (evaluating state-of-the-art FR systems, intentionally biased models, and diverse datasets) confirm CEI's superior ability to detect nuanced biases where previous methods fall short. Furthermore, we present CEI^A, an automated version of the metric that enhances objectivity and simplifies practical application. CEI provides a robust and sensitive tool for operational FR fairness assessment. The proposed methods have been developed particularly for bias evaluation in face biometrics but, in general, they are applicable for comparing statistical distributions in any problem where one is interested in analyzing the distribution tails.

Abstract: In e-commerce and digital marketing, generating high-fidelity human-product demonstration videos is important for effective product presentation. However, most existing frameworks either fail to preserve the identities of both humans and products or lack an understanding of human-product spatial relationships, leading to unrealistic representations and unnatural interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework. Our method simultaneously preserves human identities and product-specific details, such as logos and textures, by injecting paired human-product reference information and utilizing an additional masked cross-attention mechanism. We employ a 3D body mesh template and product bounding boxes to provide precise motion guidance, enabling intuitive alignment of hand gestures with product placements. Additionally, structured text encoding is used to incorporate category-level semantics, enhancing 3D consistency during small rotational changes across frames. Trained on a hybrid dataset with extensive data augmentation strategies, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in maintaining the identity integrity of both humans and products and generating realistic demonstration motions.

<title>Size-adaptive Hypothesis Testing for Fairness</title>

Abstract: Determining whether an algorithmic decision-making system discriminates against a specific demographic typically involves comparing a single point estimate of a fairness metric against a predefined threshold. This practice is statistically brittle: it ignores sampling error and treats small demographic subgroups the same as large ones. The problem intensifies in intersectional analyses, where multiple sensitive attributes are considered jointly, giving rise to a larger number of smaller groups. As these groups become more granular, the data representing them becomes too sparse for reliable estimation, and fairness metrics yield excessively wide confidence intervals, precluding meaningful conclusions about potential unfair treatments.
  In this paper, we introduce a unified, size-adaptive, hypothesis-testing framework that turns fairness assessment into an evidence-based statistical decision. Our contribution is twofold. (i) For sufficiently large subgroups, we prove a Central-Limit result for the statistical parity difference, leading to analytic confidence intervals and a Wald test whose type-I (false positive) error is guaranteed at level $\alpha$. (ii) For the long tail of small intersectional groups, we derive a fully Bayesian Dirichlet-multinomial estimator; Monte-Carlo credible intervals are calibrated for any sample size and naturally converge to Wald intervals as more data becomes available. We validate our approach empirically on benchmark datasets, demonstrating how our tests provide interpretable, statistically rigorous decisions under varying degrees of data availability and intersectionality.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, but their deployment has exposed critical vulnerabilities, particularly to jailbreak attacks that circumvent safety mechanisms. Guardrails--external defense mechanisms that monitor and control LLM interaction--have emerged as a promising solution. However, the current landscape of LLM guardrails is fragmented, lacking a unified taxonomy and comprehensive evaluation framework. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we present the first holistic analysis of jailbreak guardrails for LLMs. We propose a novel, multi-dimensional taxonomy that categorizes guardrails along six key dimensions, and introduce a Security-Efficiency-Utility evaluation framework to assess their practical effectiveness. Through extensive analysis and experiments, we identify the strengths and limitations of existing guardrail approaches, explore their universality across attack types, and provide insights into optimizing defense combinations. Our work offers a structured foundation for future research and development, aiming to guide the principled advancement and deployment of robust LLM guardrails.

<title>TexTailor: Customized Text-aligned Texturing via Effective Resampling</title>

Abstract: We present TexTailor, a novel method for generating consistent object textures from textual descriptions. Existing text-to-texture synthesis approaches utilize depth-aware diffusion models to progressively generate images and synthesize textures across predefined multiple viewpoints. However, these approaches lead to a gradual shift in texture properties across viewpoints due to (1) insufficient integration of previously synthesized textures at each viewpoint during the diffusion process and (2) the autoregressive nature of the texture synthesis process. Moreover, the predefined selection of camera positions, which does not account for the object's geometry, limits the effective use of texture information synthesized from different viewpoints, ultimately degrading overall texture consistency. In TexTailor, we address these issues by (1) applying a resampling scheme that repeatedly integrates information from previously synthesized textures within the diffusion process, and (2) fine-tuning a depth-aware diffusion model on these resampled textures. During this process, we observed that using only a few training images restricts the model's original ability to generate high-fidelity images aligned with the conditioning, and therefore propose an performance preservation loss to mitigate this issue. Additionally, we improve the synthesis of view-consistent textures by adaptively adjusting camera positions based on the object's geometry. Experiments on a subset of the Objaverse dataset and the ShapeNet car dataset demonstrate that TexTailor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing view-consistent textures.

<title>Deep Learning-Based Digitization of Overlapping ECG Images with Open-Source Python Code</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10617</link>

Abstract: This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.

Abstract: This paper presents our system for Track 1: Mistake Identification in the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors. The task involves evaluating whether a tutor's response correctly identifies a mistake in a student's mathematical reasoning. We explore four approaches: (1) an ensemble of machine learning models over pooled token embeddings from multiple pretrained language models (LMs); (2) a frozen sentence-transformer using [CLS] embeddings with an MLP classifier; (3) a history-aware model with multi-head attention between token-level history and response embeddings; and (4) a retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting system with a large language model (LLM) i.e. GPT 4o. Our final system retrieves semantically similar examples, constructs structured prompts, and uses schema-guided output parsing to produce interpretable predictions. It outperforms all baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining example-driven prompting with LLM reasoning for pedagogical feedback assessment.

Abstract: Unsupervised reinforcement learning (URL) aims to learn general skills for unseen downstream tasks. Mutual Information Skill Learning (MISL) addresses URL by maximizing the mutual information between states and skills but lacks sufficient theoretical analysis, e.g., how well its learned skills can initialize a downstream task's policy. Our new theoretical analysis in this paper shows that the diversity and separability of learned skills are fundamentally critical to downstream task adaptation but MISL does not necessarily guarantee these properties. To complement MISL, we propose a novel disentanglement metric LSEPIN. Moreover, we build an information-geometric connection between LSEPIN and downstream task adaptation cost. For better geometric properties, we investigate a new strategy that replaces the KL divergence in information geometry with Wasserstein distance. We extend the geometric analysis to it, which leads to a novel skill-learning objective WSEP. It is theoretically justified to be helpful to downstream task adaptation and it is capable of discovering more initial policies for downstream tasks than MISL. We finally propose another Wasserstein distance-based algorithm PWSEP that can theoretically discover all optimal initial policies.

<title>Time Series Forecasting as Reasoning: A Slow-Thinking Approach with Reinforced LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.10630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To advance time series forecasting (TSF), various methods have been proposed to improve prediction accuracy, evolving from statistical techniques to data-driven deep learning architectures. Despite their effectiveness, most existing methods still adhere to a fast thinking paradigm-relying on extracting historical patterns and mapping them to future values as their core modeling philosophy, lacking an explicit thinking process that incorporates intermediate time series reasoning. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., OpenAI-o1) have shown remarkable multi-step reasoning capabilities, offering an alternative way to overcome these issues. However, prompt engineering alone presents several limitations - including high computational cost, privacy risks, and limited capacity for in-depth domain-specific time series reasoning. To address these limitations, a more promising approach is to train LLMs to develop slow thinking capabilities and acquire strong time series reasoning skills. For this purpose, we propose Time-R1, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to enhance multi-step reasoning ability of LLMs for time series forecasting. Specifically, the first stage conducts supervised fine-tuning for warmup adaptation, while the second stage employs reinforcement learning to improve the model's generalization ability. Particularly, we design a fine-grained multi-objective reward specifically for time series forecasting, and then introduce GRIP (group-based relative importance for policy optimization), which leverages non-uniform sampling to further encourage and optimize the model's exploration of effective reasoning paths. Experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 significantly improves forecast performance across diverse datasets.

<title>Symmetrical Flow Matching: Unified Image Generation, Segmentation, and Classification with Score-Based Generative Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.10634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow Matching has emerged as a powerful framework for learning continuous transformations between distributions, enabling high-fidelity generative modeling. This work introduces Symmetrical Flow Matching (SymmFlow), a new formulation that unifies semantic segmentation, classification, and image generation within a single model. Using a symmetric learning objective, SymmFlow models forward and reverse transformations jointly, ensuring bi-directional consistency, while preserving sufficient entropy for generative diversity. A new training objective is introduced to explicitly retain semantic information across flows, featuring efficient sampling while preserving semantic structure, allowing for one-step segmentation and classification without iterative refinement. Unlike previous approaches that impose strict one-to-one mapping between masks and images, SymmFlow generalizes to flexible conditioning, supporting both pixel-level and image-level class labels. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that SymmFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic image synthesis, obtaining FID scores of 11.9 on CelebAMask-HQ and 7.0 on COCO-Stuff with only 25 inference steps. Additionally, it delivers competitive results on semantic segmentation and shows promising capabilities in classification tasks. The code will be publicly available.

<title>Data Shifts Hurt CoT: A Theoretical Study</title>

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) has been applied to various large language models (LLMs) and proven to be effective in improving the quality of outputs. In recent studies, transformers are proven to have absolute upper bounds in terms of expressive power, and consequently, they cannot solve many computationally difficult problems. However, empowered by CoT, transformers are proven to be able to solve some difficult problems effectively, such as the $k$-parity problem. Nevertheless, those works rely on two imperative assumptions: (1) identical training and testing distribution, and (2) corruption-free training data with correct reasoning steps. However, in the real world, these assumptions do not always hold. Although the risks of data shifts have caught attention, our work is the first to rigorously study the exact harm caused by such shifts to the best of our knowledge. Focusing on the $k$-parity problem, in this work we investigate the joint impact of two types of data shifts: the distribution shifts and data poisoning, on the quality of trained models obtained by a well-established CoT decomposition. In addition to revealing a surprising phenomenon that CoT leads to worse performance on learning parity than directly generating the prediction, our technical results also give a rigorous and comprehensive explanation of the mechanistic reasons of such impact.

<title>Contrastive Matrix Completion with Denoising and Augmented Graph Views for Robust Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Matrix completion is a widely adopted framework in recommender systems, as predicting the missing entries in the user-item rating matrix enables a comprehensive understanding of user preferences. However, current graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches are highly sensitive to noisy or irrelevant edges--due to their inherent message-passing mechanisms--and are prone to overfitting, which limits their generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method called Matrix Completion using Contrastive Learning (MCCL). Our approach begins by extracting local neighborhood subgraphs for each interaction and subsequently generates two distinct graph representations. The first representation emphasizes denoising by integrating GNN layers with an attention mechanism, while the second is obtained via a graph variational autoencoder that aligns the feature distribution with a standard prior. A mutual learning loss function is employed during training to gradually harmonize these representations, enabling the model to capture common patterns and significantly enhance its generalizability. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach not only improves the numerical accuracy of the predicted scores--achieving up to a 0.8% improvement in RMSE--but also produces superior rankings with improvements of up to 36% in ranking metrics.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Prototype-based methods improve interpretability by learning fine-grained part-prototypes; however, their visualization in the input pixel space is not always consistent with human-understandable biomarkers. In addition, well-known prototype-based approaches typically learn extremely granular prototypes that are less interpretable in medical imaging, where both the presence and extent of biomarkers and lesions are critical.
  Methods: To address these challenges, we propose PiPViT (Patch-based Visual Interpretable Prototypes), an inherently interpretable prototypical model for image recognition. Leveraging a vision transformer (ViT), PiPViT captures long-range dependencies among patches to learn robust, human-interpretable prototypes that approximate lesion extent only using image-level labels. Additionally, PiPViT benefits from contrastive learning and multi-resolution input processing, which enables effective localization of biomarkers across scales.
  Results: We evaluated PiPViT on retinal OCT image classification across four datasets, where it achieved competitive quantitative performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while delivering more meaningful explanations. Moreover, quantitative evaluation on a hold-out test set confirms that the learned prototypes are semantically and clinically relevant. We believe PiPViT can transparently explain its decisions and assist clinicians in understanding diagnostic outcomes. Github page: https://github.com/marziehoghbaie/PiPViT

Abstract: Continual learning poses a fundamental challenge for neural systems, which often suffer from catastrophic forgetting when exposed to sequential tasks. Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), despite their interpretability and efficiency, are not immune to this issue. In this paper, we introduce Saturation Self-Organizing Maps (SatSOM)-an extension of SOMs designed to improve knowledge retention in continual learning scenarios. SatSOM incorporates a novel saturation mechanism that gradually reduces the learning rate and neighborhood radius of neurons as they accumulate information. This effectively freezes well-trained neurons and redirects learning to underutilized areas of the map.

Abstract: Detecting life-threatening language is essential for safeguarding individuals in distress, promoting mental health and well-being, and preventing potential harm and loss of life. This paper presents an effective approach to identifying life-threatening texts using large language models (LLMs) and compares them with traditional methods such as bag of words, word embedding, topic modeling, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. We fine-tune three open-source LLMs including Gemma, Mistral, and Llama-2 using their 7B parameter variants on different datasets, which are constructed with class balance, imbalance, and extreme imbalance scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate a strong performance of LLMs against traditional methods. More specifically, Mistral and Llama-2 models are top performers in both balanced and imbalanced data scenarios while Gemma is slightly behind. We employ the upsampling technique to deal with the imbalanced data scenarios and demonstrate that while this method benefits traditional approaches, it does not have as much impact on LLMs. This study demonstrates a great potential of LLMs for real-world life-threatening language detection problems.

Abstract: Tabular in-context learning (ICL) has recently achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on several tabular prediction tasks. Previously restricted to classification problems on small tables, recent advances such as TabPFN and TabICL have extended its use to larger datasets. While being architecturally efficient and well-adapted to tabular data structures, current table-native ICL architectures, being trained exclusively on synthetic data, do not fully leverage the rich semantics and world knowledge contained in real-world tabular data. On another end of this spectrum, tabular ICL models based on pretrained large language models such as TabuLa-8B integrate deep semantic understanding and world knowledge but are only able to make use of a small amount of context due to inherent architectural limitations. With the aim to combine the best of both these worlds, we introduce ConTextTab, integrating semantic understanding and alignment into a table-native ICL framework. By employing specialized embeddings for different data modalities and by training on large-scale real-world tabular data, our model is competitive with SOTA across a broad set of benchmarks while setting a new standard on the semantically rich CARTE benchmark.

Abstract: Continual learning has traditionally focused on classifying either instances or classes, but real-world applications, such as robotics and self-driving cars, require models to handle both simultaneously. To mirror real-life scenarios, we introduce the task of continual learning of instances and classes, at the same time. This task challenges models to adapt to multiple levels of granularity over time, which requires balancing fine-grained instance recognition with coarse-grained class generalization. In this paper, we identify that classes and instances naturally form a hierarchical structure. To model these hierarchical relationships, we propose HyperCLIC, a continual learning algorithm that leverages hyperbolic space, which is uniquely suited for hierarchical data due to its ability to represent tree-like structures with low distortion and compact embeddings. Our framework incorporates hyperbolic classification and distillation objectives, enabling the continual embedding of hierarchical relations. To evaluate performance across multiple granularities, we introduce continual hierarchical metrics. We validate our approach on EgoObjects, the only dataset that captures the complexity of hierarchical object recognition in dynamic real-world environments. Empirical results show that HyperCLIC operates effectively at multiple granularities with improved hierarchical generalization.

Abstract: Quality management in semiconductor manufacturing often relies on template matching with known golden standards. For Indium-Phosphide (InP) multi-project wafer manufacturing, low production scale and high design variability lead to such golden standards being typically unavailable. Defect detection, in turn, is manual and labor-intensive. This work addresses this challenge by proposing a methodology to generate a synthetic golden standard using Deep Neural Networks, trained to simulate photo-realistic InP wafer images from CAD data. We evaluate various training objectives and assess the quality of the simulated images on both synthetic data and InP wafer photographs. Our deep-learning-based method outperforms a baseline decision-tree-based approach, enabling the use of a 'simulated golden die' from CAD plans in any user-defined region of a wafer for more efficient defect detection. We apply our method to a template matching procedure, to demonstrate its practical utility in surface defect detection.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI o1 achieve strong performance on mathematical benchmarks using lengthy chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, but the resulting traces are often unnecessarily verbose. This inflates token usage and cost, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or API-constrained settings. We introduce PREMISE (PRompt-based Efficient Mathematical Inference with Strategic Evaluation), a prompt-only framework that reduces reasoning overhead without modifying model weights. PREMISE combines trace-level diagnostics with gradient-inspired prompt optimization to minimize redundant computation while preserving answer accuracy. The approach jointly optimizes brevity and correctness through a multi-objective textual search that balances token length and answer validity. Unlike prior work, PREMISE runs in a single-pass black-box interface, so it can be applied directly to commercial LLMs. On GSM8K, SVAMP, and Math500 we match or exceed baseline accuracy ($96\%\rightarrow96\%$ with Claude, $91\%\rightarrow92\%$ with Gemini) while reducing reasoning tokens by up to $87.5\%$ and cutting dollar cost by $69$--$82\%$. These results show that prompt-level optimization is a practical and scalable path to efficient LRM inference without compromising reasoning quality.

<title>TED-LaST: Towards Robust Backdoor Defense Against Adaptive Attacks</title>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers implant hidden triggers during training to maliciously control model behavior. Topological Evolution Dynamics (TED) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for detecting backdoor attacks in DNNs. However, TED can be vulnerable to backdoor attacks that adaptively distort topological representation distributions across network layers. To address this limitation, we propose TED-LaST (Topological Evolution Dynamics against Laundry, Slow release, and Target mapping attack strategies), a novel defense strategy that enhances TED's robustness against adaptive attacks. TED-LaST introduces two key innovations: label-supervised dynamics tracking and adaptive layer emphasis. These enhancements enable the identification of stealthy threats that evade traditional TED-based defenses, even in cases of inseparability in topological space and subtle topological perturbations. We review and classify data poisoning tricks in state-of-the-art adaptive attacks and propose enhanced adaptive attack with target mapping, which can dynamically shift malicious tasks and fully leverage the stealthiness that adaptive attacks possess. Our comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets (CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and ImageNet100) and model architectures (ResNet20, ResNet101) show that TED-LaST effectively counteracts sophisticated backdoors like Adap-Blend, Adapt-Patch, and the proposed enhanced adaptive attack. TED-LaST sets a new benchmark for robust backdoor detection, substantially enhancing DNN security against evolving threats.

<title>BNMusic: Blending Environmental Noises into Personalized Music</title>

Abstract: While being disturbed by environmental noises, the acoustic masking technique is a conventional way to reduce the annoyance in audio engineering that seeks to cover up the noises with other dominant yet less intrusive sounds. However, misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work, we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is a long-standing challenge in autonomous robotics, aiming to empower agents with the ability to follow human instructions while navigating complex environments. Two key bottlenecks remain in this field: generalization to out-of-distribution environments and reliance on fixed discrete action spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Language Fly (VLFly), a framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to execute language-guided flight. Without the requirement for localization or active ranging sensors, VLFly outputs continuous velocity commands purely from egocentric observations captured by an onboard monocular camera. The VLFly integrates three modules: an instruction encoder based on a large language model (LLM) that reformulates high-level language into structured prompts, a goal retriever powered by a vision-language model (VLM) that matches these prompts to goal images via vision-language similarity, and a waypoint planner that generates executable trajectories for real-time UAV control. VLFly is evaluated across diverse simulation environments without additional fine-tuning and consistently outperforms all baselines. Moreover, real-world VLN tasks in indoor and outdoor environments under direct and indirect instructions demonstrate that VLFly achieves robust open-vocabulary goal understanding and generalized navigation capabilities, even in the presence of abstract language input.

Abstract: This study investigates how dynamical systems may be learned and modelled with a neuromorphic network which is itself a dynamical system. The neuromorphic network used in this study is based on a complex electrical circuit comprised of memristive elements that produce neuro-synaptic nonlinear responses to input electrical signals. To determine how computation may be performed using the physics of the underlying system, the neuromorphic network was simulated and evaluated on autonomous prediction of a multivariate chaotic time series, implemented with a reservoir computing framework. Through manipulating only input electrodes and voltages, optimal nonlinear dynamical responses were found when input voltages maximise the number of memristive components whose internal dynamics explore the entire dynamical range of the memristor model. Increasing the network coverage with the input electrodes was found to suppress other nonlinear responses that are less conducive to learning. These results provide valuable insights into how a practical neuromorphic network device can be optimised for learning complex dynamical systems using only external control parameters.

<title>Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier: Image Super-Resolution at Arbitrary Ultra-Large Scales</title>

Abstract: Prior Arbitrary-Scale Image Super-Resolution (ASISR) methods often experience a significant performance decline when the upsampling factor exceeds the range covered by the training data, introducing substantial blurring. To address this issue, we propose a unified model, Stroke-based Cyclic Amplifier (SbCA), for ultra-large upsampling tasks. The key of SbCA is the stroke vector amplifier, which decomposes the image into a series of strokes represented as vector graphics for magnification. Then, the detail completion module also restores missing details, ensuring high-fidelity image reconstruction. Our cyclic strategy achieves ultra-large upsampling by iteratively refining details with this unified SbCA model, trained only once for all, while keeping sub-scales within the training range. Our approach effectively addresses the distribution drift issue and eliminates artifacts, noise and blurring, producing high-quality, high-resolution super-resolved images. Experimental validations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in ultra-large upsampling tasks (e.g. $\times100$), delivering visual quality far superior to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The capability of generative diffusion models (DMs) like Stable Diffusion (SD) in replicating training data could be taken advantage of by attackers to launch the Copyright Infringement Attack, with duplicated poisoned image-text pairs. SilentBadDiffusion (SBD) is a method proposed recently, which shew outstanding performance in attacking SD in text-to-image tasks. However, the feasible data resources in this area are still limited, some of them are even constrained or prohibited due to the issues like copyright ownership or inappropriate contents; And not all of the images in current datasets are suitable for the proposed attacking methods; Besides, the state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of SBD is far from ideal when few generated poisoning samples could be adopted for attacks. In this paper, we raised new datasets accessible for researching in attacks like SBD, and proposed Multi-Element (ME) attack method based on SBD by increasing the number of poisonous visual-text elements per poisoned sample to enhance the ability of attacking, while importing Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) for the poisoned samples to maintain the stealthiness. The Copyright Infringement Rate (CIR) / First Attack Epoch (FAE) we got on the two new datasets were 16.78% / 39.50 and 51.20% / 23.60, respectively close to or even outperformed benchmark Pokemon and Mijourney datasets. In condition of low subsampling ratio (5%, 6 poisoned samples), MESI and DCT earned CIR / FAE of 0.23% / 84.00 and 12.73% / 65.50, both better than original SBD, which failed to attack at all.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about dynamics governed by physical laws through visual observation, akin to human capabilities in the real world, poses significant challenges. Currently, object-centric dynamic simulation methods, which emulate human behavior, have achieved notable progress but overlook two critical aspects: 1) the integration of physical knowledge into models. Humans gain physical insights by observing the world and apply this knowledge to accurately reason about various dynamic scenarios; 2) the validation of model adaptability across diverse scenarios. Real-world dynamics, especially those involving fluids and objects, demand models that not only capture object interactions but also simulate fluid flow characteristics. To address these gaps, we introduce SlotPi, a slot-based physics-informed object-centric reasoning model. SlotPi integrates a physical module based on Hamiltonian principles with a spatio-temporal prediction module for dynamic forecasting. Our experiments highlight the model's strengths in tasks such as prediction and Visual Question Answering (VQA) on benchmark and fluid datasets. Furthermore, we have created a real-world dataset encompassing object interactions, fluid dynamics, and fluid-object interactions, on which we validated our model's capabilities. The model's robust performance across all datasets underscores its strong adaptability, laying a foundation for developing more advanced world models.

Abstract: With recent advances in modeling and the increasing amount of supervised training data, automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have achieved remarkable performance on general speech. However, the word error rate (WER) of state-of-the-art ASR remains high for named entities. Since named entities are often the most critical keywords, misrecognizing them can affect all downstream applications, especially when the ASR system functions as the front end of a complex system. In this paper, we introduce a large language model (LLM) revision mechanism to revise incorrect named entities in ASR predictions by leveraging the LLM's reasoning ability as well as local context (e.g., lecture notes) containing a set of correct named entities. Finally, we introduce the NER-MIT-OpenCourseWare dataset, containing 45 hours of data from MIT courses for development and testing. On this dataset, our proposed technique achieves up to 30\% relative WER reduction for named entities.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered features have rapidly proliferated across mobile apps in various domains, including productivity, education, entertainment, and creativity. However, how users perceive, evaluate, and critique these AI features remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the overwhelming volume of user feedback. In this work, we present the first comprehensive, large-scale study of user feedback on AI-powered mobile apps, leveraging a curated dataset of 292 AI-driven apps across 14 categories with 894K AI-specific reviews from Google Play. We develop and validate a multi-stage analysis pipeline that begins with a human-labeled benchmark and systematically evaluates large language models (LLMs) and prompting strategies. Each stage, including review classification, aspect-sentiment extraction, and clustering, is validated for accuracy and consistency. Our pipeline enables scalable, high-precision analysis of user feedback, extracting over one million aspect-sentiment pairs clustered into 18 positive and 15 negative user topics. Our analysis reveals that users consistently focus on a narrow set of themes: positive comments emphasize productivity, reliability, and personalized assistance, while negative feedback highlights technical failures (e.g., scanning and recognition), pricing concerns, and limitations in language support. Our pipeline surfaces both satisfaction with one feature and frustration with another within the same review. These fine-grained, co-occurring sentiments are often missed by traditional approaches that treat positive and negative feedback in isolation or rely on coarse-grained analysis. To this end, our approach provides a more faithful reflection of the real-world user experiences with AI-powered apps. Category-aware analysis further uncovers both universal drivers of satisfaction and domain-specific frustrations.

Abstract: Long video understanding (LVU) presents a significant challenge for current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) due to the task's inherent complexity and context window constraint. It is widely assumed that addressing LVU tasks requires foundation MLLMs with extended context windows, strong visual perception capabilities, and proficient domain expertise. In this work, we challenge this common belief by introducing VideoDeepResearch, a novel agentic framework for long video understanding. Our approach relies solely on a text-only large reasoning model (LRM) combined with a modular multi-modal toolkit, including multimodal retrievers and visual perceivers, all of which are readily available in practice. For each LVU task, the system formulates a problem-solving strategy through reasoning, while selectively accessing and utilizing essential video content via tool using. We conduct extensive experiments on popular LVU benchmarks, including MLVU, Video-MME, and LVBench. Our results demonstrate that VideoDeepResearch achieves substantial improvements over existing MLLM baselines, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 9.6%, 6.6%, and 3.9% on MLVU (test), LVBench, and LongVideoBench, respectively. These findings highlight the promise of agentic systems in overcoming key challenges in LVU problems.

Abstract: Following the successful paradigm shift of large language models, leveraging pre-training on a massive corpus of data and fine-tuning on different downstream tasks, generalist models have made their foray into computer vision. The introduction of Segment Anything Model (SAM) set a milestone on segmentation of natural images, inspiring the design of a multitude of architectures for medical image segmentation. In this survey we offer a comprehensive and in-depth investigation on generalist models for medical image segmentation. We start with an introduction on the fundamentals concepts underpinning their development. Then, we provide a taxonomy on the different declinations of SAM in terms of zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning, adapters, on the recent SAM 2, on other innovative models trained on images alone, and others trained on both text and images. We thoroughly analyze their performances at the level of both primary research and best-in-literature, followed by a rigorous comparison with the state-of-the-art task-specific models. We emphasize the need to address challenges in terms of compliance with regulatory frameworks, privacy and security laws, budget, and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI). Finally, we share our perspective on future directions concerning synthetic data, early fusion, lessons learnt from generalist models in natural language processing, agentic AI and physical AI, and clinical translation.

Abstract: Online learning has experienced rapid growth due to its flexibility and accessibility. Personalization, adapted to the needs of individual learners, is crucial for enhancing the learning experience, particularly in online settings. A key aspect of personalization is providing learners with answers customized to their specific questions. This paper therefore explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate personalized answers to learners' questions, thereby enhancing engagement and reducing the workload on educators. To evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, we conducted a comprehensive study using the StackExchange platform in two distinct areas: language learning and programming. We developed a framework and a dataset for validating automatically generated personalized answers. Subsequently, we generated personalized answers using different strategies, including 0-shot, 1-shot, and few-shot scenarios. The generated answers were evaluated using three methods: 1. BERTScore, 2. LLM evaluation, and 3. human evaluation. Our findings indicated that providing LLMs with examples of desired answers (from the learner or similar learners) can significantly enhance the LLMs' ability to tailor responses to individual learners' needs.

Abstract: Deep Learning Systems (DLSs) are increasingly deployed in real-time applications, including those in resourceconstrained environments such as mobile and IoT devices. To address efficiency challenges, Dynamic Deep Learning Systems (DDLSs) adapt inference computation based on input complexity, reducing overhead. While this dynamic behavior improves efficiency, such behavior introduces new attack surfaces. In particular, efficiency adversarial attacks exploit these dynamic mechanisms to degrade system performance. This paper systematically explores efficiency robustness of DDLSs, presenting the first comprehensive taxonomy of efficiency attacks. We categorize these attacks based on three dynamic behaviors: (i) attacks on dynamic computations per inference, (ii) attacks on dynamic inference iterations, and (iii) attacks on dynamic output production for downstream tasks. Through an in-depth evaluation, we analyze adversarial strategies that target DDLSs efficiency and identify key challenges in securing these systems. In addition, we investigate existing defense mechanisms, demonstrating their limitations against increasingly popular efficiency attacks and the necessity for novel mitigation strategies to secure future adaptive DDLSs.

Abstract: Video matting is crucial for applications such as film production and virtual reality, yet deploying its computationally intensive models on resource-constrained devices presents challenges. Quantization is a key technique for model compression and acceleration. As an efficient approach, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is still in its nascent stages for video matting, facing significant hurdles in maintaining accuracy and temporal coherence. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel and general PTQ framework specifically designed for video matting models, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic attempt in this domain. Our contributions include: (1) A two-stage PTQ strategy that combines block-reconstruction-based optimization for fast, stable initial quantization and local dependency capture, followed by a global calibration of quantization parameters to minimize accuracy loss. (2) A Statistically-Driven Global Affine Calibration (GAC) method that enables the network to compensate for cumulative statistical distortions arising from factors such as neglected BN layer effects, even reducing the error of existing PTQ methods on video matting tasks up to 20%. (3) An Optical Flow Assistance (OFA) component that leverages temporal and semantic priors from frames to guide the PTQ process, enhancing the model's ability to distinguish moving foregrounds in complex scenes and ultimately achieving near full-precision performance even under ultra-low-bit quantization. Comprehensive quantitative and visual results show that our PTQ4VM achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy performance across different bit-widths compared to the existing quantization methods. We highlight that the 4-bit PTQ4VM even achieves performance close to the full-precision counterpart while enjoying 8x FLOP savings.

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive LLMs by enabling parallel token generation and significantly reducing inference latency. However, existing sampling strategies for dLLMs, such as confidence-based or semi-autoregressive decoding, often suffer from static behavior, leading to suboptimal efficiency and limited flexibility. In this paper, we propose SlowFast Sampling, a novel dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively alternates between exploratory and accelerated decoding stages. Our method is guided by three golden principles: certainty principle, convergence principle, and positional principle, which govern when and where tokens can be confidently and efficiently decoded. We further integrate our strategy with dLLM-Cache to reduce redundant computation. Extensive experiments across benchmarks and models show that SlowFast Sampling achieves up to 15.63$\times$ speedup on LLaDA with minimal accuracy drop, and up to 34.22$\times$ when combined with caching. Notably, our approach outperforms strong autoregressive baselines like LLaMA3 8B in throughput, demonstrating that well-designed sampling can unlock the full potential of dLLMs for fast and high-quality generation.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity. It comprises 1,010 long videos (with an average duration of 1.6 hours), along with 9,468 human-labeled multi-step question-answering pairs and 30,292 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 16 VLMs on VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

<title>Precise Zero-Shot Pointwise Ranking with LLMs through Post-Aggregated Global Context Information</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements have successfully harnessed the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) for zero-shot document ranking, exploring a variety of prompting strategies. Comparative approaches like pairwise and listwise achieve high effectiveness but are computationally intensive and thus less practical for larger-scale applications. Scoring-based pointwise approaches exhibit superior efficiency by independently and simultaneously generating the relevance scores for each candidate document. However, this independence ignores critical comparative insights between documents, resulting in inconsistent scoring and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we aim to improve the effectiveness of pointwise methods while preserving their efficiency through two key innovations: (1) We propose a novel Global-Consistent Comparative Pointwise Ranking (GCCP) strategy that incorporates global reference comparisons between each candidate and an anchor document to generate contrastive relevance scores. We strategically design the anchor document as a query-focused summary of pseudo-relevant candidates, which serves as an effective reference point by capturing the global context for document comparison. (2) These contrastive relevance scores can be efficiently Post-Aggregated with existing pointwise methods, seamlessly integrating essential Global Context information in a training-free manner (PAGC). Extensive experiments on the TREC DL and BEIR benchmark demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous pointwise methods while maintaining comparable efficiency. Our method also achieves competitive performance against comparative methods that require substantially more computational resources. More analyses further validate the efficacy of our anchor construction strategy.

The multi-scale loss is tested in AIFS-CRPS, a machine-learned weather forecasting model developed at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS-CRPS is trained by directly optimising the almost fair continuous ranked probability score (afCRPS). The multi-scale loss better constrains small scale variability without negatively impacting forecast skill. This opens up promising directions for future work in scale-aware model training.

The approach is based on an integration of dimension reduction (Sequentially Truncated Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition), surrogate modeling (Gaussian Process), and data assimilation techniques (Reduced Order Particle Filter). This approach can be used online and is based on offline data, obtained from the offline collection of high-fidelity simulation data and a set of sparse experimental data. The results have shown that orders of magnitude reduction in computational time can be obtained from the proposed data-driven modeling approach compared with physics-based high-fidelity simulations. With only simulation data as input, the data-driven prediction technique can generate predictions that have comparable accuracy as simulations. With both simulation data and sparse physical experimental measurement as input, the data-driven approach with its embedded data assimilation techniques has the potential in outperforming only high-fidelity simulations for the long-horizon predictions. In addition, it is demonstrated that the data-driven modeling approach can also reproduce the scaling relationship recovered by physics-based simulations for maximum resistive forces, which may indicate its general predictability beyond a case-by-case basis. The results are expected to help robot navigation and exploration in unknown and complex terrains during both online and offline phases.

Abstract: This paper investigates and validates the impact of fine-tuning on large language model performance, focusing on parameter-efficient methods (LoRA and QLoRA). We evaluate model capabilities across three key domains: (1) commonsense reasoning (HellaSwag), (2) mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), and (3) multi-domain knowledge (MMLU-CS).
  Our findings demonstrate that: (1) LoRA-based methods effectively improve task-specific performance while maintaining computational efficiency, and (2) performance strongly depends on alignment between fine-tuning dataset and benchmark tasks. The study provides both theoretical insights into parameter-efficient mechanisms and practical guidance for developers implementing efficient LLM adaptation with limited resources.

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models hold the promise of fast text generation due to their inherent ability to self-correct. However, they are typically outperformed by autoregressive models and masked diffusion models. In this work, we narrow this performance gap by leveraging a key insight: Uniform-state diffusion processes naturally emerge from an underlying Gaussian diffusion. Our method, Duo, transfers powerful techniques from Gaussian diffusion to improve both training and sampling. First, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy guided by the Gaussian process, doubling training speed by reducing variance. Models trained with curriculum learning surpass autoregressive models in zero-shot perplexity on 3 of 7 benchmarks. Second, we present Discrete Consistency Distillation, which adapts consistency distillation from the continuous to the discrete setting. This algorithm unlocks few-step generation in diffusion language models by accelerating sampling by two orders of magnitude. We provide the code and model checkpoints on the project page: http://s-sahoo.github.io/duo

Abstract: Zero-shot generative model adaptation (ZSGM) aims to adapt a pre-trained generator to a target domain using only text guidance and without any samples from the target domain. Central to recent ZSGM approaches are directional loss which use the text guidance in the form of aligning the image offset with text offset in the embedding space of a vision-language model like CLIP. This is similar to the analogical reasoning in NLP where the offset between one pair of words is used to identify a missing element in another pair by aligning the offset between these two pairs. However, a major limitation of existing ZSGM methods is that the learning objective assumes the complete alignment between image offset and text offset in the CLIP embedding space, resulting in quality degrade in generated images. Our work makes two main contributions. Inspired by the offset misalignment studies in NLP, as our first contribution, we perform an empirical study to analyze the misalignment between text offset and image offset in CLIP embedding space for various large publicly available datasets. Our important finding is that offset misalignment in CLIP embedding space is correlated with concept distance, i.e., close concepts have a less offset misalignment. To address the limitations of the current approaches, as our second contribution, we propose Adaptation with Iterative Refinement (AIR) which is the first ZSGM approach to focus on improving target domain image quality based on our new insight on offset misalignment.Qualitative, quantitative, and user study in 26 experiment setups consistently demonstrate the proposed AIR approach achieves SOTA performance. Additional experiments are in Supp.

Abstract: Encoder-based transformer models are central to biomedical and clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP), as their bidirectional self-attention makes them well-suited for efficiently extracting structured information from unstructured text through discriminative tasks. However, encoders have seen slower development compared to decoder models, leading to limited domain adaptation in biomedical and clinical settings. We introduce BioClinical ModernBERT, a domain-adapted encoder that builds on the recent ModernBERT release, incorporating long-context processing and substantial improvements in speed and performance for biomedical and clinical NLP. BioClinical ModernBERT is developed through continued pretraining on the largest biomedical and clinical corpus to date, with over 53.5 billion tokens, and addresses a key limitation of prior clinical encoders by leveraging 20 datasets from diverse institutions, domains, and geographic regions, rather than relying on data from a single source. It outperforms existing biomedical and clinical encoders on four downstream tasks spanning a broad range of use cases. We release both base (150M parameters) and large (396M parameters) versions of BioClinical ModernBERT, along with training checkpoints to support further research.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has significantly enriched content creation and holds the potential to evolve into powerful world simulators. However, modeling the vast spatiotemporal space remains computationally demanding, particularly when employing Transformers, which incur quadratic complexity in sequence processing and thus limit practical applications. Recent advancements in linear-time sequence modeling, particularly the Mamba architecture, offer a more efficient alternative. Nevertheless, its plain design limits its direct applicability to multi-modal and spatiotemporal video generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce M4V, a Multi-Modal Mamba framework for text-to-video generation. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal diffusion Mamba (MM-DiM) block that enables seamless integration of multi-modal information and spatiotemporal modeling through a multi-modal token re-composition design. As a result, the Mamba blocks in M4V reduce FLOPs by 45% compared to the attention-based alternative when generating videos at 768$\times$1280 resolution. Additionally, to mitigate the visual quality degradation in long-context autoregressive generation processes, we introduce a reward learning strategy that further enhances per-frame visual realism. Extensive experiments on text-to-video benchmarks demonstrate M4V's ability to produce high-quality videos while significantly lowering computational costs. Code and models will be publicly available at https://huangjch526.github.io/M4V_project.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes hiring applications, making decisions that directly impact people's careers and livelihoods. While prior studies suggest simple anti-bias prompts can eliminate demographic biases in controlled evaluations, we find these mitigations fail when realistic contextual details are introduced. We address these failures through internal bias mitigation: by identifying and neutralizing sensitive attribute directions within model activations, we achieve robust bias reduction across all tested scenarios. Across leading commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash) and open-source models (Gemma-2 27B, Gemma-3, Mistral-24B), we find that adding realistic context such as company names, culture descriptions from public careers pages, and selective hiring constraints (e.g.,``only accept candidates in the top 10\%") induces significant racial and gender biases (up to 12\% differences in interview rates). When these biases emerge, they consistently favor Black over White candidates and female over male candidates across all tested models and scenarios. Moreover, models can infer demographics and become biased from subtle cues like college affiliations, with these biases remaining invisible even when inspecting the model's chain-of-thought reasoning. To address these limitations, our internal bias mitigation identifies race and gender-correlated directions and applies affine concept editing at inference time. Despite using directions from a simple synthetic dataset, the intervention generalizes robustly, consistently reducing bias to very low levels (typically under 1\%, always below 2.5\%) while largely maintaining model performance. Our findings suggest that practitioners deploying LLMs for hiring should adopt more realistic evaluation methodologies and consider internal mitigation strategies for equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols, allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers, landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.

Abstract: Reduced social connectedness increasingly poses a threat to mental health, life expectancy, and general well-being. Generative AI (GAI) technologies, such as large language models (LLMs) and image generation tools, are increasingly integrated into applications aimed at enhancing human social experiences. Despite their growing presence, little is known about how these technologies influence social interactions. This scoping review investigates how GAI-based applications are currently designed to facilitate social interaction, what forms of social engagement they target, and which design and evaluation methodologies designers use to create and evaluate them. Through an analysis of 30 studies published since 2020, we identify key trends in application domains including storytelling, socio-emotional skills training, reminiscence, collaborative learning, music making, and general conversation. We highlight the role of participatory and co-design approaches in fostering both effective technology use and social engagement, while also examining socio-ethical concerns such as cultural bias and accessibility. This review underscores the potential of GAI to support dynamic and personalized interactions, but calls for greater attention to equitable design practices and inclusive evaluation strategies.

Abstract: In-context image editing aims to modify images based on a contextual sequence comprising text and previously generated images. Existing methods typically depend on task-specific pipelines and expert models (e.g., segmentation and inpainting) to curate training data. In this work, we explore whether an in-context image editing model can be learned directly from videos. We introduce a scalable approach to annotate videos as interleaved multimodal sequences. To effectively learn from this data, we design a block-causal diffusion transformer trained on three proxy tasks: next-image prediction, current segmentation prediction, and next-segmentation prediction. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-turn image editing benchmark to advance research in this area. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model exhibits strong in-context image editing capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art results on two multi-turn image editing benchmarks. Despite being trained exclusively on videos, our model also shows promising abilities in multi-concept composition, story generation, and chain-of-editing applications.

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important due to regulatory compliance, copyright protection, and privacy concerns. However, a key challenge in LLM unlearning is unintended forgetting, where the removal of specific data inadvertently impairs the utility of the model and its retention of valuable, desired information. While prior work has primarily focused on architectural innovations, the influence of data-level factors on unlearning performance remains underexplored. As a result, existing methods often suffer from degraded retention when forgetting high-impact data. To address this, we propose GUARD-a novel framework for Guided Unlearning And Retention via Data attribution. At its core, GUARD introduces a lightweight proxy data attribution metric tailored for LLM unlearning, which quantifies the "alignment" between the forget and retain sets while remaining computationally efficient. Building on this, we design a novel unlearning objective that assigns adaptive, nonuniform unlearning weights to samples, inversely proportional to their proxy attribution scores. Through such a reallocation of unlearning power, GUARD mitigates unintended losses in retention. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees that GUARD significantly enhances retention while maintaining forgetting metrics comparable to prior methods. Extensive experiments on the TOFU benchmark across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that GUARD substantially improves utility preservation while ensuring effective unlearning. Notably, GUARD reduces utility sacrifice on the Retain Set by up to 194.92% in terms of Truth Ratio when forgetting 10% of the training data.

<title>Monitoring Decomposition Attacks in LLMs with Lightweight Sequential Monitors</title>

Abstract: Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent, leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87% attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents. To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate, beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.

Abstract: We introduce~\textsc{Domain2Vec}, a novel approach that decomposes any dataset into a linear combination of several \emph{meta-domains}, a new concept designed to capture the key underlying features of datasets. \textsc{Domain2Vec} maintains a vocabulary of meta-domains and uses a classifier to decompose any given dataset into a domain vector that corresponds to a distribution over this vocabulary. These domain vectors enable the identification of the optimal data mixture for language model (LM) pretraining in a training-free manner under the \emph{\textbf{D}istribution \textbf{A}lignment \textbf{A}ssumption} (DA$^{2}$), which suggests that when the data distributions of the training set and the validation set are better aligned, a lower validation loss is achieved. Moreover, \textsc{Domain2vec} can be seamlessly integrated into previous works to model the relationship between domain vectors and LM performance, greatly enhancing the efficiency and scalability of previous methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textsc{Domain2Vec} helps find the data mixture that enhances downstream task performance with minimal computational overhead. Specifically, \textsc{Domain2Vec} achieves the same validation loss on Pile-CC using only $51.5\%$ of the computation required when training on the original mixture of The Pile dataset. Under equivalent compute budget, \textsc{Domain2Vec} improves downstream performance by an average of $2.83\%$.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale datasets for the GitHub issue resolution task is crucial for both training and evaluating the software engineering capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the traditional process for creating such benchmarks is notoriously challenging and labor-intensive, particularly in the stages of setting up evaluation environments, grading test outcomes, and validating task instances. In this paper, we propose SWE-Factory, an automated pipeline designed to address these challenges. To tackle these issues, our pipeline integrates three core automated components. First, we introduce SWE-Builder, a multi-agent system that automates evaluation environment construction, which employs four specialized agents that work in a collaborative, iterative loop and leverages an environment memory pool to enhance efficiency. Second, we introduce a standardized, exit-code-based grading method that eliminates the need for manually writing custom parsers. Finally, we automate the fail2pass validation process using these reliable exit code signals. Experiments on 671 issues across four programming languages show that our pipeline can effectively construct valid task instances; for example, with GPT-4.1-mini, our SWE-Builder constructs 269 valid instances at $0.045 per instance, while with Gemini-2.5-flash, it achieves comparable performance at the lowest cost of $0.024 per instance. We also demonstrate that our exit-code-based grading achieves 100% accuracy compared to manual inspection, and our automated fail2pass validation reaches a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 1.00. We hope our automated pipeline will accelerate the collection of large-scale, high-quality GitHub issue resolution datasets for both training and evaluation. Our code and datasets are released at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/swe-factory.

Abstract: There has been a flurry of activity around using pretrained diffusion models as informed data priors for solving inverse problems, and more generally around steering these models using reward models. Training-free methods like diffusion posterior sampling (DPS) and its many variants have offered flexible heuristic algorithms for these tasks, but when the reward is not informative enough, e.g., in hard inverse problems with low signal-to-noise ratio, these techniques veer off the data manifold, failing to produce realistic outputs. In this work, we devise a simple wrapper, ReGuidance, for boosting both the sample realism and reward achieved by these methods. Given a candidate solution $\hat{x}$ produced by an algorithm of the user's choice, we propose inverting the solution by running the unconditional probability flow ODE in reverse starting from $\hat{x}$, and then using the resulting latent as an initialization for DPS. We evaluate our wrapper on hard inverse problems like large box in-painting and super-resolution with high upscaling. Whereas state-of-the-art baselines visibly fail, we find that applying our wrapper on top of these baselines significantly boosts sample quality and measurement consistency. We complement these findings with theory proving that on certain multimodal data distributions, ReGuidance simultaneously boosts the reward and brings the candidate solution closer to the data manifold. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first rigorous algorithmic guarantee for DPS.

Abstract: While in-context learning (ICL) has achieved remarkable success in natural language and vision domains, its theoretical understanding--particularly in the context of structured geometric data--remains unexplored. In this work, we initiate a theoretical study of ICL for regression of H\"older functions on manifolds. By establishing a novel connection between the attention mechanism and classical kernel methods, we derive generalization error bounds in terms of the prompt length and the number of training tasks. When a sufficient number of training tasks are observed, transformers give rise to the minimax regression rate of H\"older functions on manifolds, which scales exponentially with the intrinsic dimension of the manifold, rather than the ambient space dimension. Our result also characterizes how the generalization error scales with the number of training tasks, shedding light on the complexity of transformers as in-context algorithm learners. Our findings provide foundational insights into the role of geometry in ICL and novels tools to study ICL of nonlinear models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to automated harmful content detection tasks, assisting moderators in identifying policy violations and improving the overall efficiency and accuracy of content review. However, existing resources for harmful content detection are predominantly focused on English, with Chinese datasets remaining scarce and often limited in scope. We present a comprehensive, professionally annotated benchmark for Chinese content harm detection, which covers six representative categories and is constructed entirely from real-world data. Our annotation process further yields a knowledge rule base that provides explicit expert knowledge to assist LLMs in Chinese harmful content detection. In addition, we propose a knowledge-augmented baseline that integrates both human-annotated knowledge rules and implicit knowledge from large language models, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ChineseHarm-bench.

Abstract: Autoregressive visual generation has garnered increasing attention due to its scalability and compatibility with other modalities compared with diffusion models. Most existing methods construct visual sequences as spatial patches for autoregressive generation. However, image patches are inherently parallel, contradicting the causal nature of autoregressive modeling. To address this, we propose a Spectral AutoRegressive (SpectralAR) visual generation framework, which realizes causality for visual sequences from the spectral perspective. Specifically, we first transform an image into ordered spectral tokens with Nested Spectral Tokenization, representing lower to higher frequency components. We then perform autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner with the sequences of spectral tokens. By considering different levels of detail in images, our SpectralAR achieves both sequence causality and token efficiency without bells and whistles. We conduct extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K for image reconstruction and autoregressive generation, and SpectralAR achieves 3.02 gFID with only 64 tokens and 310M parameters.

<title>Beyond Attention or Similarity: Maximizing Conditional Diversity for Token Pruning in MLLMs</title>

Abstract: In multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the length of input visual tokens is often significantly greater than that of their textual counterparts, leading to a high inference cost. Many works aim to address this issue by removing redundant visual tokens. However, current approaches either rely on attention-based pruning, which retains numerous duplicate tokens, or use similarity-based pruning, overlooking the instruction relevance, consequently causing suboptimal performance. In this paper, we go beyond attention or similarity by proposing a novel visual token pruning method named CDPruner, which maximizes the conditional diversity of retained tokens. We first define the conditional similarity between visual tokens conditioned on the instruction, and then reformulate the token pruning problem with determinantal point process (DPP) to maximize the conditional diversity of the selected subset. The proposed CDPruner is training-free and model-agnostic, allowing easy application to various MLLMs. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs show that CDPruner establishes new state-of-the-art on various vision-language benchmarks. By maximizing conditional diversity through DPP, the selected subset better represents the input images while closely adhering to user instructions, thereby preserving strong performance even with high reduction ratios. When applied to LLaVA, CDPruner reduces FLOPs by 95\% and CUDA latency by 78\%, while maintaining 94\% of the original accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/Theia-4869/CDPruner.

To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

<title>Principled Approaches for Extending Neural Architectures to Function Spaces for Operator Learning</title>

Abstract: A wide range of scientific problems, such as those described by continuous-time dynamical systems and partial differential equations (PDEs), are naturally formulated on function spaces. While function spaces are typically infinite-dimensional, deep learning has predominantly advanced through applications in computer vision and natural language processing that focus on mappings between finite-dimensional spaces. Such fundamental disparities in the nature of the data have limited neural networks from achieving a comparable level of success in scientific applications as seen in other fields. Neural operators are a principled way to generalize neural networks to mappings between function spaces, offering a pathway to replicate deep learning's transformative impact on scientific problems. For instance, neural operators can learn solution operators for entire classes of PDEs, e.g., physical systems with different boundary conditions, coefficient functions, and geometries. A key factor in deep learning's success has been the careful engineering of neural architectures through extensive empirical testing. Translating these neural architectures into neural operators allows operator learning to enjoy these same empirical optimizations. However, prior neural operator architectures have often been introduced as standalone models, not directly derived as extensions of existing neural network architectures. In this paper, we identify and distill the key principles for constructing practical implementations of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. Using these principles, we propose a recipe for converting several popular neural architectures into neural operators with minimal modifications. This paper aims to guide practitioners through this process and details the steps to make neural operators work in practice. Our code can be found at https://github.com/neuraloperator/NNs-to-NOs

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential in addressing real-world data science problems. LLM-driven data science agents promise to automate the entire machine learning pipeline, yet their real-world effectiveness remains limited. Existing frameworks depend on rigid, pre-defined workflows and inflexible coding strategies; consequently, they excel only on relatively simple, classical problems and fail to capture the empirical expertise that human practitioners bring to complex, innovative tasks. In this work, we introduce AutoMind, an adaptive, knowledgeable LLM-agent framework that overcomes these deficiencies through three key advances: (1) a curated expert knowledge base that grounds the agent in domain expert knowledge, (2) an agentic knowledgeable tree search algorithm that strategically explores possible solutions, and (3) a self-adaptive coding strategy that dynamically tailors code generation to task complexity. Evaluations on two automated data science benchmarks demonstrate that AutoMind delivers superior performance versus state-of-the-art baselines. Additional analyses confirm favorable effectiveness, efficiency, and qualitative solution quality, highlighting AutoMind as an efficient and robust step toward fully automated data science.

Abstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose "HeadHunter", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion bridges are a promising class of deep-learning methods for sampling from unnormalized distributions. Recent works show that the Log Variance (LV) loss consistently outperforms the reverse Kullback-Leibler (rKL) loss when using the reparametrization trick to compute rKL-gradients. While the on-policy LV loss yields identical gradients to the rKL loss when combined with the log-derivative trick for diffusion samplers with non-learnable forward processes, this equivalence does not hold for diffusion bridges or when diffusion coefficients are learned. Based on this insight we argue that for diffusion bridges the LV loss does not represent an optimization objective that can be motivated like the rKL loss via the data processing inequality. Our analysis shows that employing the rKL loss with the log-derivative trick (rKL-LD) does not only avoid these conceptual problems but also consistently outperforms the LV loss. Experimental results with different types of diffusion bridges on challenging benchmarks show that samplers trained with the rKL-LD loss achieve better performance. From a practical perspective we find that rKL-LD requires significantly less hyperparameter optimization and yields more stable training behavior.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) is a common approach for Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in AI tasks. Embedding dimensions depend on application scenarios. Requiring a new dimension means training a new KGE model from scratch, increasing cost and limiting efficiency and flexibility. In this work, we propose a novel KGE training framework MED. It allows one training to obtain a croppable KGE model for multiple scenarios with different dimensional needs. Sub-models of required dimensions can be directly cropped and used without extra training. In MED, we propose a mutual learning mechanism to improve the low-dimensional sub-models and make high-dimensional sub-models retain the low-dimensional sub-models' capacity, an evolutionary improvement mechanism to promote the high-dimensional sub-models to master the triple that the low-dimensional sub-models can not, and a dynamic loss weight to adaptively balance the multiple losses. Experiments on 4 KGE models across 4 standard KG completion datasets, 3 real-world scenarios using a large-scale KG, and extending MED to the BERT language model demonstrate its effectiveness, high efficiency, and flexible extensibility.

Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods mainly rely on trial-and-error exploration, often lacking mechanisms to guide agents toward more informative decision-making and struggling to leverage past experiences, resulting in low sample efficiency. To overcome this issue, we propose an innovative framework inspired by cognitive principles: Cognitive Belief-Driven Reinforcement Learning (CBD-RL). By incorporating cognitive heuristics, CBD-RL transforms conventional trial-and-error learning into a more structured and guided learning paradigm, simulating the human reasoning process. This framework's core is a belief system that optimizes action probabilities by integrating feedback with prior experience, thus enhancing decision making under uncertainty. It also organizes state-action pairs into meaningful categories, promoting generalization and improving sample efficiency. The concrete implementations of this framework, CBDQ, CBDPPO, and CBDSAC, demonstrate superior performance in discrete and continuous action spaces in diverse environments such as Atari and MuJoCo. By bridging cognitive science and reinforcement learning, this research opens a new avenue for developing RL systems that are more interpretable, efficient, and cognitively inspired.

Abstract: We introduce Constrained Human-AI Cooperation (CHAIC), an inclusive embodied social intelligence challenge designed to test social perception and cooperation in embodied agents. In CHAIC, the goal is for an embodied agent equipped with egocentric observations to assist a human who may be operating under physical constraints -- e.g., unable to reach high places or confined to a wheelchair -- in performing common household or outdoor tasks as efficiently as possible. To achieve this, a successful helper must: (1) infer the human's intents and constraints by following the human and observing their behaviors (social perception), and (2) make a cooperative plan tailored to the human partner to solve the task as quickly as possible, working together as a team (cooperative planning). To benchmark this challenge, we create four new agents with real physical constraints and eight long-horizon tasks featuring both indoor and outdoor scenes with various constraints, emergency events, and potential risks. We benchmark planning- and learning-based baselines on the challenge and introduce a new method that leverages large language models and behavior modeling. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark in enabling systematic assessment of key aspects of machine social intelligence. Our benchmark and code are publicly available at https://github.com/UMass-Embodied-AGI/CHAIC.

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.

<title>Position: Theory of Mind Benchmarks are Broken for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Our paper argues that the majority of theory of mind benchmarks are broken because of their inability to directly test how large language models (LLMs) adapt to new partners. This problem stems from the fact that theory of mind benchmarks for LLMs are overwhelmingly inspired by the methods used to test theory of mind in humans and fall victim to a fallacy of attributing human-like qualities to AI agents. We expect that humans will engage in a consistent reasoning process across various questions about a situation, but this is known to not be the case for current LLMs. Most theory of mind benchmarks only measure what we call literal theory of mind: the ability to predict the behavior of others. However, this type of metric is only informative when agents exhibit self-consistent reasoning. Thus, we introduce the concept of functional theory of mind: the ability to adapt to agents in-context following a rational response to their behavior. We find that many open source LLMs are capable of displaying strong literal theory of mind capabilities, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even with exceedingly simple partner policies. Simply put, strong literal theory of mind performance does not necessarily imply strong functional theory of mind performance or vice versa. Achieving functional theory of mind, particularly over long interaction horizons with a partner, is a significant challenge deserving a prominent role in any meaningful LLM theory of mind evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models are typically trained with next-turn rewards, limiting their ability to optimize for long-term interaction. As a result, they often respond passively to ambiguous or open-ended user requests, failing to help users reach their ultimate intents and leading to inefficient conversations. To address these limitations, we introduce CollabLLM, a novel and general training framework that enhances multiturn human-LLM collaboration. Its key innovation is a collaborative simulation that estimates the long-term contribution of responses using Multiturn-aware Rewards. By reinforcement fine-tuning these rewards, CollabLLM goes beyond responding to user requests, and actively uncovers user intent and offers insightful suggestions-a key step towards more human-centered AI. We also devise a multiturn interaction benchmark with three challenging tasks such as document creation. CollabLLM significantly outperforms our baselines with averages of 18.5% higher task performance and 46.3% improved interactivity by LLM judges. Finally, we conduct a large user study with 201 judges, where CollabLLM increases user satisfaction by 17.6% and reduces user spent time by 10.4%.

Abstract: There is growing concern over the safety of powerful diffusion models (DMs), as they are often misused to produce inappropriate, not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content or generate copyrighted material or data of individuals who wish to be forgotten. Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.

<title>Wider or Deeper? Scaling LLM Inference-Time Compute with Adaptive Branching Tree Search</title>

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that increasing inference-time computation can significantly boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although repeated sampling (i.e., generating multiple candidate outputs) is a highly effective strategy, it does not leverage external feedback signals for refinement, which are often available in tasks like coding. In this work, we propose Adaptive Branching Monte Carlo Tree Search (AB-MCTS), a novel inference-time framework that generalizes repeated sampling with principled multi-turn exploration and exploitation. At each node in the search tree, AB-MCTS dynamically decides whether to "go wider" by expanding new candidate responses or "go deeper" by revisiting existing ones based on external feedback signals. We evaluate our method on complex coding and engineering tasks using frontier models. Empirical results show that AB-MCTS consistently outperforms both repeated sampling and standard MCTS, underscoring the importance of combining the response diversity of LLMs with multi-turn solution refinement for effective inference-time scaling.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a major threat to vision systems by embedding localized perturbations that mislead deep models. Traditional defense methods often require retraining or fine-tuning, making them impractical for real-world deployment. We propose a training-free Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VRAG) framework that integrates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for adversarial patch detection. By retrieving visually similar patches and images that resemble stored attacks in a continuously expanding database, VRAG performs generative reasoning to identify diverse attack types, all without additional training or fine-tuning. We extensively evaluate open-source large-scale VLMs, including Qwen-VL-Plus, Qwen2.5-VL-72B, and UI-TARS-72B-DPO, alongside Gemini-2.0, a closed-source model. Notably, the open-source UI-TARS-72B-DPO model achieves up to 95 percent classification accuracy, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source adversarial patch detection. Gemini-2.0 attains the highest overall accuracy, 98 percent, but remains closed-source. Experimental results demonstrate VRAG's effectiveness in identifying a variety of adversarial patches with minimal human annotation, paving the way for robust, practical defenses against evolving adversarial patch attacks.

Abstract: Assistance games are a promising alternative to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for training AI assistants. Assistance games resolve key drawbacks of RLHF, such as incentives for deceptive behavior, by explicitly modeling the interaction between assistant and user as a two-player game where the assistant cannot observe their shared goal. Despite their potential, assistance games have only been explored in simple settings. Scaling them to more complex environments is difficult because it requires both solving intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty and accurately modeling human users' behavior. We present the first scalable approach to solving assistance games and apply it to a new, challenging Minecraft-based assistance game with over $10^{400}$ possible goals. Our approach, AssistanceZero, extends AlphaZero with a neural network that predicts human actions and rewards, enabling it to plan under uncertainty. We show that AssistanceZero outperforms model-free RL algorithms and imitation learning in the Minecraft-based assistance game. In a human study, our AssistanceZero-trained assistant significantly reduces the number of actions participants take to complete building tasks in Minecraft. Our results suggest that assistance games are a tractable framework for training effective AI assistants in complex environments. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/cassidylaidlaw/minecraft-building-assistance-game.

Abstract: Maritime Inventory Routing Problem (MIRP) plays a crucial role in the integration of global maritime commerce levels. However, there are still no well-established methodologies capable of efficiently solving large MIRP instances or their variants due to the high complexity of the problem. The adoption of exact methods, typically based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), for daily operations is nearly impractical due to the CPU time required, as planning must be executed multiple times while ensuring high-quality results within acceptable time limits. Non-MIP-based heuristics are less frequently applied due to the highly constrained nature of the problem, which makes even the construction of an effective initial solution challenging. Papageorgiou et al. (2014) introduced a single-product MIRP as the foundation for MIRPLib, aiming to provide a collection of publicly available benchmark instances. However, only a few studies that propose new methodologies have been published since then. To encourage the use of MIRPLib and facilitate result comparisons, this study presents a heuristic approach that does not rely on mathematical optimization techniques to solve a deterministic, finite-horizon, single-product MIRP. The proposed heuristic combines a variation of a Beam Search algorithm with an Iterated Local Search procedure. Among the 72 instances tested, the developed methodology can improve the best-known solution for 19 instances within an acceptable CPU time.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity, intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision; DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

Abstract: Recently, machine learning methods have gained significant traction in scientific computing, particularly for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) often lack convergence guarantees and computational efficiency compared to traditional numerical schemes. This work introduces DeePoly, a novel framework that transforms the solution paradigm from pure non-convex parameter optimization to a two-stage approach: first employing a DNN to capture complex global features, followed by linear space optimization with combined DNN-extracted features (Scoper) and polynomial basis functions (Sniper). This strategic combination leverages the complementary strengths of both methods -- DNNs excel at approximating complex global features (i.e., high-gradient features) and stabilize the polynomial approximation while polynomial bases provide high-precision local corrections with convergence guarantees. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances both high-order accuracy and efficiency across diverse problem types while maintaining mesh-free and scheme-free properties. This paper also serves as a theoretical exposition for the open-source project DeePoly.

Abstract: Law has long been a domain that has been popular in natural language processing (NLP) applications. Reasoning (ratiocination and the ability to make connections to precedent) is a core part of the practice of the law in the real world. Nevertheless, while multiple legal datasets exist, none have thus far focused specifically on reasoning tasks. We focus on a specific aspect of the legal landscape by introducing a corporate governance reasoning benchmark (CHANCERY) to test a model's ability to reason about whether executive/board/shareholder's proposed actions are consistent with corporate governance charters. This benchmark introduces a first-of-its-kind corporate governance reasoning test for language models - modeled after real world corporate governance law. The benchmark consists of a corporate charter (a set of governing covenants) and a proposal for executive action. The model's task is one of binary classification: reason about whether the action is consistent with the rules contained within the charter. We create the benchmark following established principles of corporate governance - 24 concrete corporate governance principles established in and 79 real life corporate charters selected to represent diverse industries from a total dataset of 10k real life corporate charters. Evaluations on state-of-the-art (SOTA) reasoning models confirm the difficulty of the benchmark, with models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet and GPT-4o achieving 64.5% and 75.2% accuracy respectively. Reasoning agents exhibit superior performance, with agents based on the ReAct and CodeAct frameworks scoring 76.1% and 78.1% respectively, further confirming the advanced legal reasoning capabilities required to score highly on the benchmark. We also conduct an analysis of the types of questions which current reasoning models struggle on, revealing insights into the legal reasoning capabilities of SOTA models.

<title>The Packing Chromatic Number of the Infinite Square Grid is 15</title>

Abstract: A packing $k$-coloring is a natural variation on the standard notion of graph $k$-coloring, where vertices are assigned numbers from $\{1, \ldots, k\}$, and any two vertices assigned a common color $c \in \{1, \ldots, k\}$ need to be at a distance greater than $c$ (as opposed to $1$, in standard graph colorings). Despite a sequence of incremental work, determining the packing chromatic number of the infinite square grid has remained an open problem since its introduction in 2002. We culminate the search by proving this number to be 15. We achieve this result by improving the best-known method for this problem by roughly two orders of magnitude. The most important technique to boost performance is a novel and surprisingly effective propositional encoding. Additionally, we developed a new symmetry-breaking method. Since both new techniques are more complex than existing techniques for this problem, a verified approach is required to trust them. We include both techniques in a proof of unsatisfiability, reducing the trusted core to the correctness of the direct encoding.

Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm is the algorithm we use to train neural networks. However, it remains poorly understood how the SGD navigates the highly nonlinear and degenerate loss landscape of a neural network. In this work, we show that the minibatch noise of SGD regularizes the solution towards a noise-balanced solution whenever the loss function contains a rescaling parameter symmetry. Because the difference between a simple diffusion process and SGD dynamics is the most significant when symmetries are present, our theory implies that the loss function symmetries constitute an essential probe of how SGD works. We then apply this result to derive the stationary distribution of stochastic gradient flow for a diagonal linear network with arbitrary depth and width. The stationary distribution exhibits complicated nonlinear phenomena such as phase transitions, broken ergodicity, and fluctuation inversion. These phenomena are shown to exist uniquely in deep networks, implying a fundamental difference between deep and shallow models.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs often suffer from incompleteness issues, which can be alleviated through information completion. However, current state-of-the-art deep knowledge convolutional embedding models rely on external convolution kernels and conventional convolution processes, which limits the feature interaction capability of the model. This paper introduces a novel dynamic convolutional embedding model, ConvD, which directly reshapes relation embeddings into multiple internal convolution kernels. This approach effectively enhances the feature interactions between relation embeddings and entity embeddings. Simultaneously, we incorporate a priori knowledge-optimized attention mechanism that assigns different contribution weight coefficients to the multiple relation convolution kernels in dynamic convolution, further boosting the expressive power of the model. Extensive experiments on various datasets show that our proposed model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods, with average improvements ranging from 3.28% to 14.69% across all model evaluation metrics, while the number of parameters is reduced by 50.66% to 85.40% compared to other state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Class imbalance severely impacts machine learning performance on minority classes in real-world applications. While various solutions exist, active learning offers a fundamental fix by strategically collecting balanced, informative labeled examples from abundant unlabeled data. We introduce DIRECT, an algorithm that identifies class separation boundaries and selects the most uncertain nearby examples for annotation. By reducing the problem to one-dimensional active learning, DIRECT leverages established theory to handle batch labeling and label noise -- another common challenge in data annotation that particularly affects active learning methods. Our work presents the first comprehensive study of active learning under both class imbalance and label noise. Extensive experiments on imbalanced datasets show DIRECT reduces annotation costs by over 60\% compared to state-of-the-art active learning methods and over 80\% versus random sampling, while maintaining robustness to label noise.

Abstract: Previous research on behavior-based attack detection for networks of IoT devices has resulted in machine learning models whose ability to adapt to unseen data is limited and often not demonstrated. This paper presents IoTGeM, an approach for modeling IoT network attacks that focuses on generalizability, yet also leads to better detection and performance. We first introduce an improved rolling window approach for feature extraction. To reduce overfitting, we then apply a multi-step feature selection process where a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is uniquely guided by exogenous feedback from a separate, independent dataset. To prevent common data leaks that have limited previous models, we build and test our models using strictly isolated train and test datasets. The resulting models are rigorously evaluated using a diverse portfolio of machine learning algorithms and datasets. Our window-based models demonstrate superior generalization compared to traditional flow-based models, particularly when tested on unseen datasets. On these stringent, cross-dataset tests, IoTGeM achieves F1 scores of 99\% for ACK, HTTP, SYN, MHD, and PS attacks, as well as a 94\% F1 score for UDP attacks. Finally, we build confidence in the models by using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) explainable AI technique, allowing us to identify the specific features that underlie the accurate detection of attacks.

Abstract: Center-based clustering has attracted significant research interest from both theory and practice. In many practical applications, input data often contain background knowledge that can be used to improve clustering results. In this work, we build on widely adopted $k$-center clustering and model its input background knowledge as must-link (ML) and cannot-link (CL) constraint sets. However, most clustering problems including $k$-center are inherently $\mathcal{NP}$-hard, while the more complex constrained variants are known to suffer severer approximation and computation barriers that significantly limit their applicability. By employing a suite of techniques including reverse dominating sets, linear programming (LP) integral polyhedron, and LP duality, we arrive at the first efficient approximation algorithm for constrained $k$-center with the best possible ratio of 2. We also construct competitive baseline algorithms and empirically evaluate our approximation algorithm against them on a variety of real datasets. The results validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the great advantages of our algorithm in terms of clustering cost, clustering quality, and running time.

<title>Mitigating Object Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via Image-Grounded Guidance</title>

Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has increasingly highlighted the critical issue of their tendency to hallucinate non-existing objects in the images. To address this issue, previous works focused on using specially curated datasets or powerful LLMs to rectify the outputs of LVLMs. However, these approaches require either costly training or fine-tuning, or API access to proprietary LLMs for post-generation correction. In response to these limitations, we propose Mitigating hallucinAtion via image-gRounded guIdaNcE (MARINE), a framework that is both training-free and API-free. MARINE effectively and efficiently reduces object hallucinations during inference by introducing image-grounded guidance to LVLMs. This is achieved by leveraging open-source vision models to extract object-level information, thereby enhancing the precision of LVLM-generated content. Our framework's flexibility further allows for the integration of multiple vision models, enabling more reliable and robust object-level guidance. Through comprehensive evaluations across 5 popular LVLMs with diverse evaluation metrics and benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MARINE, which even outperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods. Remarkably, it reduces hallucinations consistently in GPT-4V-assisted evaluation while maintaining the detailedness of LVLMs' generations. We release our code at https://github.com/Linxi-ZHAO/MARINE.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly transformed the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Their impact extends across a diverse spectrum of tasks, revolutionizing how we approach language understanding and generations. Nevertheless, alongside their remarkable utility, LLMs introduce critical security and risk considerations. These challenges warrant careful examination to ensure responsible deployment and safeguard against potential vulnerabilities. This research paper thoroughly investigates security and privacy concerns related to LLMs from five thematic perspectives: security and privacy concerns, vulnerabilities against adversarial attacks, potential harms caused by misuses of LLMs, mitigation strategies to address these challenges while identifying limitations of current strategies. Lastly, the paper recommends promising avenues for future research to enhance the security and risk management of LLMs.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements, large multimodal models (LMMs) still struggle to bridge the gap between low-level visual perception -- focusing on shapes, sizes, and layouts -- and high-level language reasoning, such as semantics and logic. This limitation is evident in tasks that require precise visual perception, like comparing geometric properties or solving visual reasoning problems. To study this failure mode, we focus on vector graphics -- images composed of 2D objects and shapes, prevalent in LMM-based tasks in web, design, and OS environments. We identify two key research questions: how can we enable precise visual perception, and how can we facilitate high-level reasoning based on such low-level perceptions? To capture fine visual details, we use Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) for accurate encoding of visual scenes. However, SVGs are not readily interpretable by LMMs in a zero-shot manner. To tackle this, we propose the Visually Descriptive Language Model (VDLM), which introduces a Primal Visual Description (PVD) as an intermediate textual representation. PVD translates SVGs into a text-based abstraction consisting of primitive attributes (e.g., shape, position, measurement) and their corresponding values. PVD can be learned using task-agnostic synthesized data and represents visual primitives that are universal across vector graphics. This abstraction is more structured, allowing for direct interpretation by foundation models for zero-shot generalization. Without human-annotated data, empirical results show that VDLM significantly improves state-of-the-art LMMs like GPT-4o on various multimodal perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive analyses of VDLM show improved interpretability due to its disentangled perception and reasoning. We also demonstrate a positive correlation between PVD quality and task performance.

Abstract: While the success of large language models (LLMs) increases demand for machine-generated text, current pay-per-token pricing schemes create a misalignment of incentives known in economics as moral hazard: Text-generating agents have strong incentive to cut costs by preferring a cheaper model over the cutting-edge one, and this can be done "behind the scenes" since the agent performs inference internally. In this work, we approach this issue from an economic perspective, by proposing a pay-for-performance, contract-based framework for incentivizing quality. We study a principal-agent game where the agent generates text using costly inference, and the contract determines the principal's payment for the text according to an automated quality evaluation. Since standard contract theory is inapplicable when internal inference costs are unknown, we introduce cost-robust contracts. As our main theoretical contribution, we characterize optimal cost-robust contracts through a direct correspondence to optimal composite hypothesis tests from statistics, generalizing a result of Saig et al. (NeurIPS'23). We evaluate our framework empirically by deriving contracts for a range of objectives and LLM evaluation benchmarks, and find that cost-robust contracts sacrifice only a marginal increase in objective value compared to their cost-aware counterparts.

Abstract: Hate speech poses a significant threat to social harmony. Over the past two years, Indonesia has seen a ten-fold increase in the online hate speech ratio, underscoring the urgent need for effective detection mechanisms. However, progress is hindered by the limited availability of labeled data for Indonesian texts. The condition is even worse for marginalized minorities, such as Shia, LGBTQ, and other ethnic minorities because hate speech is underreported and less understood by detection tools. Furthermore, the lack of accommodation for subjectivity in current datasets compounds this issue. To address this, we introduce IndoToxic2024, a comprehensive Indonesian hate speech and toxicity classification dataset. Comprising 43,692 entries annotated by 19 diverse individuals, the dataset focuses on texts targeting vulnerable groups in Indonesia, specifically during the hottest political event in the country: the presidential election. We establish baselines for seven binary classification tasks, achieving a macro-F1 score of 0.78 with a BERT model (IndoBERTweet) fine-tuned for hate speech classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate how incorporating demographic information can enhance the zero-shot performance of the large language model, gpt-3.5-turbo. However, we also caution that an overemphasis on demographic information can negatively impact the fine-tuned model performance due to data fragmentation.

Abstract: Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems play an important role in next generation communication networks due to their ability to provide extensive global coverage with guaranteed communications in remote areas and isolated areas where base stations cannot be cost-efficiently deployed. With the pervasive adoption of LEO satellite systems, especially in the LEO Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios, their spectrum resource management requirements have become more complex as a result of massive service requests and high bandwidth demand from terrestrial terminals. For instance, when leasing the spectrum to terrestrial users and controlling the uplink transmit power, satellites collect user data for machine learning purposes, which usually are sensitive information such as location, budget and quality of service (QoS) requirement. To facilitate model training in LEO IoT while preserving the privacy of data, blockchain-driven federated learning (FL) is widely used by leveraging on a fully decentralized architecture. In this paper, we propose a hybrid spectrum pricing and power control framework for LEO IoT by combining blockchain technology and FL. We first design a local deep reinforcement learning algorithm for LEO satellite systems to learn a revenue-maximizing pricing and power control scheme. Then the agents collaborate to form a FL system. We also propose a reputation-based blockchain which is used in the global model aggregation phase of FL. Based on the reputation mechanism, a node is selected for each global training round to perform model aggregation and block generation, which can further enhance the decentralization of the network and guarantee the trust. Simulation tests are conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed scheme. Our results show the efficiency of finding the maximum revenue scheme for LEO satellite systems while preserving the privacy of each agent.

Abstract: Growing concerns over the theft and misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) have heightened the need for effective fingerprinting, which links a model to its original version to detect misuse. In this paper, we define five key properties for a successful fingerprint: Transparency, Efficiency, Persistence, Robustness, and Unforgeability. We introduce a novel fingerprinting framework that provides verifiable proof of ownership while maintaining fingerprint integrity. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we propose a Chain and Hash technique that cryptographically binds fingerprint prompts with their responses, ensuring no adversary can generate colliding fingerprints and allowing model owners to irrefutably demonstrate their creation. Second, we address a realistic threat model in which instruction-tuned models' output distribution can be significantly altered through meta-prompts. By integrating random padding and varied meta-prompt configurations during training, our method preserves fingerprint robustness even when the model's output style is significantly modified. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework offers strong security for proving ownership and remains resilient against benign transformations like fine-tuning, as well as adversarial attempts to erase fingerprints. Finally, we also demonstrate its applicability to fingerprinting LoRA adapters.

Abstract: While past works have shown how uncertainty quantification can be applied to large language model (LLM) outputs, the question of whether resulting uncertainty guarantees still hold within sub-groupings of data remains open. In our work, given some long-form text generated by an LLM, we study uncertainty at both the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Using biography generation as a testbed for this study, we derive a set of (demographic) attributes (e.g., whether some text describes a man or woman) for each generation to form such "subgroups" of data. We find that although canonical methods for both types of uncertainty quantification perform well when measuring across the entire dataset, such guarantees break down when examining particular subgroups. Having established this issue, we invoke group-conditional methods for uncertainty quantification -- multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction -- and find that across a variety of approaches, additional subgroup information consistently improves calibration and conformal prediction within subgroups (while crucially retaining guarantees across the entire dataset). As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these results to form a benchmark for this setting.

Abstract: Time series generation is widely used in real-world applications such as simulation, data augmentation, and hypothesis testing. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the de facto approach to time series generation, enabling diverse synthesis scenarios. However, the fixed standard-Gaussian diffusion prior may be ill-suited for general time series data, such as temporal order and fixed points. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a framework that flexibly synthesizes time series data by using diffusion bridges to learn paths between a chosen prior and the data distribution. We then explore several prior designs tailored to time series synthesis. Our framework covers (i) data- and time-dependent priors for unconditional generation and (ii) scale-preserving priors for conditional generation. Experiments show that our framework with data-driven priors outperforms standard diffusion models on time series generation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for generating synthetic Preference Optimization (PO) datasets using multi-model workflows. We evaluate the effectiveness and potential of these workflows in automating and enhancing the dataset generation process. PO dataset generation requires two modules: (1) $\textit{response evaluation}$, and (2) $\textit{response generation}$. In the $\textit{response evaluation}$ module, the responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) are evaluated and ranked - a task typically carried out by human annotators that we automate using LLMs. We assess the response evaluation module in a 2 step process. In step 1, we assess LLMs as evaluators using three distinct prompting strategies. In step 2, we apply the winning prompting strategy to compare the performance of LLM-as-a-Judge, LLMs-as-a-Jury, and LLM Debate. Our evaluation shows that GPT-4o-as-a-Judge is more consistent across all datasets. For the $\textit{response generation}$ module, we use the identified LLM evaluator configuration and compare different configurations of the LLM Feedback Loop. We use the win rate to determine the best multi-model configuration for generation. Experimenting with various configurations, we find that the LLM Feedback Loop, with Llama as the generator and Gemma as the reviewer, achieves a notable 71.8% and 73.8% win rate over single-model Llama and Gemma, respectively. After identifying the best configurations for both modules, we generate our PO datasets using the above pipeline.

Abstract: Detecting issue framing in text - how different perspectives approach the same topic - is valuable for social science and policy analysis, yet challenging for automated methods due to subtle linguistic differences. We introduce `paired completion', a novel approach using LLM next-token log probabilities to detect contrasting frames using minimal examples. Through extensive evaluation across synthetic datasets and a human-labeled corpus, we demonstrate that paired completion is a cost-efficient, low-bias alternative to both prompt-based and embedding-based methods, offering a scalable solution for analyzing issue framing in large text collections, especially suited to low-resource settings.

Abstract: Current multimodal learning strategies primarily optimize in the original token space. Such a framework is easy to incorporate with the backbone of pretrained language model, but might result in modality collapse. To alleviate such issues, we leverage the joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) on the multimodal tasks, which converts the input embedding into the output embedding space by a predictor and then conducts the cross-modal alignment on the latent space. We implement this predictor by a Multi-Gate Mixture of Experts (MMoE) and name the framework as M3-JEPA, accordingly. The gating function disentangles the modality-specific and shared information and derives information-theoretic optimality. The framework is implemented with both contrastive and regularization loss, and solved by alternative gradient descent (AGD) between different multimodal tasks. By thoroughly designed experiments, we show that M3-JEPA can obtain state-of-the-art performance on different modalities and tasks, generalize to unseen datasets and domains, and is computationally efficient in both training and inference. Our observation suggests that M3-JEPA might become a new basis to self-supervised learning in the open world.

Abstract: We show that feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation generalize on low complexity data, suitably defined. Given i.i.d.~data generated from a simple programming language, the minimum description length (MDL) feedforward neural network which interpolates the data generalizes with high probability. We define this simple programming language, along with a notion of description length of such networks. We provide several examples on basic computational tasks, such as checking primality of a natural number. For primality testing, our theorem shows the following and more. Suppose that we draw an i.i.d.~sample of $n$ numbers uniformly at random from $1$ to $N$. For each number $x_i$, let $y_i = 1$ if $x_i$ is a prime and $0$ if it is not. Then, the interpolating MDL network accurately answers, with probability $1- O((\ln N)/n)$, whether a newly drawn number between $1$ and $N$ is a prime or not. Note that the network is not designed to detect primes; minimum description learning discovers a network which does so. Extensions to noisy data are also discussed, suggesting that MDL neural network interpolators can demonstrate tempered overfitting.

Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable success, including in the open-source community, with many open-weight models available. However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the mobile app market underscores the importance of constant innovation and rapid response to user demands. As user satisfaction is paramount to the success of a mobile application (app), developers typically rely on user reviews, which represent user feedback that includes ratings and comments to identify areas for improvement. However, the sheer volume of user reviews poses challenges in manual analysis, necessitating automated approaches. Existing automated approaches either analyze only the target apps reviews, neglecting the comparison of similar features to competitors or fail to provide suggestions for feature enhancement. To address these gaps, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Competitive User Review Analysis for Feature Enhancement) (LLM-Cure), an approach powered by LLMs to automatically generate suggestion s for mobile app feature improvements. More specifically, LLM-Cure identifies and categorizes features within reviews by applying LLMs. When provided with a complaint in a user review, LLM-Cure curates highly rated (4 and 5 stars) reviews in competing apps related to the complaint and proposes potential improvements tailored to the target application. We evaluate LLM-Cure on 1,056,739 reviews of 70 popular Android apps. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLM-Cure significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in assigning features to reviews by up to 13% in F1-score, up to 16% in recall and up to 11% in precision. Additionally, LLM-Cure demonstrates its capability to provide suggestions for resolving user complaints. We verify the suggestions using the release notes that reflect the changes of features in the target mobile app. LLM-Cure achieves a promising average of 73% of the implementation of the provided suggestions.

<title>Center-fixing of tropical cyclones using uncertainty-aware deep learning applied to high-temporal-resolution geostationary satellite imagery</title>

Abstract: Determining the location of a tropical cyclone's (TC) surface circulation center -- "center-fixing" -- is a critical first step in the TC-forecasting process, affecting current/future estimates of track, intensity, and structure. Despite a recent increase in automated center-fixing methods, only one such method (ARCHER-2) is operational, and its best performance is achieved when using microwave or scatterometer data, which are often unavailable. We develop a deep-learning algorithm called GeoCenter; besides a few scalars in the operational Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting System, it relies only on geostationary infrared (IR) satellite imagery, which is available for all TC basins at high frequency (10 min) and low latency (< 10 min) during both day and night. GeoCenter ingests an animation (time series) of IR images, including 9 channels at lag times up to 4 hours. The animation is centered at a "first guess" location, offset from the true TC-center location by 48 km on average and sometimes > 100 km; GeoCenter is tasked with correcting this offset. On an independent testing dataset, GeoCenter achieves a mean/median/RMS (root mean square) error of 26.6/22.2/32.4 km for all systems, 24.7/20.8/30.0 km for tropical systems, and 14.6/12.5/17.3 km for category-2--5 hurricanes. These values are similar to ARCHER-2 errors with microwave or scatterometer data, and better than ARCHER-2 errors when only IR data are available. GeoCenter also performs skillful uncertainty quantification, producing a well calibrated ensemble of 150 TC-center locations. Furthermore, all predictors used by GeoCenter are available in real time, which would make GeoCenter easy to implement operationally every 10 min.

<title>Efficient Length-Generalizable Attention via Causal Retrieval for Long-Context Language Modeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01651</link>

arXiv:2410.01651v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the success of Transformers, handling long contexts remains challenging due to the limited length generalization and quadratic complexity of self-attention. Thus Transformers often require post-training with a larger attention window, significantly increasing computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on dynamic context, Grouped Cross Attention (GCA), which can generalize to 1000 times the pre-training context length while maintaining the ability to access distant information with a constant attention window size. For a given input sequence, we split it into chunks and use each chunk to retrieve top-k relevant past chunks for subsequent text generation. Specifically, unlike most previous works that use an off-the-shelf retriever, our key innovation allows the retriever to learn how to retrieve past chunks that better minimize the auto-regressive loss of subsequent tokens in an end-to-end manner. Such a mechanism accommodates retrieved chunks with a fixed-size attention window to achieve long-range information access, significantly reducing computational and memory costs during training and inference. Experiments show that GCA-based models achieve near-perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval for 16M context lengths, which is 1000 times the training length.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed them from basic conversational tools into sophisticated entities capable of complex reasoning and decision-making. These advancements have led to the development of specialized LLM-based agents designed for diverse tasks such as coding and web browsing. As these agents become more capable, the need for a robust framework that facilitates global communication and collaboration among them towards advanced objectives has become increasingly critical. Distributed Agents in a Worldwide Network (DAWN) addresses this need by offering a versatile framework that integrates LLM-based agents with traditional software systems, enabling the creation of agentic applications suited for a wide range of use cases. DAWN enables distributed agents worldwide to register and be easily discovered through Gateway Agents. Collaborations among these agents are coordinated by a Principal Agent equipped with reasoning strategies. DAWN offers three operational modes: No-LLM Mode for deterministic tasks, Copilot for augmented decision-making, and LLM Agent for autonomous operations. Additionally, DAWN ensures the safety and security of agent collaborations globally through a dedicated safety, security, and compliance layer, protecting the network against attackers and adhering to stringent security and compliance standards. These features make DAWN a robust network for deploying agent-based applications across various industries.

Abstract: The principles of automation and innovation serve as foundational elements for advancement in contemporary science and technology. Here, we introduce Pygen, an automation platform designed to empower researchers, technologists, and hobbyists to bring abstract ideas to life as core, usable software tools written in Python. Pygen leverages the immense power of autoregressive large language models to augment human creativity during the ideation, iteration, and innovation process. By combining state-of-the-art language models with open-source code generation technologies, Pygen has significantly reduced the manual overhead of tool development. From a user prompt, Pygen automatically generates Python packages for a complete workflow from concept to package generation and documentation. The findings of our work show that Pygen considerably enhances the researcher's productivity by enabling the creation of resilient, modular, and well-documented packages for various specialized purposes. We employ a prompt enhancement approach to distill the user's package description into increasingly specific and actionable. While being inherently an open-ended task, we have evaluated the generated packages and the documentation using Human Evaluation, LLM-based evaluation, and CodeBLEU, with detailed results in the results section. Furthermore, we documented our results, analyzed the limitations, and suggested strategies to alleviate them. Pygen is our vision of ethical automation, a framework that promotes inclusivity, accessibility, and collaborative development. This project marks the beginning of a large-scale effort towards creating tools where intelligent agents collaborate with humans to improve scientific and technological development substantially.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant persuasive capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges, remains underexplored. This paper addresses the research question: \emph{Can LLMs generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?}
  To answer this, we propose a pipeline using reinforcement learning with simulated feedback, where the network's response to LLM-generated content (i.e., the reward) is simulated through a formal engagement model. This approach bypasses the temporal cost and complexity of live experiments, enabling an efficient feedback loop between the LLM and the network under study. It also allows to control over endogenous factors such as the LLM's position within the social network and the distribution of opinions on a given topic. Our approach is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. Such flexibility makes it suitable for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.
  Using our framework, we analyze the performance of LLMs in generating social engagement under different conditions, showcasing their full potential in this task. The experimental code is publicly available at https://github.com/mminici/Engagement-Driven-Content-Generation.

Abstract: As the outputs of generative AI (GenAI) techniques improve in quality, it becomes increasingly challenging to distinguish them from human-created content. Watermarking schemes are a promising approach to address the problem of distinguishing between AI and human-generated content. These schemes embed hidden signals within AI-generated content to enable reliable detection. While watermarking is not a silver bullet for addressing all risks associated with GenAI, it can play a crucial role in enhancing AI safety and trustworthiness by combating misinformation and deception. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of watermarking techniques for GenAI, beginning with the need for watermarking from historical and regulatory perspectives. We formalize the definitions and desired properties of watermarking schemes and examine the key objectives and threat models for existing approaches. Practical evaluation strategies are also explored, providing insights into the development of robust watermarking techniques capable of resisting various attacks. Additionally, we review recent representative works, highlight open challenges, and discuss potential directions for this emerging field. By offering a thorough understanding of watermarking in GenAI, this work aims to guide researchers in advancing watermarking methods and applications, and support policymakers in addressing the broader implications of GenAI.

arXiv:2412.14218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to address distributed channel access in wireless local area networks. In particular, we consider the challenging yet more practical case where the agents heterogeneously adopt value-based or policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms to train the model. We propose a heterogeneous MARL training framework, named QPMIX, which adopts a centralized training with distributed execution paradigm to enable heterogeneous agents to collaborate. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence of the proposed heterogeneous MARL method when using the linear value function approximation. Our method maximizes the network throughput and ensures fairness among stations, therefore, enhancing the overall network performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed QPMIX algorithm improves throughput, mean delay, delay jitter, and collision rates compared with conventional carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism in the saturated traffic scenario. Furthermore, the QPMIX algorithm is robust in unsaturated and delay-sensitive traffic scenarios. It coexists well with the conventional CSMA/CA mechanism and promotes cooperation among heterogeneous agents.

arXiv:2501.02330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning reward functions directly from offline demonstrations. Unlike traditional inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), our approach decouples the reward function from the learner's policy, eliminating the adversarial interaction typically required between the two. This results in a more stable and efficient training process. Our reward function, called \textit{SR-Reward}, leverages successor representation (SR) to encode a state based on expected future states' visitation under the demonstration policy and transition dynamics. By utilizing the Bellman equation, SR-Reward can be learned concurrently with most reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms without altering the existing training pipeline. We also introduce a negative sampling strategy to mitigate overestimation errors by reducing rewards for out-of-distribution data, thereby enhancing robustness. This strategy inherently introduces a conservative bias into RL algorithms that employ the learned reward. We evaluate our method on the D4RL benchmark, achieving competitive results compared to offline RL algorithms with access to true rewards and imitation learning (IL) techniques like behavioral cloning. Moreover, our ablation studies on data size and quality reveal the advantages and limitations of SR-Reward as a proxy for true rewards.

<title>Latent Action Learning Requires Supervision in the Presence of Distractors</title>

arXiv:2502.00379v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, latent action learning, pioneered by Latent Action Policies (LAPO), have shown remarkable pre-training efficiency on observation-only data, offering potential for leveraging vast amounts of video available on the web for embodied AI. However, prior work has focused on distractor-free data, where changes between observations are primarily explained by ground-truth actions. Unfortunately, real-world videos contain action-correlated distractors that may hinder latent action learning. Using Distracting Control Suite (DCS) we empirically investigate the effect of distractors on latent action learning and demonstrate that LAPO struggle in such scenario. We propose LAOM, a simple LAPO modification that improves the quality of latent actions by 8x, as measured by linear probing. Importantly, we show that providing supervision with ground-truth actions, as few as 2.5% of the full dataset, during latent action learning improves downstream performance by 4.2x on average. Our findings suggest that integrating supervision during Latent Action Models (LAM) training is critical in the presence of distractors, challenging the conventional pipeline of first learning LAM and only then decoding from latent to ground-truth actions.

<title>Upweighting Easy Samples in Fine-Tuning Mitigates Forgetting</title>

arXiv:2502.02797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning a pre-trained model on a downstream task often degrades its original capabilities, a phenomenon known as "catastrophic forgetting". This is especially an issue when one does not have access to the data and recipe used to develop the pre-trained model. Under this constraint, most existing methods for mitigating forgetting are inapplicable. To address this challenge, we propose a sample weighting scheme for the fine-tuning data solely based on the pre-trained model's losses. Specifically, we upweight the easy samples on which the pre-trained model's loss is low and vice versa to limit the drift from the pre-trained model. Our approach is orthogonal and yet complementary to existing methods; while such methods mostly operate on parameter or gradient space, we concentrate on the sample space. We theoretically analyze the impact of fine-tuning with our method in a linear setting, showing that it stalls learning in a certain subspace which inhibits overfitting to the target task. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our method on both language and vision tasks. As an example, when fine-tuning Gemma 2 2B on MetaMathQA, our method results in only a $0.8\%$ drop in accuracy on GSM8K (another math dataset) compared to standard fine-tuning, while preserving $5.4\%$ more accuracy on the pre-training datasets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/sanyalsunny111/FLOW_finetuning .

Abstract: As Language Model (LM) capabilities advance, evaluating and supervising them at scale is getting harder for humans. There is hope that other language models can automate both these tasks, which we refer to as ''AI Oversight''. We study how model similarity affects both aspects of AI oversight by proposing Chance Adjusted Probabilistic Agreement (CAPA): a metric for LM similarity based on overlap in model mistakes. Using CAPA, we first show that LLM-as-a-judge scores favor models similar to the judge, generalizing recent self-preference results. Then, we study training on LM annotations, and find complementary knowledge between the weak supervisor and strong student model plays a crucial role in gains from ''weak-to-strong generalization''. As model capabilities increase, it becomes harder to find their mistakes, and we might defer more to AI oversight. However, we observe a concerning trend -- model mistakes are becoming more similar with increasing capabilities, pointing to risks from correlated failures. Our work underscores the importance of reporting and correcting for model similarity, especially in the emerging paradigm of AI oversight.

<title>Prompt-based Depth Pruning of Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2502.04348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Depth pruning aims to reduce the inference cost of a large language model without any hardware-specific complications, by simply removing several less important transformer blocks. However, our empirical findings suggest that the importance of a transformer block may be highly task-dependent -- a block that is crucial for a task can be removed without degrading the accuracy on another task. Based on this observation, we develop a dynamic depth pruning algorithm, coined PuDDing (Prompt-routed Dynamic Depth Pruning), which determines which blocks to omit from the model based on the input prompt. PuDDing operates by training a lightweight router to predict the best omission set among a set of options, where this option set has also been constructed in a data-driven manner. Empirical results on commonsense reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PuDDing effectively accelerates the inference language models, and achieves better on-task performance than static depth pruning baselines.

<title>Implicit Language Models are RNNs: Balancing Parallelization and Expressivity</title>

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) and transformers dominate the language modeling landscape. However, they are constrained to a lower computational complexity than classical recurrent neural networks (RNNs), limiting their expressivity. In contrast, RNNs lack parallelization during training, raising fundamental questions about the trade off between parallelization and expressivity. We propose implicit SSMs, which iterate a transformation until convergence to a fixed point. Theoretically, we show that implicit SSMs implement the non-linear state-transitions of RNNs. Empirically, we find that only approximate fixed-point convergence suffices, enabling the design of a scalable training curriculum that largely retains parallelization, with full convergence required only for a small subset of tokens. Our approach demonstrates superior state-tracking capabilities on regular languages, surpassing transformers and SSMs. We further scale implicit SSMs to natural language reasoning tasks and pretraining of large-scale language models up to 1.3B parameters on 207B tokens representing, to our knowledge, the largest implicit model trained to date. Notably, our implicit models outperform their explicit counterparts on standard benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at http://github.com/microsoft/implicit_languagemodels .

Abstract: In this paper, we present TransMLA, a framework that seamlessly converts any GQA-based pre-trained model into an MLA-based model. Our approach enables direct compatibility with DeepSeek's codebase, allowing these models to fully leverage DeepSeek-specific optimizations such as vLLM and SGlang. By compressing 93% of the KV cache in LLaMA-2-7B, TransMLA achieves a 10.6x inference speedup at an 8K context length while preserving meaningful output quality. Additionally, the model requires only 6 billion tokens for fine-tuning to regain performance on par with the original across multiple benchmarks. TransMLA offers a practical solution for migrating GQA-based models to the MLA structure. When combined with DeepSeek's advanced features, such as FP8 quantization and Multi-Token Prediction, even greater inference acceleration can be realized.

Abstract: In an era overwhelmed by vast amounts of data, the effective curation of web-crawl datasets is essential for optimizing model performance. This paper tackles the challenges associated with the unstructured and heterogeneous nature of such datasets. Traditional heuristic curation methods often inadequately capture complex features, resulting in biases and the exclusion of relevant data. We introduce an advanced, learning-driven approach, Ensemble Curation Of DAta ThroUgh Multimodal Operators (EcoDatum), incorporating a novel quality-guided deduplication method to ensure balanced feature distributions. EcoDatum strategically integrates various unimodal and multimodal data curation operators within a weak supervision ensemble framework, utilizing automated optimization to score each data point effectively. EcoDatum, which significantly improves the data curation quality and efficiency, outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques, ranked 1st on the DataComp leaderboard, with an average performance score of 0.182 across 38 diverse evaluation datasets. This represents a 28% improvement over the DataComp baseline method, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving dataset curation and model training efficiency.

Abstract: Leveraging vast amounts of unlabeled internet video data for embodied AI is currently bottlenecked by the lack of action labels and the presence of action-correlated visual distractors. Although recent latent action policy optimization (LAPO) has shown promise in inferring proxy-action labels from visual observations, its performance degrades significantly when distractors are present. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric latent action learning framework that centers on objects rather than pixels. We leverage self-supervised object-centric pretraining to disentangle action-related and distracting dynamics. This allows LAPO to focus on task-relevant interactions, resulting in more robust proxy-action labels, enabling better imitation learning and efficient adaptation of the agent with just a few action-labeled trajectories. We evaluated our method in eight visually complex tasks across the Distracting Control Suite (DCS) and Distracting MetaWorld (DMW). Our results show that object-centric pretraining mitigates the negative effects of distractors by 50%, as measured by downstream task performance: average return (DCS) and success rate (DMW).

Abstract: Feature interaction is crucial in predictive machine learning models, as it captures the relationships between features that influence model performance. In this work, we focus on pairwise interactions and investigate their importance in constructing feature graphs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We leverage existing GNN models and tools to explore the relationship between feature graph structures and their effectiveness in modeling interactions. Through experiments on synthesized datasets, we uncover that edges between interacting features are important for enabling GNNs to model feature interactions effectively. We also observe that including non-interaction edges can act as noise, degrading model performance. Furthermore, we provide theoretical support for sparse feature graph selection using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We prove that feature graphs retaining only necessary interaction edges yield a more efficient and interpretable representation than complete graphs, aligning with Occam's Razor. Our findings offer both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for designing feature graphs that improve the performance and interpretability of GNN models.

Abstract: Recent copyright agreements between AI companies and content creators underscore the need for fine-grained control over language models' ability to reproduce copyrighted text. Existing defenses-ranging from aggressive unlearning to simplistic output filters-either sacrifice model utility or inadequately address verbatim leakage. We introduce Obliviate, a lightweight post-training method that surgically suppresses exact reproduction of specified sequences while preserving semantic understanding. Obliviate first identifies memorized passages and then, for each target token, minimally adjusts the model's output distribution via a Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty to drive down the probability of exact reproduction. Simultaneously, we enforce a consistency loss on non-target tokens to retain the model's fluency and task performance. We evaluate Obliviate on four popular 6-8B-parameter models (LLaMA-3.1, LLaMA-3.1-Instruct, Qwen-2.5, and Yi-1.5) using synthetic memorization benchmarks and organic copyrighted excerpts (e.g., Moby Dick, Frankenstein, Alice in Wonderland and Les Miserables). Across all settings, Obliviate reduces verbatim recall by two orders of magnitude (e.g., from hundreds of words to fewer than 12) while degrading downstream accuracy by at most 1% on HellaSwag, MMLU, TruthfulQA, and Winogrande. Furthermore, we benchmark Obliviate aganist different unlearning and copyright techniques using the MUSE and CoTaEval benchmarks. These results position Obliviate as a practical, high-fidelity solution for copyright compliance in deployed LLMs.

Abstract: Human activity is moderated by norms; however, supervision for normative reasoning is sparse, particularly where norms are physically- or socially-grounded. We thus present EGONORMIA $\|\epsilon\|$, comprising 1,853 (200 for EGONORMIA-verified) multiple choice questions (MCQs) grounded within egocentric videos of human interactions, enabling the evaluation and improvement of normative reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs). EGONORMIA spans seven norm categories: safety, privacy, proxemics, politeness, cooperation, coordination/proactivity, and communication/legibility. To compile this dataset at scale, we propose a novel pipeline to generate grounded MCQs from raw egocentric video. Our work demonstrates that current state-of-the-art VLMs lack robust grounded norm understanding, scoring a maximum of 54% on EGONORMIA and 65% on EGONORMIA-verified, with performance across norm categories indicating significant risks of safety and privacy when VLMs are used in real-world agents. We additionally explore methods for improving normative understanding, demonstrating that a naive retrieval-based generation (RAG) method using EGONORMIA can enhance normative reasoning in VLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently driven significant breakthroughs in generative modeling. While state-of-the-art models produce high-quality samples on average, individual samples can still be low quality. Detecting such samples without human inspection remains a challenging task. To address this, we propose a Bayesian framework for estimating generative uncertainty of synthetic samples. We outline how to make Bayesian inference practical for large, modern generative models and introduce a new semantic likelihood (evaluated in the latent space of a feature extractor) to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional sample spaces. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed generative uncertainty effectively identifies poor-quality samples and significantly outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods. Notably, our Bayesian framework can be applied post-hoc to any pretrained diffusion or flow matching model (via the Laplace approximation), and we propose simple yet effective techniques to minimize its computational overhead during sampling.

<title>An energy-efficient learning solution for the Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem</title>

Abstract: The Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP) entails finding the subset of observation targets to be scheduled along the satellite's orbit while meeting operational constraints of time, energy and memory. The problem of deciding what and when to observe is inherently complex, and becomes even more challenging when considering several issues that compromise the quality of the captured images, such as cloud occlusion, atmospheric turbulence, and image resolution. This paper presents a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approach for addressing the AEOSSP with time-dependent profits, integrating these three factors to optimize the use of energy and memory resources. The proposed method involves a dual decision-making process: selecting the sequence of targets and determining the optimal observation time for each. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the capture of images that fail to meet quality requirements by > 60% and consequently decreases energy waste from attitude maneuvers by up to 78%, all while maintaining strong observation performance.

Abstract: Measuring social bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial, but existing bias evaluation methods struggle to assess bias in long-form generation. We propose a Bias Benchmark for Generation (BBG), an adaptation of the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), designed to evaluate social bias in long-form generation by having LLMs generate continuations of story prompts. Building our benchmark in English and Korean, we measure the probability of neutral and biased generations across ten LLMs. We also compare our long-form story generation evaluation results with multiple-choice BBQ evaluation, showing that the two approaches produce inconsistent results.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to outpatient referral tasks across healthcare systems. However, there is a lack of standardized evaluation criteria to assess their effectiveness, particularly in dynamic, interactive scenarios. In this study, we systematically examine the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in managing tasks within Intelligent Outpatient Referral (IOR) systems and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework specifically designed for such systems. This framework comprises two core tasks: static evaluation, which focuses on evaluating the ability of predefined outpatient referrals, and dynamic evaluation, which evaluates capabilities of refining outpatient referral recommendations through iterative dialogues. Our findings suggest that LLMs offer limited advantages over BERT-like models, but show promise in asking effective questions during interactive dialogues.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is increasingly adopted in various academic and commercial applications due to its real-time and high-quality rendering capabilities, emphasizing the growing need for copyright protection technologies for 3DGS. However, the large model size of 3DGS requires developing efficient compression techniques. This highlights the necessity of an integrated framework that addresses copyright protection and data compression for 3D content. Nevertheless, existing 3DGS watermarking methods significantly degrade watermark performance under 3DGS compression methods, particularly quantization-based approaches that achieve superior compression performance. To ensure reliable watermark detection under compression, we propose a compression-tolerant anchor-based 3DGS watermarking, which preserves watermark integrity and rendering quality. This is achieved by introducing anchor-based 3DGS watermarking. We embed the watermark into the anchor attributes, particularly the anchor feature, to enhance security and rendering quality. We also propose a quantization distortion layer that injects quantization noise during training, preserving the watermark after quantization-based compression. Moreover, we employ a frequency-aware anchor growing strategy that improves rendering quality and watermark performance by effectively identifying Gaussians in high-frequency regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method preserves the watermark even under compression and maintains high rendering quality.

<title>Computation Mechanism Behind LLM Position Generalization</title>

Abstract: Most written natural languages are composed of sequences of words and sentences. Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.

arXiv:2503.14432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with specialized external tools, yet many tasks demand zero-shot tool usage with minimal or noisy documentation. Existing solutions rely on manual rewriting or labeled data for validation, making them inapplicable in true zero-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose PLAY2PROMPT, an automated framework that systematically "plays" with each tool to explore its input-output behaviors. Through this iterative trial-and-error process, PLAY2PROMPT refines tool documentation and generates usage examples without any labeled data. These examples not only guide LLM inference but also serve as validation to further enhance tool utilization. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that PLAY2PROMPT significantly improves zero-shot tool performance across both open and closed models, offering a scalable and effective solution for domain-specific tool integration.

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has sparked significant debate over balancing the interests of creative rightsholders and AI developers. As GenAI models are trained on vast datasets that often include copyrighted material, questions around fair compensation and proper attribution have become increasingly urgent. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework called Content ARCs (Authenticity, Rights, Compensation). By combining open standards for provenance and dynamic licensing with data attribution, and decentralized technologies, Content ARCs create a mechanism for managing rights and compensating creators for using their work in AI training. We characterize several nascent works in the AI data licensing space within Content ARCs and identify where challenges remain to fully implement the end-to-end framework.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as mainstream framework in visual generation. Building upon this success, the integration of Mixture of Experts (MoE) methods has shown promise in enhancing model scalability and performance. In this paper, we introduce Race-DiT, a novel MoE model for diffusion transformers with a flexible routing strategy, Expert Race. By allowing tokens and experts to compete together and select the top candidates, the model learns to dynamically assign experts to critical tokens. Additionally, we propose per-layer regularization to address challenges in shallow layer learning, and router similarity loss to prevent mode collapse, ensuring better expert utilization. Extensive experiments on ImageNet validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing significant performance gains while promising scaling properties.

arXiv:2504.02169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall (PR) curves in binary classification problems. The key finding is that many of the most commonly used binary classification metrics are merely functions of the composition function $G := F_p \circ F_n^{-1}$, where $F_p(\cdot)$ and $F_n(\cdot)$ are the class-conditional cumulative distribution functions of the classifier scores in the positive and negative classes, respectively. This geometric perspective facilitates the selection of operating points, understanding the effect of decision thresholds, and comparison between classifiers. It also helps explain how the shapes and geometry of ROC/PR curves reflect classifier behavior, providing objective tools for building classifiers optimized for specific applications with context-specific constraints. We further explore the conditions for classifier dominance, present analytical and numerical examples demonstrating the effects of class separability and variance on ROC and PR geometries, and derive a link between the positive-to-negative class leakage function $G(\cdot)$ and the Kullback--Leibler divergence. The framework highlights practical considerations, such as model calibration, cost-sensitive optimization, and operating point selection under real-world capacity constraints, enabling more informed approaches to classifier deployment and decision-making.

arXiv:2504.11343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.

Abstract: Multimodal protein language models (PLMs) integrate sequence and token-based structural information, serving as a powerful foundation for protein modeling, generation, and design. However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into discrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained structural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have led to their application in password guessing, with the aim of replicating the complexity, structure, and patterns of human-created passwords. Despite their potential, inconsistencies and inadequate evaluation methodologies in prior research have hindered meaningful comparisons and a comprehensive, unbiased understanding of their capabilities. This paper introduces MAYA, a unified, customizable, plug-and-play benchmarking framework designed to facilitate the systematic characterization and benchmarking of generative password-guessing models in the context of trawling attacks. Using MAYA, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of six state-of-the-art approaches, which we re-implemented and adapted to ensure standardization. Our evaluation spans eight real-world password datasets and covers an exhaustive set of advanced testing scenarios, totaling over 15,000 compute hours. Our findings indicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover, the diverse password distributions learned by the models enable a multi-model attack that outperforms the best individual model. By releasing MAYA, we aim to foster further research, providing the community with a new tool to consistently and reliably benchmark generative password-guessing models. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/williamcorrias/MAYA-Password-Benchmarking.

Abstract: We propose reinforcement learning (RL) strategies tailored for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) under strict memory and compute limits, with a particular focus on compatibility with LoRA fine-tuning. Building on early policy gradient methods with baseline subtraction, we design critic-free methods that operate on a small, informative subset of output tokens to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. We introduce S-GRPO, a stochastic variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, and T-SPMO, a token-level prefix matching approach for fine-grained credit assignment. Applied to Qwen2-1.5B, our methods raise accuracy on the SVAMP benchmark from 46% to over 70% and show strong performance on multi-digit multiplication. Surprisingly, full-token GRPO under LoRA fails to improve over the base model, suggesting that selective token-level optimization may act as an implicit regularizer in low-parameter training regimes.

Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.

Abstract: The emergence of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (HQML) models opens new horizons of computational intelligence but their fundamental complexity frequently leads to black box behavior that undermines transparency and reliability in their application. Although XAI for quantum systems still in its infancy, a major research gap is evident in robust global and local explainability approaches that are designed for HQML architectures that employ quantized feature encoding followed by classical learning. The gap is the focus of this work, which introduces QuXAI, an framework based upon Q-MEDLEY, an explainer for explaining feature importance in these hybrid systems. Our model entails the creation of HQML models incorporating quantum feature maps, the use of Q-MEDLEY, which combines feature based inferences, preserving the quantum transformation stage and visualizing the resulting attributions. Our result shows that Q-MEDLEY delineates influential classical aspects in HQML models, as well as separates their noise, and competes well against established XAI techniques in classical validation settings. Ablation studies more significantly expose the virtues of the composite structure used in Q-MEDLEY. The implications of this work are critically important, as it provides a route to improve the interpretability and reliability of HQML models, thus promoting greater confidence and being able to engage in safer and more responsible use of quantum-enhanced AI technology.

arXiv:2505.11695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Qronos -- a new state-of-the-art post-training quantization algorithm that sequentially rounds and updates neural network weights. Qronos not only explicitly corrects errors due to both weight and activation quantization, but also errors resulting from quantizing previous layers. Our iterative algorithm is based on an interpretable and disciplined optimization framework that subsumes and surpasses existing data-driven approaches. At each step, Qronos alternates between error correction and diffusion via optimal update rules. Importantly, we prove that Qronos admits an efficient implementation that uses the Cholesky decomposition for solving least-squares problems. We also demonstrate that Qronos is compatible with existing transformation techniques such as Hadamard-based incoherence processing and weight-activation scaling equalization, among others. We evaluate Qronos using recent autoregressive language generation models in the Llama3 family; Qronos consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art adaptive rounding methods when quantizing the weights, activations, and/or KV caches.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning Finetuning (RFT) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by enabling long chains of thought, self-correction, and effective tool use. While recent works attempt to extend RFT to vision-language models (VLMs), these efforts largely produce text-only reasoning conditioned on static image inputs, falling short of true multimodal reasoning in the response. In contrast, test-time methods like Visual Sketchpad incorporate visual steps but lack training mechanisms.
  We introduce VTool-R1, the first framework that trains VLMs to generate multimodal chains of thought by interleaving text and intermediate visual reasoning steps. VTool-R1 integrates Python-based visual editing tools into the RFT process, enabling VLMs to learn when and how to generate visual reasoning steps that benefit final reasoning. Trained with outcome-based rewards tied to task accuracy, our approach elicits strategic visual tool use for reasoning without relying on process-based supervision. Experiments on structured visual question answering over charts and tables show that VTool-R1 enhances reasoning performance by teaching VLMs to "think with images" and generate multimodal chain of thoughts with tools.

Abstract: AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based upon principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is fundamentally classical in nature - as are the environments in which it is modelled. Given the universe is quantum mechanical in nature and the exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical systems classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical analogues of AIXI. To address this question, we extend the framework to quantum information and present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce a model of quantum agent/environment interaction based upon quantum and classical registers and channels, showing how quantum AIXI agents may take both classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components of AIXI in quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations upon quantum Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally affects QAIXI models.

Abstract: Graph Representation Learning (GRL) is a fundamental task in machine learning, aiming to encode high-dimensional graph-structured data into low-dimensional vectors. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods are widely used in GRL because they can avoid expensive human annotation. In this work, we propose a novel Subgraph Gaussian Embedding Contrast (SubGEC) method. Our approach introduces a subgraph Gaussian embedding module, which adaptively maps subgraphs to a structured Gaussian space, ensuring the preservation of input subgraph characteristics while generating subgraphs with a controlled distribution. We then employ optimal transport distances, more precisely the Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein distances, to effectively measure the similarity between subgraphs, enhancing the robustness of the contrastive learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that \method~outperforms or presents competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Our findings provide insights into the design of SSL methods for GRL, emphasizing the importance of the distribution of the generated contrastive pairs.

<title>SealQA: Raising the Bar for Reasoning in Search-Augmented Language Models</title>

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

<title>Incentivizing Reasoning for Advanced Instruction-Following of Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01413</link>

arXiv:2506.01413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First, we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries. However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory. Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative capabilities for hardware design automation, particularly in Verilog code generation. However, they also pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in LLM-aided hardware design.

Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Abstract: Test-time scaling paradigms have significantly advanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. Despite their empirical success, theoretical understanding of the sample efficiency of various test-time strategies -- such as self-consistency, best-of-$n$, and self-correction -- remains limited. In this work, we first establish a separation result between two repeated sampling strategies: self-consistency requires $\Theta(1/\Delta^2)$ samples to produce the correct answer, while best-of-$n$ only needs $\Theta(1/\Delta)$, where $\Delta < 1$ denotes the probability gap between the correct and second most likely answers. Next, we present an expressiveness result for the self-correction approach with verifier feedback: it enables Transformers to simulate online learning over a pool of experts at test time. Therefore, a single Transformer architecture can provably solve multiple tasks without prior knowledge of the specific task associated with a user query, extending the representation theory of Transformers from single-task to multi-task settings. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical results, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of self-correction methods.

<title>Q-Ponder: A Unified Training Pipeline for Reasoning-based Visual Quality Assessment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05384</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.05384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can proficiently evaluate visual quality through interpretable assessments. However, existing approaches typically treat quality scoring and reasoning descriptions as separate tasks with disjoint optimization objectives, leading to a trade-off: models adept at quality reasoning descriptions struggle with precise score regression, while score-focused models lack interpretability. This limitation hinders the full potential of MLLMs in visual quality assessment, where accuracy and interpretability should be mutually reinforcing. To address this, we propose a unified two-stage training framework comprising a cold-start stage and a reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning stage. Specifically, in the first stage, we distill high-quality data from a teacher model through expert-designed prompts, initializing reasoning capabilities via cross-entropy loss supervision. In the second stage, we introduce a novel reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize scoring accuracy and reasoning consistency. We designate the models derived from these two stages as Q-Ponder-CI and Q-Ponder. Extensive experiments show that Q-Ponder achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on quality score regression benchmarks, delivering up to 6.5% higher SRCC on cross-domain datasets. Furthermore, Q-Ponder significantly outperforms description-based SOTA models, including its teacher model Qwen-2.5-VL-72B, particularly in description accuracy and reasonableness, demonstrating the generalization potential over diverse tasks.

Abstract: The development of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, particularly diffusion-based models employed in computer vision and image generation tasks, is undergoing a paradigmatic shift in development methodologies. Traditionally dominated by a "Model Centric" approach, in which performance gains were primarily pursued through increasingly complex model architectures and hyperparameter optimization, the field is now recognizing a more nuanced "Data-Centric" approach. This emergent framework foregrounds the quality, structure, and relevance of training data as the principal driver of model performance. To operationalize this paradigm shift, we introduce the DataSeeds.AI sample dataset (the "DSD"), initially comprised of approximately 10,610 high-quality human peer-ranked photography images accompanied by extensive multi-tier annotations. The DSD is a foundational computer vision dataset designed to usher in a new standard for commercial image datasets. Representing a small fraction of DataSeeds.AI's 100 million-plus image catalog, the DSD provides a scalable foundation necessary for robust commercial and multimodal AI development. Through this in-depth exploratory analysis, we document the quantitative improvements generated by the DSD on specific models against known benchmarks and make the code and the trained models used in our evaluation publicly available.

Abstract: This chapter explores advancements in decoding strategies for large language models (LLMs), focusing on enhancing the Locally Typical Sampling (LTS) algorithm. Traditional decoding methods, such as top-k and nucleus sampling, often struggle to balance fluency, diversity, and coherence in text generation. To address these challenges, Adaptive Semantic-Aware Typicality Sampling (ASTS) is proposed as an improved version of LTS, incorporating dynamic entropy thresholding, multi-objective scoring, and reward-penalty adjustments. ASTS ensures contextually coherent and diverse text generation while maintaining computational efficiency. Its performance is evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including story generation and abstractive summarization, using metrics such as perplexity, MAUVE, and diversity scores. Experimental results demonstrate that ASTS outperforms existing sampling techniques by reducing repetition, enhancing semantic alignment, and improving fluency.

Summary: Extended reality (XR) systems, including VR, AR, and XR, are enhanced by multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs). These models combine the strengths of M3T foundation models with federated learning principles to improve XR capabilities while maintaining privacy. A modular architecture for FedFMs facilitates model training and aggregation, addressing challenges posed by the SHIFT dimensions: sensor and modality diversity, hardware heterogeneity, interactivity, functional variability, and temporality. These dimensions are crucial for implementing FedFMs in XR applications. Evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs are essential for developing resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective lays the groundwork for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the future of XR systems. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Extended reality (XR) systems, which consist of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (XR), offer a transformative interface for immersive, multi-modal, and embodied human-computer interaction. In this paper, we envision that multi-modal multi-task (M3T) federated foundation models (FedFMs) can offer transformative capabilities for XR systems through integrating the representational strength of M3T foundation models (FMs) with the privacy-preserving model training principles of federated learning (FL). We present a modular architecture for FedFMs, which entails different coordination paradigms for model training and aggregations. Central to our vision is the codification of XR challenges that affect the implementation of FedFMs under the SHIFT dimensions: (1) Sensor and modality diversity, (2) Hardware heterogeneity and system-level constraints, (3) Interactivity and embodied personalization, (4) Functional/task variability, and (5) Temporality and environmental variability. We illustrate the manifestation of these dimensions across a set of emerging and anticipated applications of XR systems. Finally, we propose evaluation metrics, dataset requirements, and design tradeoffs necessary for the development of resource-aware FedFMs in XR. This perspective aims to chart the technical and conceptual foundations for context-aware privacy-preserving intelligence in the next generation of XR systems.

Summary:<br />
Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to learn behaviors through human interventions. The Adaptive Intervention Mechanism (AIM) is introduced as a robot-gated IIL algorithm that adapts intervention requests based on agent alignment with human actions. AIM uses a proxy Q-function to mimic human intervention rules and assess real-time alignment with the expert, reducing the cognitive burden on human supervisors. Expert-in-the-loop experiments showed that AIM significantly decreases expert monitoring efforts in continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to Thrifty-DAgger, AIM improves human take-over cost and learning efficiency by 40%. AIM identifies safety-critical states for expert assistance, enhancing the quality of expert demonstrations and reducing expert data and environment interactions required. The code and demo video for AIM are available on GitHub at https://github.com/metadriverse/AIM. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Interactive Imitation Learning (IIL) allows agents to acquire desired behaviors through human interventions, but current methods impose high cognitive demands on human supervisors. We propose the Adaptive Intervention Mechanism (AIM), a novel robot-gated IIL algorithm that learns an adaptive criterion for requesting human demonstrations. AIM utilizes a proxy Q-function to mimic the human intervention rule and adjusts intervention requests based on the alignment between agent and human actions. By assigning high Q-values when the agent deviates from the expert and decreasing these values as the agent becomes proficient, the proxy Q-function enables the agent to assess the real-time alignment with the expert and request assistance when needed. Our expert-in-the-loop experiments reveal that AIM significantly reduces expert monitoring efforts in both continuous and discrete control tasks. Compared to the uncertainty-based baseline Thrifty-DAgger, our method achieves a 40% improvement in terms of human take-over cost and learning efficiency. Furthermore, AIM effectively identifies safety-critical states for expert assistance, thereby collecting higher-quality expert demonstrations and reducing overall expert data and environment interactions needed. Code and demo video are available at https://github.com/metadriverse/AIM.

Summary:
Tower of Hanoi experiments in Shojaee et al.'s study often exceeded model output token limits, leading to inaccuracies in reported failure points. The automated evaluation framework used did not adequately differentiate between reasoning failures and practical constraints, resulting in misclassification of model capabilities. Additionally, the River Crossing benchmarks included mathematically impossible instances for N > 5 due to boat capacity limitations, yet models were still scored as failures. When controlling for these experimental artifacts by requesting generating functions instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across various models showed high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously considered failures. These findings emphasize the critical importance of thorough experimental design in accurately evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Shojaee et al. (2025) report that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit "accuracy collapse" on planning puzzles beyond certain complexity thresholds. We demonstrate that their findings primarily reflect experimental design limitations rather than fundamental reasoning failures. Our analysis reveals three critical issues: (1) Tower of Hanoi experiments systematically exceed model output token limits at reported failure points, with models explicitly acknowledging these constraints in their outputs; (2) The authors' automated evaluation framework fails to distinguish between reasoning failures and practical constraints, leading to misclassification of model capabilities; (3) Most concerningly, their River Crossing benchmarks include mathematically impossible instances for N > 5 due to insufficient boat capacity, yet models are scored as failures for not solving these unsolvable problems. When we control for these experimental artifacts, by requesting generating functions instead of exhaustive move lists, preliminary experiments across multiple models indicate high accuracy on Tower of Hanoi instances previously reported as complete failures. These findings highlight the importance of careful experimental design when evaluating AI reasoning capabilities.

Summary: 
<br />
The paper introduces Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model that can process images, text, audio, and video, with a focus on speech and image generation. Ming-Omni utilizes specific encoders for different modalities and Ling, an MoE architecture with modality-specific routers, to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a single framework. It stands out by supporting audio and image generation, including a high-quality image generator and an advanced audio decoder for natural speech. This allows Ming-Omni to engage in various tasks such as context-aware chatting, text-to-speech conversion, and image editing. The experiments show that Ming-Omni matches GPT-4o in modality support and is the first open-source model with such capabilities. The code and model weights are released for further research and development in the community.

Abstract: We propose Ming-Omni, a unified multimodal model capable of processing images, text, audio, and video, while demonstrating strong proficiency in both speech and image generation. Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.

<title>Beyond Nash Equilibrium: Bounded Rationality of LLMs and humans in Strategic Decision-making</title>

<div> Keywords: language models, bounded rationality, strategic games, heuristics, opponent modeling
Summary: 
Language models, both human and artificial, often demonstrate deviations from full rationality in strategic decision-making settings. In this study, researchers compared the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) with humans in strategic games like Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's Dilemma. LLMs exhibited familiar human heuristics such as switching strategies based on outcomes and showing increased cooperation when future interactions were possible. However, their application of these rules was more rigid and less sensitive to dynamic changes in the game environment. Model-level analyses revealed distinct architectural signatures in LLMs' strategic behavior, showing a struggle in finding effective strategies in adaptive situations. The findings suggest that current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality, highlighting the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent modeling and stronger context awareness. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.09390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in strategic decision-making settings, yet evidence shows that, like humans, they often deviate from full rationality. In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental paradigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on two well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's Dilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational play in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions, we evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality characteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human heuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation when future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly and demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game environment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures in strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find effective strategies in adaptive situations. These results indicate that current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality and highlight the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent modeling and stronger context awareness.

<div> Keywords: large language models, autonomy, human-agent systems, collaboration, trustworthiness

Summary: Recent advances in large language models have raised questions about the feasibility of fully autonomous AI agents due to concerns regarding reliability, transparency, and understanding human requirements. The proposed alternative approach suggests the development of LLM-based Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS) where AI collaborates with humans rather than replaces them. By involving humans in tasks such as providing guidance, answering questions, and maintaining control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Examples from various industries demonstrate that human-AI teamwork can outperform AI working independently. The paper emphasizes the importance of measuring AI progress not by the independence of systems, but by their ability to work effectively with humans. It argues that the future of AI lies in enhancing human capabilities through meaningful partnerships rather than replacing human roles. Challenges in building collaborative systems are discussed, along with practical solutions.

Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models (LLMs) have led many researchers to focus on building fully autonomous AI agents. This position paper questions whether this approach is the right path forward, as these autonomous systems still have problems with reliability, transparency, and understanding the actual requirements of human. We suggest a different approach: LLM-based Human-Agent Systems (LLM-HAS), where AI works with humans rather than replacing them. By keeping human involved to provide guidance, answer questions, and maintain control, these systems can be more trustworthy and adaptable. Looking at examples from healthcare, finance, and software development, we show how human-AI teamwork can handle complex tasks better than AI working alone. We also discuss the challenges of building these collaborative systems and offer practical solutions. This paper argues that progress in AI should not be measured by how independent systems become, but by how well they can work with humans. The most promising future for AI is not in systems that take over human roles, but in those that enhance human capabilities through meaningful partnership.

<div> Efficient, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion, Fast-MCTD, trajectory planning, scalability <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces Fast-MCTD, an efficient variant of the Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) model for trajectory planning. While MCTD combines diffusion with tree-based search to achieve high performance, it incurs significant computational overhead. Fast-MCTD addresses this issue by integrating two key techniques: Parallel MCTD enables parallel rollouts through delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection, while Sparse MCTD reduces rollout length by coarsening trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that Fast-MCTD provides up to 100 times speedup compared to standard MCTD, maintaining or improving planning performance. Notably, Fast-MCTD even surpasses the inference speed of Diffuser on some tasks, despite Diffuser not requiring search and producing weaker solutions. The findings highlight Fast-MCTD as a practical and scalable solution for efficient diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful approach for trajectory planning. However, their inherently non-sequential nature limits their effectiveness in long-horizon reasoning tasks at test time. The recently proposed Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD) offers a promising solution by combining diffusion with tree-based search, achieving state-of-the-art performance on complex planning problems. Despite its strengths, our analysis shows that MCTD incurs substantial computational overhead due to the sequential nature of tree search and the cost of iterative denoising. To address this, we propose Fast-MCTD, a more efficient variant that preserves the strengths of MCTD while significantly improving its speed and scalability. Fast-MCTD integrates two techniques: Parallel MCTD, which enables parallel rollouts via delayed tree updates and redundancy-aware selection; and Sparse MCTD, which reduces rollout length through trajectory coarsening. Experiments show that Fast-MCTD achieves up to 100x speedup over standard MCTD while maintaining or improving planning performance. Remarkably, it even outperforms Diffuser in inference speed on some tasks, despite Diffuser requiring no search and yielding weaker solutions. These results position Fast-MCTD as a practical and scalable solution for diffusion-based inference-time reasoning.

Summary: <br />
Diplomacy, a complex multiplayer game, presents challenges for AI systems due to the need for both cooperation and competition. Traditional methods require extensive game data for training, while Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a more efficient approach through pre-training and fine-tuning. The proposed DipLLM agent utilizes an autoregressive factorization framework to simplify multi-unit action assignments. By defining an equilibrium policy as the learning objective, DipLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art Cicero model with just 1.5% of the required data.

Abstract: Diplomacy is a complex multiplayer game that requires both cooperation and competition, posing significant challenges for AI systems. Traditional methods rely on equilibrium search to generate extensive game data for training, which demands substantial computational resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, leveraging pre-trained knowledge to achieve strong performance with relatively small-scale fine-tuning. However, applying LLMs to Diplomacy remains challenging due to the exponential growth of possible action combinations and the intricate strategic interactions among players. To address this challenge, we propose DipLLM, a fine-tuned LLM-based agent that learns equilibrium policies for Diplomacy. DipLLM employs an autoregressive factorization framework to simplify the complex task of multi-unit action assignment into a sequence of unit-level decisions. By defining an equilibrium policy within this framework as the learning objective, we fine-tune the model using only 1.5% of the data required by the state-of-the-art Cicero model, surpassing its performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of fine-tuned LLMs for tackling complex strategic decision-making in multiplayer games.

Abstract: The ongoing evolution of AI paradigms has propelled AI research into the Agentic AI stage. Consequently, the focus of research has shifted from single agents and simple applications towards multi-agent autonomous decision-making and task collaboration in complex environments. As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance, their applications become more diverse and complex, leading to increasingly situational and systemic risks. This has brought significant attention to value alignment for AI agents, which aims to ensure that an agent's goals, preferences, and behaviors align with human values and societal norms. This paper reviews value alignment in agent systems within specific application scenarios. It integrates the advancements in AI driven by large models with the demands of social governance. Our review covers value principles, agent system application scenarios, and agent value alignment evaluation. Specifically, value principles are organized hierarchically from a top-down perspective, encompassing macro, meso, and micro levels. Agent system application scenarios are categorized and reviewed from a general-to-specific viewpoint. Agent value alignment evaluation systematically examines datasets for value alignment assessment and relevant value alignment methods. Additionally, we delve into value coordination among multiple agents within agent systems. Finally, we propose several potential research directions in this field.

<div> Modeling, Large Language Models, Intent Factored Generation, Diversity, Generation

Summary:
Intent Factor Generation (IFG) addresses the challenge of obtaining diverse, high-quality samples from Large Language Models. IFG involves sampling a semantically dense intent first, such as a summary or keywords, followed by generating the final response based on both the original prompt and the intent. Using a higher temperature during the intent sampling promotes conceptual diversity, while a lower temperature during final generation ensures coherence. Explicitly stating intent before generating each step improves reasoning tasks. IFG enhances performance on math, code, and instruction-tuning tasks, and maintains diversity and quality in general language modeling. By adjusting prompts and generation temperatures, IFG can be easily integrated into various algorithms for improved results across applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.09659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent, e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward. Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into many algorithms for gains across various applications.

<br />
Summary: 
This paper explores how humans revise their beliefs when presented with new information, crucial for developing AI systems that align with human reasoning. While theoretical frameworks exist, empirical evidence suggests people may follow different patterns. Three user studies reveal a consistent preference for explanation-based revisions guided by explanations, leading to belief changes not captured by classical theory. Participants showed a preference for non-minimal revisions, regardless of scenario type. These findings have implications for AI systems aiming to model human reasoning, suggesting they should include explanation-based belief revision operators to better align with human cognitive processes. <div>

Abstract: Understanding how humans revise their beliefs in light of new information is crucial for developing AI systems which can effectively model, and thus align with, human reasoning. While theoretical belief revision frameworks rely on a set of principles that establish how these operations are performed, empirical evidence from cognitive psychology suggests that people may follow different patterns when presented with conflicting information. In this paper, we present three comprehensive user studies showing that people consistently prefer explanation-based revisions, i.e., those which are guided by explanations, that result in changes to their belief systems that are not necessarily captured by classical belief change theory. Our experiments systematically investigate how people revise their beliefs with explanations for inconsistencies, whether they are provided with them or left to formulate them themselves, demonstrating a robust preference for what may seem non-minimal revisions across different types of scenarios. These findings have implications for AI systems designed to model human reasoning or interact with humans, suggesting that such systems should accommodate explanation-based, potentially non-minimal belief revision operators to better align with human cognitive processes.

Summary: <br />
This paper presents a novel self-supervised approach that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of robot interaction data to develop models capable of understanding, predicting, and planning in the physical world. The proposed V-JEPA 2 architecture achieves strong performance on motion understanding and human action anticipation tasks, surpassing previous models. By aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, state-of-the-art performance is demonstrated on video question-answering tasks. Additionally, self-supervised learning is applied to robotic planning tasks, resulting in the successful deployment of a latent action-conditioned world model, V-JEPA 2-AC, for picking and placing objects using planning with image goals on Franka arms in different lab environments. This achievement is remarkable as it is accomplished without collecting data from the robots in those environments or any task-specific training or reward. This work showcases the potential of self-supervised learning from web-scale data to create a world model capable of planning in the physical world. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A major challenge for modern AI is to learn to understand the world and learn to act largely by observation. This paper explores a self-supervised approach that combines internet-scale video data with a small amount of interaction data (robot trajectories), to develop models capable of understanding, predicting, and planning in the physical world. We first pre-train an action-free joint-embedding-predictive architecture, V-JEPA 2, on a video and image dataset comprising over 1 million hours of internet video. V-JEPA 2 achieves strong performance on motion understanding (77.3 top-1 accuracy on Something-Something v2) and state-of-the-art performance on human action anticipation (39.7 recall-at-5 on Epic-Kitchens-100) surpassing previous task-specific models. Additionally, after aligning V-JEPA 2 with a large language model, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on multiple video question-answering tasks at the 8 billion parameter scale (e.g., 84.0 on PerceptionTest, 76.9 on TempCompass). Finally, we show how self-supervised learning can be applied to robotic planning tasks by post-training a latent action-conditioned world model, V-JEPA 2-AC, using less than 62 hours of unlabeled robot videos from the Droid dataset. We deploy V-JEPA 2-AC zero-shot on Franka arms in two different labs and enable picking and placing of objects using planning with image goals. Notably, this is achieved without collecting any data from the robots in these environments, and without any task-specific training or reward. This work demonstrates how self-supervised learning from web-scale data and a small amount of robot interaction data can yield a world model capable of planning in the physical world.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces a unified threat model for evaluating jailbreaking attacks on safety-tuned language models (LLMs). By building an N-gram language model on a large text corpus, the authors propose a nonparametric and interpretable method to assess the likelihood of a jailbreak occurring in the text distribution. The comparison of popular attacks under this model reveals that attack success rates against modern models are lower than previously reported. Furthermore, attacks based on discrete optimization outperform recent LLM-based approaches. Effective attacks are found to exploit infrequent bigrams, either selecting absent or rare combinations specific to certain datasets like Reddit or code repositories. The interpretable nature of the threat model facilitates a comprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: A plethora of jailbreaking attacks have been proposed to obtain harmful responses from safety-tuned LLMs. These methods largely succeed in coercing the target output in their original settings, but their attacks vary substantially in fluency and computational effort. In this work, we propose a unified threat model for the principled comparison of these methods. Our threat model checks if a given jailbreak is likely to occur in the distribution of text. For this, we build an N-gram language model on 1T tokens, which, unlike model-based perplexity, allows for an LLM-agnostic, nonparametric, and inherently interpretable evaluation. We adapt popular attacks to this threat model, and, for the first time, benchmark these attacks on equal footing with it. After an extensive comparison, we find attack success rates against safety-tuned modern models to be lower than previously presented and that attacks based on discrete optimization significantly outperform recent LLM-based attacks. Being inherently interpretable, our threat model allows for a comprehensive analysis and comparison of jailbreak attacks. We find that effective attacks exploit and abuse infrequent bigrams, either selecting the ones absent from real-world text or rare ones, e.g., specific to Reddit or code datasets.

Summary: 
Reinforced Rule-based Reasoning, also known as RuleReasoner, introduces a method for effective rule-based reasoning using small reasoning models through domain-aware dynamic sampling. By resampling training batches based on historical rewards, RuleReasoner improves generalization across tasks and domains without the need for pre-hoc mix-training recipes. Empirical evaluations show that RuleReasoner outperforms large reasoning models on in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, displaying a significant performance advantage and higher computational efficiency. This approach highlights the effectiveness of small reasoning models in rule-based reasoning tasks and the importance of domain-aware sampling for reinforcement learning algorithms. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rule-based reasoning has been acknowledged as one of the fundamental problems in reasoning, while deviations in rule formats, types, and complexity in real-world applications pose severe challenges. Recent studies have shown that large reasoning models (LRMs) have remarkable reasoning capabilities, and their performance is substantially enhanced by reinforcement learning (RL). However, it remains an open question whether small reasoning models (SRMs) can learn rule-based reasoning effectively with robust generalization across diverse tasks and domains. To address this, we introduce Reinforced Rule-based Reasoning, a.k.a. RuleReasoner, a simple yet effective method to conduct rule-based reasoning via a wide collection of curated tasks and a novel domain-aware dynamic sampling approach. Specifically, RuleReasoner resamples each training batch by updating the sampling weights of different domains based on historical rewards. This facilitates domain augmentation and flexible online learning schedules for RL, obviating the need for pre-hoc human-engineered mix-training recipes used in existing methods. Empirical evaluations on in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks reveal that RuleReasoner outperforms frontier LRMs by a significant margin ($\Delta$4.1% average points on eight ID tasks and $\Delta$10.4% average points on three OOD tasks over OpenAI-o1). Notably, our approach also exhibits higher computational efficiency compared to prior dynamic sampling methods for RL.

Abstract: Antibody-facilitated immune responses are central to the body's defense against pathogens, viruses, and other foreign invaders. The ability of antibodies to specifically bind and neutralize antigens is vital for maintaining immunity. Over the past few decades, bioengineering advancements have significantly accelerated therapeutic antibody development. These antibody-derived drugs have shown remarkable efficacy, particularly in treating cancer, SARS-CoV-2, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases. Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of artificial intelligence, in silico medicine has been revolutionized; recent developments in machine learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based design and improved affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3 backbone and antibody sequence data sourced from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database. The proposed approach shows significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy) across multiple evaluation metrics. Specifically, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9640, an F1-score of 0.9643, a precision of 0.9702, a recall of 0.9586, and an AUC-ROC of 0.9936. Moreover, this strategy unveiled higher computational efficiency, with a five-fold average cumulative training time of only 0.46 hours, significantly lower than in previous studies.

Abstract: This paper introduces EdgeProfiler, a fast profiling framework designed for evaluating lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge systems. While LLMs offer remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, their high computational, memory, and power requirements often confine them to cloud environments. EdgeProfiler addresses these challenges by providing a systematic methodology for assessing LLM performance in resource-constrained edge settings. The framework profiles compact LLMs, including TinyLLaMA, Gemma3.1B, Llama3.2-1B, and DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, using aggressive quantization techniques and strict memory constraints. Analytical modeling is used to estimate latency, FLOPs, and energy consumption. The profiling reveals that 4-bit quantization reduces model memory usage by approximately 60-70%, while maintaining accuracy within 2-5% of full-precision baselines. Inference speeds are observed to improve by 2-3x compared to FP16 baselines across various edge devices. Power modeling estimates a 35-50% reduction in energy consumption for INT4 configurations, enabling practical deployment on hardware such as Raspberry Pi 4/5 and Jetson Orin Nano Super. Our findings emphasize the importance of efficient profiling tailored to lightweight LLMs in edge environments, balancing accuracy, energy efficiency, and computational feasibility.

Summary:
ReStNet is a novel approach for deploying pre-trained models in IoT applications with varying resource constraints. It dynamically constructs a hybrid network by stitching two models together based on layer-wise similarity. By retaining early layers from a larger model and appending deeper layers from a smaller model, ReStNet adapts to changing budgets efficiently. The stitching layer is fine-tuned for rapid deployment, enabling flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime. Supporting both homogeneous and heterogeneous stitching, ReStNet reduces training costs significantly while maintaining performance on multiple benchmarks. The proposed approach addresses key challenges such as optimal stitching points selection, stitching order determination, and fine-tuning strategy effectively, providing a reusable and stitchable solution for adapting deep learning models to diverse IoT devices. <br /> <div>

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep learning, a growing number of pre-trained models have been publicly available. However, deploying these fixed models in real-world IoT applications is challenging because different devices possess heterogeneous computational and memory resources, making it impossible to deploy a single model across all platforms. Although traditional compression methods, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation, can improve efficiency, they become inflexible once applied and cannot adapt to changing resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose ReStNet, a Reusable and Stitchable Network that dynamically constructs a hybrid network by stitching two pre-trained models together. Implementing ReStNet requires addressing several key challenges, including how to select the optimal stitching points, determine the stitching order of the two pre-trained models, and choose an effective fine-tuning strategy. To systematically address these challenges and adapt to varying resource constraints, ReStNet determines the stitching point by calculating layer-wise similarity via Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). It then constructs the hybrid model by retaining early layers from a larger-capacity model and appending deeper layers from a smaller one. To facilitate efficient deployment, only the stitching layer is fine-tuned. This design enables rapid adaptation to changing budgets while fully leveraging available resources. Moreover, ReStNet supports both homogeneous (CNN-CNN, Transformer-Transformer) and heterogeneous (CNN-Transformer) stitching, allowing to combine different model families flexibly. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ReStNet achieve flexible accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime while significantly reducing training cost.

<div> Keywords: Generative medical vision-language models, Security vulnerabilities, Inference-time defense, Visual and textual jailbreak attacks, Mixed demonstration strategy

Summary:
Generative medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) are designed to generate complex diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. However, the security vulnerabilities of these models are underexplored, leaving them susceptible to harmful queries. To address this, a novel inference-time defense strategy is proposed to mitigate such queries, including visual and textual jailbreak attacks. The strategy is based on synthetic clinical demonstrations and has been shown to improve model safety without significantly impacting performance. Increasing the demonstration budget can help alleviate over-defense issues. A mixed demonstration strategy is introduced as a trade-off solution for balancing security and performance when facing few-shot demonstration constraints. This research highlights the importance of ensuring the security of Med-VLMs while maintaining their overall functionality and performance levels. 

<br /><br />Summary: Generative medical vision-language models are vulnerable to harmful queries, but a novel defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations can enhance model safety without compromising performance. Increasing the demonstration budget and adopting a mixed demonstration strategy offer solutions to balance security and performance in the face of security threats. <div>

Abstract: Generative medical vision-language models~(Med-VLMs) are primarily designed to generate complex textual information~(e.g., diagnostic reports) from multimodal inputs including vision modality~(e.g., medical images) and language modality~(e.g., clinical queries). However, their security vulnerabilities remain underexplored. Med-VLMs should be capable of rejecting harmful queries, such as \textit{Provide detailed instructions for using this CT scan for insurance fraud}. At the same time, addressing security concerns introduces the risk of over-defense, where safety-enhancing mechanisms may degrade general performance, causing Med-VLMs to reject benign clinical queries. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time defense strategy to mitigate harmful queries, enabling defense against visual and textual jailbreak attacks. Using diverse medical imaging datasets collected from nine modalities, we demonstrate that our defense strategy based on synthetic clinical demonstrations enhances model safety without significantly compromising performance. Additionally, we find that increasing the demonstration budget alleviates the over-defense issue. We then introduce a mixed demonstration strategy as a trade-off solution for balancing security and performance under few-shot demonstration budget constraints.

Summary: <br />3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is widely used for its sparse Gaussian-based representation but struggles to meet the real-time requirement of 90 FPS on mobile devices. Existing accelerators focus on compute efficiency, overlooking memory efficiency and leading to high DRAM traffic.

This transformation from tile-centric to memory-centric rendering resulted in significant speedup and energy savings over mobile Ampere GPUs, with up to 45.7 times faster performance and 62.9 times less energy consumption. By optimizing both compute and memory efficiency, STREAMINGGS demonstrates a more effective solution for real-time 3D rendering on resource-constrained mobile devices. <br /> <div>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its efficiency and sparse Gaussian-based representation. However, 3DGS struggles to meet the real-time requirement of 90 frames per second (FPS) on resource-constrained mobile devices, achieving only 2 to 9 FPS.Existing accelerators focus on compute efficiency but overlook memory efficiency, leading to redundant DRAM traffic. We introduce STREAMINGGS, a fully streaming 3DGS algorithm-architecture co-design that achieves fine-grained pipelining and reduces DRAM traffic by transforming from a tile-centric rendering to a memory-centric rendering. Results show that our design achieves up to 45.7 $\times$ speedup and 62.9 $\times$ energy savings over mobile Ampere GPUs.

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have successfully extended the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm to image-based reasoning, yet video-based reasoning remains an underdeveloped frontier, primarily due to the scarcity of high-quality reasoning-oriented data and effective training methodologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DarkEventInfer and MixVidQA, two novel datasets specifically designed to stimulate the model's advanced video understanding and reasoning abilities. DarkEventinfer presents videos with masked event segments, requiring models to infer the obscured content based on contextual video cues. MixVidQA, on the other hand, presents interleaved video sequences composed of two distinct clips, challenging models to isolate and reason about one while disregarding the other. Leveraging these carefully curated training samples together with reinforcement learning guided by diverse reward functions, we develop VersaVid-R1, the first versatile video understanding and reasoning model under the Reason-Then-Respond paradigm capable of handling multiple-choice and open-ended question answering, as well as video captioning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VersaVid-R1 significantly outperforms existing models across a broad spectrum of benchmarks, covering video general understanding, cognitive reasoning, and captioning tasks.

Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models, demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval, confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better risk-adjusted returns.

Summary:
The article introduces AVA-Bench, a benchmark that disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs) to accurately evaluate vision foundation models (VFMs). This approach addresses the limitations of current evaluation protocols by matching training and test distributions and pinpointing where VFMs excel or falter in specific visual abilities. By decoupling AVAs, AVA-Bench allows for a more transparent and comprehensive evaluation of VFMs, offering a principled approach to VFM selection. The study reveals that a 0.5B LLM can yield similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while significantly reducing GPU hours by 8x, making evaluations more efficient. Overall, AVA-Bench aims to pave the way for the next generation of VFMs by providing a systematic and thorough evaluation framework.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The rise of vision foundation models (VFMs) calls for systematic evaluation. A common approach pairs VFMs with large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose heads, followed by evaluation on broad Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. However, this protocol has two key blind spots: (i) the instruction tuning data may not align with VQA test distributions, meaning a wrong prediction can stem from such data mismatch rather than a VFM' visual shortcomings; (ii) VQA benchmarks often require multiple visual abilities, making it hard to tell whether errors stem from lacking all required abilities or just a single critical one. To address these gaps, we introduce AVA-Bench, the first benchmark that explicitly disentangles 14 Atomic Visual Abilities (AVAs) -- foundational skills like localization, depth estimation, and spatial understanding that collectively support complex visual reasoning tasks. By decoupling AVAs and matching training and test distributions within each, AVA-Bench pinpoints exactly where a VFM excels or falters. Applying AVA-Bench to leading VFMs thus reveals distinctive "ability fingerprints," turning VFM selection from educated guesswork into principled engineering. Notably, we find that a 0.5B LLM yields similar VFM rankings as a 7B LLM while cutting GPU hours by 8x, enabling more efficient evaluation. By offering a comprehensive and transparent benchmark, we hope AVA-Bench lays the foundation for the next generation of VFMs.

BakuFlow is a new semi-automatic label generation tool designed to streamline the data annotation process in computer vision tasks. It offers features such as a live adjustable magnifier for precise manual corrections, an interactive data augmentation module, label propagation for quick annotation of video data, and an automatic labeling module based on a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike traditional tools, BakuFlow allows users to easily add new object classes and multiple visual prompts per class during annotation, making it highly flexible and scalable for dynamic datasets. It is particularly effective for object detection and tracking, reducing the labeling workload significantly and enhancing efficiency in real-world applications of computer vision, such as industrial scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.09083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately labeling (or annotation) data is still a bottleneck in computer vision, especially for large-scale tasks where manual labeling is time-consuming and error-prone. While tools like LabelImg can handle the labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic, real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.

The article discusses the importance of optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results for enhancing user experience. It focuses on fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for Whole Page Optimization (WPO) using user feedback as supervision. The proposed approach, PageLLM, utilizes a mixed-grained reward mechanism, combining page-level and item-level rewards.

This approach addresses the challenges of fine-tuning LLMs for WPO, especially in large-scale systems interacting with numerous items daily, by utilizing noisy but valuable user feedback to optimize both the holistic presentation and individual components effectively. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Optimizing the presentation of search and recommendation results is crucial to enhancing user experience and engagement. Whole Page Optimization (WPO) plays a pivotal role in this process, as it directly influences how information is surfaced to users. While Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant content, fine-tuning these models for complex tasks like WPO presents challenges. Specifically, the need for extensive human-annotated data to mitigate issues such as hallucinations and model instability can be prohibitively expensive, especially in large-scale systems that interact with millions of items daily. In this work, we address the challenge of fine-tuning LLMs for WPO by using user feedback as the supervision. Unlike manually labeled datasets, user feedback is inherently noisy and less precise. To overcome this, we propose a reward-based fine-tuning approach, PageLLM, which employs a mixed-grained reward mechanism that combines page-level and item-level rewards. The page-level reward evaluates the overall quality and coherence, while the item-level reward focuses on the accuracy and relevance of key recommendations. This dual-reward structure ensures that both the holistic presentation and the critical individual components are optimized. We validate PageLLM on both public and industrial datasets. PageLLM outperforms baselines and achieves a 0.44\% GMV increase in an online A/B test with over 10 million users, demonstrating its real-world impact.

Summary:
Feature transformation is crucial in enhancing data representation, but existing methods face challenges in stable and valid generation. A new teaming framework is proposed to combine the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) for valid syntax and Machine Learning (ML) for stable performance. The framework includes steps such as generating high-quality examples, embedding feature transformation sequences, distilling knowledge from a teacher LLM, and combining LLM and ML probabilities for generation. Experimental results show a 5% improvement in downstream performance and a reduction in error cases by half. The teaming policy is efficient and robust, utilizing LLMs' capacity to understand original data effectively. <div>

Abstract: Feature transformation enhances data representation by deriving new features from the original data. Generative AI offers potential for this task, but faces challenges in stable generation (consistent outputs) and valid generation (error-free sequences). Existing methods--traditional MLs' low validity and LLMs' instability--fail to resolve both. We find that LLMs ensure valid syntax, while ML's gradient-steered search stabilizes performance. To bridge this gap, we propose a teaming framework combining LLMs' symbolic generation with ML's gradient optimization. This framework includes four steps: (1) golden examples generation, aiming to prepare high-quality samples with the ground knowledge of the teacher LLM; (2) feature transformation sequence embedding and search, intending to uncover potentially superior embeddings within the latent space; (3) student LLM feature transformation, aiming to distill knowledge from the teacher LLM; (4) LLM-ML decoder teaming, dedicating to combine ML and the student LLM probabilities for valid and stable generation. The experiments on various datasets show that the teaming policy can achieve 5\% improvement in downstream performance while reducing nearly half of the error cases. The results also demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the teaming policy. Additionally, we also have exciting findings on LLMs' capacity to understand the original data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in general-purpose code generation. However, generating the code which is deeply hardware-specific, architecture-aware, and performance-critical, especially for massively parallel GPUs, remains a complex challenge. In this work, we explore the use of LLMs for the automated generation and optimization of CUDA programs, with the goal of producing high-performance GPU kernels that fully exploit the underlying hardware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{Feature Search and Reinforcement (FSR)}. FSR jointly optimizes compilation and functional correctness, as well as the runtime performance, which are validated through extensive and diverse test cases, and measured by actual kernel execution latency on the target GPU, respectively. This approach enables LLMs not only to generate syntactically and semantically correct CUDA code but also to iteratively refine it for efficiency, tailored to the characteristics of the GPU architecture. We evaluate FSR on representative CUDA kernels, covering AI workloads and computational intensive algorithms. Our results show that LLMs augmented with FSR consistently guarantee correctness rates. Meanwhile, the automatically generated kernels can outperform general human-written code by a factor of up to 179$\times$ in execution speeds. These findings highlight the potential of combining LLMs with performance reinforcement to automate GPU programming for hardware-specific, architecture-sensitive, and performance-critical applications.

Summary: <br />
Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to improve overall performance by training a model on diverse task datasets. Current approaches focus on merging model parameters but often neglect out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. The proposed LwPTV method introduces a saliency score to measure parameter redundancy in task vectors, enabling layer-wise pruning. This method enhances OOD performance while maintaining effectiveness on in-domain (ID) tasks. By integrating with existing model merging methods, LwPTV offers flexibility and significant improvements in OOD task performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach, showcasing its ability to enhance performance across a range of tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) concurrently trains a model on diverse task datasets to exploit common features, thereby improving overall performance across the tasks. Recent studies have dedicated efforts to merging multiple independent model parameters into a unified model for MTL, thus circumventing the need for training data and expanding the scope of applicable scenarios of MTL. However, current approaches to model merging predominantly concentrate on enhancing performance within in-domain (ID) datasets, often overlooking their efficacy on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets. In this work, we proposed LwPTV (Layer-wise Pruning Task Vector) by building a saliency score, measuring the redundancy of parameters in task vectors. Designed in this way ours can achieve mask vector for each task and thus perform layer-wise pruning on the task vectors, only keeping the pre-trained model parameters at the corresponding layer in merged model. Owing to its flexibility, our method can be seamlessly integrated with most of existing model merging methods to improve their performance on OOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the application of our method results in substantial enhancements in OOD performance while preserving the ability on ID tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are changing the way medical images are analyzed by learning from large collections of unlabeled data. Instead of relying on manually annotated examples, FMs are pre-trained to learn general-purpose visual features that can later be adapted to specific clinical tasks with little additional supervision. In this review, we examine how FMs are being developed and applied in pathology, radiology, and ophthalmology, drawing on evidence from over 150 studies. We explain the core components of FM pipelines, including model architectures, self-supervised learning methods, and strategies for downstream adaptation. We also review how FMs are being used in each imaging domain and compare design choices across applications. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open questions to guide future research.

<br />
Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to improving reward modeling for large language models. By leveraging generation probabilities, the proposed method establishes reward consistency within response trajectories, allowing for finer-grained signals in reward learning. Through an intra-trajectory consistency regularization, the model ensures that adjacent processes with higher generation probabilities maintain consistent rewards. Applying this regularization improves the performance of outcome reward models on RewardBench and leads to better DPO-aligned policies and best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results. The code for the proposed method is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Reward models are critical for improving large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or inference-time verification. Current reward modeling typically relies on scores of overall responses to learn the outcome rewards for the responses. However, since the response-level scores are coarse-grained supervision signals, the reward model struggles to identify the specific components within a response trajectory that truly correlate with the scores, leading to poor generalization on unseen responses. In this paper, we propose to leverage generation probabilities to establish reward consistency between processes in the response trajectory, which allows the response-level supervisory signal to propagate across processes, thereby providing additional fine-grained signals for reward learning. Building on analysis under the Bayesian framework, we develop an intra-trajectory consistency regularization to enforce that adjacent processes with higher next-token generation probability maintain more consistent rewards. We apply the proposed regularization to the advanced outcome reward model, improving its performance on RewardBench. Besides, we show that the reward model trained with the proposed regularization induces better DPO-aligned policies and achieves better best-of-N (BON) inference-time verification results.

<div> capacity-limited Transformer models, memorization, generalization, pre-training, learning behavior <br />
<br />Summary: 
The study explores the relationship between memorization and generalization in large language models (LLMs) through pre-training capacity-limited Transformer models on synthetic character-level tasks. It reveals a trade-off between small models that excel in extrapolation but struggle with memorization, and larger models that memorize well but fail in extrapolation. An intermediate-capacity model shows a shift towards memorization. When trained on both tasks simultaneously, no model successfully extrapolates. The findings suggest that pre-training may inherently favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these dynamics, the research sheds light on how model capacity influences learning behavior, with implications for the design and deployment of small language models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The relationship between memorization and generalization in large language models (LLMs) remains an open area of research, with growing evidence that the two are deeply intertwined. In this work, we investigate this relationship by pre-training a series of capacity-limited Transformer models from scratch on two synthetic character-level tasks designed to separately probe generalization (via arithmetic extrapolation) and memorization (via factual recall). We observe a consistent trade-off: small models extrapolate to unseen arithmetic cases but fail to memorize facts, while larger models memorize but fail to extrapolate. An intermediate-capacity model exhibits a similar shift toward memorization. When trained on both tasks jointly, no model (regardless of size) succeeds at extrapolation. These findings suggest that pre-training may intrinsically favor one learning mode over the other. By isolating these dynamics in a controlled setting, our study offers insight into how model capacity shapes learning behavior and offers broader implications for the design and deployment of small language models.

Abstract: Feature shifts between data sources are present in many applications involving healthcare, biomedical, socioeconomic, financial, survey, and multi-sensor data, among others, where unharmonized heterogeneous data sources, noisy data measurements, or inconsistent processing and standardization pipelines can lead to erroneous features. Localizing shifted features is important to address the underlying cause of the shift and correct or filter the data to avoid degrading downstream analysis. While many techniques can detect distribution shifts, localizing the features originating them is still challenging, with current solutions being either inaccurate or not scalable to large and high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we introduce the Feature Shift Localization Network (FSL-Net), a neural network that can localize feature shifts in large and high-dimensional datasets in a fast and accurate manner. The network, trained with a large number of datasets, learns to extract the statistical properties of the datasets and can localize feature shifts from previously unseen datasets and shifts without the need for re-training. The code and ready-to-use trained model are available at https://github.com/AI-sandbox/FSL-Net.

Summary:<br />
- The study addresses the challenge of deploying large language models (LLMs) on resource-constrained devices by proposing a novel quantization framework, Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ).<br />
- UPQ utilizes block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) and distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) to quantize instruction-tuned LLMs to 2-bit precision.<br />
- The framework first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to minimize quantization error.<br />
- Distill-QAT is then applied to ensure INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs produce responses consistent with their original FP16 counterparts.<br />
- UPQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs, such as MMLU and IFEval, without relying on proprietary post-training data. 

Summary: <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.09104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the rapid scaling of large language models (LLMs) poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices, there is growing interest in extremely low-bit quantization, such as 2-bit. Although prior works have shown that 2-bit large models are pareto-optimal over their 4-bit smaller counterparts in both accuracy and latency, these advancements have been limited to pre-trained LLMs and have not yet been extended to instruction-tuned models. To bridge this gap, we propose Unified Progressive Quantization (UPQ)$-$a novel progressive quantization framework (FP16$\rightarrow$INT4$\rightarrow$INT2) that unifies block-wise post-training quantization (PTQ) with distillation-based quantization-aware training (Distill-QAT) for INT2 instruction-tuned LLM quantization. UPQ first quantizes FP16 instruction-tuned models to INT4 using block-wise PTQ to significantly reduce the quantization error introduced by subsequent INT2 quantization. Next, UPQ applies Distill-QAT to enable INT2 instruction-tuned LLMs to generate responses consistent with their original FP16 counterparts by minimizing the generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between the two. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that UPQ can quantize open-source instruction-tuned LLMs to INT2 without relying on proprietary post-training data, while achieving state-of-the-art performances on MMLU and IFEval$-$two of the most representative benchmarks for evaluating instruction-tuned LLMs.

<br />
Summary: 
MetaTT is introduced as a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for efficient global low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike existing methods like LoRA, MetaTT utilizes a shared TT to factorize all transformer sub-modules, leading to a significantly compressed final adapter with fewer parameters. The framework allows for easy extension to various tasks without having to redesign the core tensor. MetaTT outperforms other tensor-based methods in reducing parameters while maintaining accuracy comparable to LoRA. The TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines, simplifying training processes. Overall, MetaTT offers a promising approach for enhancing the efficiency and performance of fine-tuning pre-trained transformers. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We present MetaTT, a unified Tensor Train (TT) adapter framework for global low-rank fine-tuning of pre-trained transformers. Unlike LoRA, which fine-tunes each weight matrix independently, MetaTT uses a single shared TT to factorize all transformer sub-modules -- query, key, value, projection, and feed-forward layers -- by indexing the structural axes like layer and matrix type, and optionally heads and tasks. For a given rank, while LoRA adds parameters proportional to the product across modes, MetaTT only adds parameters proportional to the sum across modes leading to a significantly compressed final adapter. Our benchmarks compare MetaTT with LoRA along with recent state-of-the-art matrix and tensor decomposition based fine-tuning schemes. We observe that when tested on standard language modeling benchmarks, MetaTT leads to the most reduction in the parameters while maintaining similar accuracy to LoRA and even outperforming other tensor-based methods. Unlike CP or other rank-factorizations, the TT ansatz benefits from mature optimization routines -- e.g., DMRG-style rank adaptive minimization in addition to Adam, which we find simplifies training. Because new modes can be appended cheaply, MetaTT naturally extends to shared adapters across many tasks without redesigning the core tensor.

Summary: 
The article discusses the need for AI fairness and the harmful incidents caused by computational biases. It proposes the use of agents technology as fairness guardians in the AI pipeline, focusing on data preprocessing, model building, and deployment stages. The FAIRTOPIA framework is introduced, utilizing a three-layered architecture to embed multi-role agents and ensure fairness throughout the decision-making process. The framework involves ongoing fairness watch schemes and encourages interdisciplinary research grounded in human-centric principles. By enacting fairness watch at all stages of the AI pipeline, the authors aim to create adaptive and realistic AI fairness frameworks that can be customized for different scenarios. The approach emphasizes a systematic and interdisciplinary approach, promoting collaboration between humans and AI systems to prioritize fairness in decision-making processes.

Abstract: AI models have become active decision makers, often acting without human supervision. The rapid advancement of AI technology has already caused harmful incidents that have hurt individuals and societies and AI unfairness in heavily criticized. It is urgent to disrupt AI pipelines which largely neglect human principles and focus on computational biases exploration at the data (pre), model(in), and deployment (post) processing stages. We claim that by exploiting the advances of agents technology, we will introduce cautious, prompt, and ongoing fairness watch schemes, under realistic, systematic, and human-centric fairness expectations. We envision agents as fairness guardians, since agents learn from their environment, adapt to new information, and solve complex problems by interacting with external tools and other systems. To set the proper fairness guardrails in the overall AI pipeline, we introduce a fairness-by-design approach which embeds multi-role agents in an end-to-end (human to AI) synergetic scheme. Our position is that we may design adaptive and realistic AI fairness frameworks, and we introduce a generalized algorithm which can be customized to the requirements and goals of each AI decision making scenario. Our proposed, so called FAIRTOPIA framework, is structured over a three-layered architecture, which encapsulates the AI pipeline inside an agentic guardian and a knowledge-based, self-refining layered scheme. Based on our proposition, we enact fairness watch in all of the AI pipeline stages, under robust multi-agent workflows, which will inspire new fairness research hypothesis, heuristics, and methods grounded in human-centric, systematic, interdisciplinary, socio-technical principles.

Abstract: We present SensorLM, a family of sensor-language foundation models that enable wearable sensor data understanding with natural language. Despite its pervasive nature, aligning and interpreting sensor data with language remains challenging due to the lack of paired, richly annotated sensor-text descriptions in uncurated, real-world wearable data. We introduce a hierarchical caption generation pipeline designed to capture statistical, structural, and semantic information from sensor data. This approach enabled the curation of the largest sensor-language dataset to date, comprising over 59.7 million hours of data from more than 103,000 people. Furthermore, SensorLM extends prominent multimodal pretraining architectures (e.g., CLIP, CoCa) and recovers them as specific variants within a generic architecture. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks in human activity analysis and healthcare verify the superior performance of SensorLM over state-of-the-art in zero-shot recognition, few-shot learning, and cross-modal retrieval. SensorLM also demonstrates intriguing capabilities including scaling behaviors, label efficiency, sensor captioning, and zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks.

Abstract: Prompting large language models (LLMs) to evaluate generated text, known as LLM-as-a-judge, has become a standard evaluation approach in natural language generation (NLG), but is primarily used as a quantitative tool, i.e. with numerical scores as main outputs. In this work, we propose LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge, an LLM-based evaluation approach with the main output being a structured report of common issue types in the NLG system outputs. Our approach is targeted at providing developers with meaningful insights on what improvements can be done to a given NLG system and consists of two main steps, namely open-ended per-instance issue analysis and clustering of the discovered issues using an intuitive cumulative algorithm. We also introduce a strategy for evaluating the proposed approach, coupled with ~300 annotations of issues in instances from 12 NLG datasets. Our results show that LLM-as-a-qualitative-judge correctly recognizes instance-specific issues in 2/3 cases and is capable of producing error type reports resembling the reports composed by human annotators.

Summary:<br /><br />AI chatbots are increasingly being used in education, raising questions about the types of trust students develop towards these systems. The study examines the influence of human-like and system-like trust on students' perceptions of AI chatbots. Results show that both types of trust significantly affect student perceptions, with human-like trust more strongly predicting trusting intention and system-like trust better predicting behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. This suggests that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots, termed human-AI trust. The findings emphasize the need for new theoretical frameworks specific to human-AI trust in educational settings to foster appropriate trust levels critical for effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI technologies. <div>
arXiv:2506.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity regarding whether students develop trust toward them as they would a human peer or instructor, based in interpersonal trust, or as they would any other piece of technology, based in technology trust. This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social technologies, leaving their applicability to anthropomorphic systems unclear. To address this gap, we investigate how human-like and system-like trusting beliefs comparatively influence students' perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness of an AI chatbot - factors associated with students' engagement and learning outcomes. Through partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that human-like and system-like trust significantly influenced student perceptions, with varied effects. Human-like trust more strongly predicted trusting intention, while system-like trust better predicted behavioral intention and perceived usefulness. Both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. Given the partial explanatory power of each type of trust, we propose that students develop a distinct form of trust with AI chatbots (human-AI trust) that differs from human-human and human-technology models of trust. Our findings highlight the need for new theoretical frameworks specific to human-AI trust and offer practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.

Summary: 
This study investigates the relationship between physical activity (PA) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. VAT is a marker of metabolic health, and excess VAT is linked to type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The study utilized two approaches to estimate VAT from activity data: one using engineered features and ridge regression, and the other using deep neural networks. The most accurate estimates were achieved by combining the two approaches with the addition of subject demographics and body measurements as covariates, resulting in VAT estimates with a strong correlation of r=0.86. These findings highlight the strong link between PA and VAT, emphasizing the importance of physical activity in reducing metabolic health risks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is a key marker of both metabolic health and habitual physical activity (PA). Excess VAT is highly correlated with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. The mechanistic basis for this pathophysiology relates to overloading the liver with fatty acids. VAT is also a highly labile fat depot, with increased turnover stimulated by catecholamines during exercise. VAT can be measured with sophisticated imaging technologies, but can also be inferred directly from PA. We tested this relationship using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2014, for individuals aged 20-60 years with 7 days of accelerometry data (n=2,456 men; 2,427 women) [1]. Two approaches were used for estimating VAT from activity. The first used engineered features based on movements during gait and sleep, and then ridge regression to map summary statistics of these features into a VAT estimate. The second approach used deep neural networks trained on 24 hours of continuous accelerometry. A foundation model first mapped each 10s frame into a high-dimensional feature vector. A transformer model then mapped each day's feature vector time series into a VAT estimate, which were averaged over multiple days. For both approaches, the most accurate estimates were obtained with the addition of covariate information about subject demographics and body measurements. The best performance was obtained by combining the two approaches, resulting in VAT estimates with correlations of r=0.86. These findings demonstrate a strong relationship between PA and VAT and, by extension, between PA and metabolic health risks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, planning, atomic facts, lookahead search, interactive tasks

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces a novel framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning. This is achieved by extracting task-critical "atomic facts" from interaction trajectories and using them to augment prompts provided to LLM components responsible for action proposal, world model simulation, and state-value estimation. Planning is facilitated through a depth-limited lookahead search, where the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates outcomes based on accumulated facts and interaction history. The approach allows the agent to improve its decision-making online without weight updates, leveraging experience for better performance and adaptability on interactive tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld. Theoretical motivation is provided linking performance to fact-based abstraction quality and LLM simulation accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable but often require significant guidance or extensive interaction history to perform effectively in complex, interactive environments. Existing methods may struggle with adapting to new information or efficiently utilizing past experiences for multi-step reasoning without fine-tuning. We introduce a novel LLM agent framework that enhances planning capabilities through in-context learning, facilitated by atomic fact augmentation and a recursive lookahead search. Our agent learns to extract task-critical ``atomic facts'' from its interaction trajectories. These facts dynamically augment the prompts provided to LLM-based components responsible for action proposal, latent world model simulation, and state-value estimation. Planning is performed via a depth-limited lookahead search, where the LLM simulates potential trajectories and evaluates their outcomes, guided by the accumulated facts and interaction history. This approach allows the agent to improve its understanding and decision-making online, leveraging its experience to refine its behavior without weight updates. We provide a theoretical motivation linking performance to the quality of fact-based abstraction and LLM simulation accuracy. Empirically, our agent demonstrates improved performance and adaptability on challenging interactive tasks, achieving more optimal behavior as it accumulates experience, showcased in tasks such as TextFrozenLake and ALFWorld.

<div> Keywords: Phrases, speech translation, phrase dictionary biasing, transducer-based model, multimodal language model

Summary: 
Phrases play a crucial role in understanding conversations, but their accurate translation poses a challenge due to their infrequent occurrence in training data. To address this issue, a phrase dictionary biasing method is proposed in this paper to utilize pairs of phrases mapping from source language to target language. The method is applied to two popular models: a transducer-based streaming speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental results demonstrate that the phrase dictionary biasing method surpasses phrase list biasing by 21% in the streaming speech translation model. Moreover, the method enables multimodal large language models to benefit from external phrase information, achieving an 85% relative improvement in phrase recall. <div>

Abstract: Phrases are essential to understand the core concepts in conversations. However, due to their rare occurrence in training data, correct translation of phrases is challenging in speech translation tasks. In this paper, we propose a phrase dictionary biasing method to leverage pairs of phrases mapping from the source language to the target language. We apply the phrase dictionary biasing method to two types of widely adopted models, a transducer-based streaming speech translation model and a multimodal large language model. Experimental results show that the phrase dictionary biasing method outperforms phrase list biasing by 21% relatively for the streaming speech translation model. In addition, phrase dictionary biasing enables multimodal large language models to use external phrase information, achieving 85% relative improvement in phrase recall.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, human feedback, decision-making, multi-task learning, rating-based RL<br />
Summary: <br />
Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning model behavior with users' goals. Current RLHF approaches often oversimplify human decision-making by focusing on isolated tasks like classification or regression. This paper introduces a novel RL method that mimics human decision-making by considering multiple tasks simultaneously. By using human ratings in reward-free environments to infer a reward function, this method introduces learnable weights to balance the contributions of classification and regression models, thus capturing the uncertainty in human decision-making and allowing for adaptive prioritization of strategies. Experimental results show that this approach consistently outperforms existing rating-based RL methods and can even surpass traditional RL approaches in some scenarios. This novel method shows promise in enhancing the alignment between AI models and human users' goals. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feeback (RLHF) has become a key factor in aligning model behavior with users' goals. However, while humans integrate multiple strategies when making decisions, current RLHF approaches often simplify this process by modeling human reasoning through isolated tasks such as classification or regression. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) method that mimics human decision-making by jointly considering multiple tasks. Specifically, we leverage human ratings in reward-free environments to infer a reward function, introducing learnable weights that balance the contributions of both classification and regression models. This design captures the inherent uncertainty in human decision-making and allows the model to adaptively emphasize different strategies. We conduct several experiments using synthetic human ratings to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Results show that our method consistently outperforms existing rating-based RL methods, and in some cases, even surpasses traditional RL approaches.

Abstract: This study examines the integration of Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) with Spiking Neural Networks (SNN). While CPC learns the predictive structure of data to generate meaningful representations, SNN mimics the computational processes of biological neural systems over time. In this study, the goal is to develop a predictive coding model with greater biological plausibility by processing inputs and outputs in a spike-based system. The proposed model was tested on the MNIST dataset and achieved a high classification rate in distinguishing positive sequential samples from non-sequential negative samples.

Summary:
The research focuses on optimizing multi-UAV systems with dual objectives: maximizing service coverage and extending battery lifetime. The proposed Graph Attention-based Decentralized Actor-Critic (GADC) approach uses a graph attention network to process UAVs' limited local observation and reduce environment state dimensions. An actor-double-critic network is developed to manage dual policies for joint objective optimization. The GADC utilizes a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence factor to balance the tradeoff between coverage performance and battery lifetime.

Summary:
FLoRIST introduces a federated fine-tuning framework, incorporating low-rank adaptation for Large Language Models (LLMs) without sharing local data. It addresses challenges in federated learning by accurately aggregating local adapters without high communication or computational costs. The framework efficiently decomposes stacked local adapters through singular value decomposition, selecting an optimal rank for global low-rank adapters. Empirical evaluations show FLoRIST achieves a balance between communication efficiency and model performance in various setups, demonstrating its effectiveness for federated fine-tuning of LLMs.

Abstract: Integrating Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into federated learning offers a promising solution for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) without sharing local data. However, several methods designed for federated LoRA present significant challenges in balancing communication efficiency, model accuracy, and computational cost, particularly among heterogeneous clients. These methods either rely on simplistic averaging of local adapters, which introduces aggregation noise, require transmitting large stacked local adapters, leading to poor communication efficiency, or necessitate reconstructing memory-dense global weight-update matrix and performing computationally expensive decomposition to design client-specific low-rank adapters. In this work, we propose FLoRIST, a federated fine-tuning framework that achieves mathematically accurate aggregation without incurring high communication or computational overhead. Instead of constructing the full global weight-update matrix at the server, FLoRIST employs an efficient decomposition pipeline by performing singular value decomposition on stacked local adapters separately. This approach operates within a compact intermediate space to represent the accumulated information from local LoRAs. We introduce tunable singular value thresholding for server-side optimal rank selection to construct a pair of global low-rank adapters shared by all clients. Extensive empirical evaluations across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate that FLoRIST consistently strikes the best balance between superior communication efficiency and competitive performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous setups.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning datasets, with each cluster center representing the policy that generated the trajectories. It formulates a clustering objective based on the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions. The proposed methods, PG-Kmeans and CAAE, aim to cluster trajectories by training behavior cloning policies and guiding latent representations towards specific codebook entries, respectively. The finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans is theoretically proven, highlighting the challenge of optimal solutions ambiguity in offline trajectory clustering. Experimental validation on D4RL and GridWorld environments shows that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters, offering a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.

Abstract: We introduce a novel task of clustering trajectories from offline reinforcement learning (RL) datasets, where each cluster center represents the policy that generated its trajectories. By leveraging the connection between the KL-divergence of offline trajectory distributions and a mixture of policy-induced distributions, we formulate a natural clustering objective. To solve this, we propose Policy-Guided K-means (PG-Kmeans) and Centroid-Attracted Autoencoder (CAAE). PG-Kmeans iteratively trains behavior cloning (BC) policies and assigns trajectories based on policy generation probabilities, while CAAE resembles the VQ-VAE framework by guiding the latent representations of trajectories toward the vicinity of specific codebook entries to achieve clustering. Theoretically, we prove the finite-step convergence of PG-Kmeans and identify a key challenge in offline trajectory clustering: the inherent ambiguity of optimal solutions due to policy-induced conflicts, which can result in multiple equally valid but structurally distinct clusterings. Experimentally, we validate our methods on the widely used D4RL dataset and custom GridWorld environments. Our results show that both PG-Kmeans and CAAE effectively partition trajectories into meaningful clusters. They offer a promising framework for policy-based trajectory clustering, with broad applications in offline RL and beyond.

Summary: 
This study focuses on enhancing the performance of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to Multi-layer Perceptrons (SET-MLP) by utilizing structural optimization. As Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) become more complex, reducing computational costs and memory overhead is crucial. Sparsity has emerged as an effective approach to achieve this. The research demonstrates the effectiveness of sparse MLPs for supervised feature selection and the application of SET in reducing computational costs while maintaining accuracy. By incorporating motif-based optimization, the SET algorithm can be further improved, potentially achieving efficiency gains of over 40% with a performance decline of less than 4%. The study aims to investigate the impact of structural optimization on SET-MLP performance and assess the extent to which these enhancements can be achieved. <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have been proven to be exceptionally effective and have been applied across diverse domains within deep learning. However, as DNN models increase in complexity, the demand for reduced computational costs and memory overheads has become increasingly urgent. Sparsity has emerged as a leading approach in this area. The robustness of sparse Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for supervised feature selection, along with the application of Sparse Evolutionary Training (SET), illustrates the feasibility of reducing computational costs without compromising accuracy. Moreover, it is believed that the SET algorithm can still be improved through a structural optimization method called motif-based optimization, with potential efficiency gains exceeding 40% and a performance decline of under 4%. This research investigates whether the structural optimization of Sparse Evolutionary Training applied to Multi-layer Perceptrons (SET-MLP) can enhance performance and to what extent this improvement can be achieved.

Abstract: The scarcity of large-scale classroom speech data has hindered the development of AI-driven speech models for education. Public classroom datasets remain limited, and the lack of a dedicated classroom noise corpus prevents the use of standard data augmentation techniques.
  In this paper, we introduce a scalable methodology for synthesizing classroom noise using game engines, a framework that extends to other domains. Using this methodology, we present SimClass, a dataset that includes both a synthesized classroom noise corpus and a simulated classroom speech dataset. The speech data is generated by pairing a public children's speech corpus with YouTube lecture videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions. Our experiments on clean and noisy speech demonstrate that SimClass closely approximates real classroom speech, making it a valuable resource for developing robust speech recognition and enhancement models.

Abstract: We investigate the design of pooling methods used to summarize the outputs of transformer embedding models, primarily motivated by reinforcement learning and vision applications. This work considers problems where a subset of the input vectors contains requisite information for a downstream task (signal) while the rest are distractors (noise). By framing pooling as vector quantization with the goal of minimizing signal loss, we demonstrate that the standard methods used to aggregate transformer outputs, AvgPool, MaxPool, and ClsToken, are vulnerable to performance collapse as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inputs fluctuates. We then show that an attention-based adaptive pooling method can approximate the signal-optimal vector quantizer within derived error bounds for any SNR. Our theoretical results are first validated by supervised experiments on a synthetic dataset designed to isolate the SNR problem, then generalized to standard relational reasoning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and vision benchmarks with noisy observations, where transformers with adaptive pooling display superior robustness across tasks.

Abstract: Transformer language models have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities in natural language domains, yet we lack a fine-grained understanding of how such generalization arises. In this paper, we investigate length generalization--the ability to extrapolate from shorter to longer inputs--through the lens of \textit{task association}. We find that length generalization can be \textit{transferred} across related tasks. That is, training a model with a longer and related auxiliary task can lead it to generalize to unseen and longer inputs from some other target task. We demonstrate this length generalization transfer across diverse algorithmic tasks, including arithmetic operations, string transformations, and maze navigation. Our results show that transformer models can inherit generalization capabilities from similar tasks when trained jointly. Moreover, we observe similar transfer effects in pretrained language models, suggesting that pretraining equips models with reusable computational scaffolding that facilitates extrapolation in downstream settings. Finally, we provide initial mechanistic evidence that length generalization transfer correlates with the re-use of the same attention heads between the tasks. Together, our findings deepen our understanding of how transformers generalize to out-of-distribution inputs and highlight the compositional reuse of inductive structure across tasks.

Abstract: Millions of players engage daily in competitive online games, communicating through in-game chat. Prior research has focused on detecting relatively small volumes of toxic content using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for the purpose of moderation. However, recent studies emphasize the importance of detecting prosocial communication, which can be as crucial as identifying toxic interactions. Recognizing prosocial behavior allows for its analysis, rewarding, and promotion. Unlike toxicity, there are limited datasets, models, and resources for identifying prosocial behaviors in game-chat text. In this work, we employed unsupervised discovery combined with game domain expert collaboration to identify and categorize prosocial player behaviors from game chat. We further propose a novel Self-Anchored Attention Model (SAAM) which gives 7.9% improvement compared to the best existing technique. The approach utilizes the entire training set as "anchors" to help improve model performance under the scarcity of training data. This approach led to the development of the first automated system for classifying prosocial behaviors in in-game chats, particularly given the low-resource settings where large-scale labeled data is not available. Our methodology was applied to one of the most popular online gaming titles - Call of Duty(R): Modern Warfare(R)II, showcasing its effectiveness. This research is novel in applying NLP techniques to discover and classify prosocial behaviors in player in-game chat communication. It can help shift the focus of moderation from solely penalizing toxicity to actively encouraging positive interactions on online platforms.

Abstract: Integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial network (TN-NTN) architectures offer a promising solution for expanding coverage and improving capacity for the network. While non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are primarily exploited for these specific reasons, their role in alleviating terrestrial network (TN) load and enabling energy-efficient operation has received comparatively less attention. In light of growing concerns associated with the densification of terrestrial deployments, this work aims to explore the potential of NTNs in supporting a more sustainable network. In this paper, we propose a novel online optimisation framework for integrated TN-NTN architectures, built on a multi-armed bandit (MAB) formulation and leveraging the Bandit-feedback Constrained Online Mirror Descent (BCOMD) algorithm. Our approach adaptively optimises key system parameters--including bandwidth allocation, user equipment (UE) association, and macro base station (MBS) shutdown--to balance network capacity and energy efficiency in real time. Extensive system-level simulations over a 24-hour period show that our framework significantly reduces the proportion of unsatisfied UEs during peak hours and achieves up to 19% throughput gains and 5% energy savings in low-traffic periods, outperforming standard network settings following 3GPP recommendations.

Abstract: This paper presents a state representation framework for Markov decision processes (MDPs) that can be learned solely from state trajectories, requiring neither reward signals nor the actions executed by the agent. We propose learning the minimum action distance (MAD), defined as the minimum number of actions required to transition between states, as a fundamental metric that captures the underlying structure of an environment. MAD naturally enables critical downstream tasks such as goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and reward shaping by providing a dense, geometrically meaningful measure of progress. Our self-supervised learning approach constructs an embedding space where the distances between embedded state pairs correspond to their MAD, accommodating both symmetric and asymmetric approximations. We evaluate the framework on a comprehensive suite of environments with known MAD values, encompassing both deterministic and stochastic dynamics, as well as discrete and continuous state spaces, and environments with noisy observations. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only efficiently learns accurate MAD representations across these diverse settings but also significantly outperforms existing state representation methods in terms of representation quality.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained object affordances is imperative for robots to manipulate objects in unstructured environments given open-ended task instructions. However, existing methods of visual affordance predictions often rely on manually annotated data or conditions only on a predefined set of tasks. We introduce UAD (Unsupervised Affordance Distillation), a method for distilling affordance knowledge from foundation models into a task-conditioned affordance model without any manual annotations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of large vision models and vision-language models, UAD automatically annotates a large-scale dataset with detailed $<$instruction, visual affordance$>$ pairs. Training only a lightweight task-conditioned decoder atop frozen features, UAD exhibits notable generalization to in-the-wild robotic scenes and to various human activities, despite only being trained on rendered objects in simulation. Using affordance provided by UAD as the observation space, we show an imitation learning policy that demonstrates promising generalization to unseen object instances, object categories, and even variations in task instructions after training on as few as 10 demonstrations.

Abstract: Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling (i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12% improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for higher rates of sub-sampling.

Abstract: Figurative language (e.g., irony, hyperbole, understatement) is ubiquitous in human communication, resulting in utterances where the literal and the intended meanings do not match. The Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which explicitly models speaker intentions, is the most widespread theory of probabilistic pragmatics, but existing implementations are either unable to account for figurative expressions or require modeling the implicit motivations for using figurative language (e.g., to express joy or annoyance) in a setting-specific way. In this paper, we introduce the Rhetorical-Strategy-Aware RSA $(RSA)^2$ framework which models figurative language use by considering a speaker's employed rhetorical strategy. We show that $(RSA)^2$ enables human-compatible interpretations of non-literal utterances without modeling a speaker's motivations for being non-literal. Combined with LLMs, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ironic split of PragMega+, a new irony interpretation dataset introduced in this study.

Abstract: Alzheimer's dementia (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with cognitive decline that commonly impacts language ability. This work extends the paired perplexity approach to detecting AD by using a recent large language model (LLM), the instruction-following version of Mistral-7B. We improve accuracy by an average of 3.33% over the best current paired perplexity method and by 6.35% over the top-ranked method from the ADReSS 2020 challenge benchmark. Our further analysis demonstrates that the proposed approach can effectively detect AD with a clear and interpretable decision boundary in contrast to other methods that suffer from opaque decision-making processes. Finally, by prompting the fine-tuned LLMs and comparing the model-generated responses to human responses, we illustrate that the LLMs have learned the special language patterns of AD speakers, which opens up possibilities for novel methods of model interpretation and data augmentation.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot and few-shot generalization capabilities across complex natural language tasks, enabling their widespread use as virtual assistants for diverse applications such as translation and summarization. Despite being trained solely on large corpora of text without explicit supervision on author intent, LLMs appear to infer the underlying meaning of textual interactions. This raises a fundamental question: can LLMs model and reason about the intentions of others, i.e., do they possess a form of theory of mind? Understanding other's intentions is crucial for effective collaboration, which underpins human societal success and is essential for cooperative interactions among multiple agents, including humans and autonomous systems. In this work, we investigate the theory of mind in LLMs through the lens of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where agents learn to collaborate via repeated interactions, mirroring human social reasoning. Our approach aims to enhance artificial agent's ability to adapt and cooperate with both artificial and human partners. By leveraging LLM-based agents capable of natural language interaction, we move towards creating hybrid human-AI systems that can foster seamless collaboration, with broad implications for the future of human-artificial interaction.

Abstract: The Intelligent System of Emergent Knowledge (ISEK) establishes a decentralized network where human and artificial intelligence agents collaborate as peers, forming a self-organizing cognitive ecosystem. Built on Web3 infrastructure, ISEK combines three fundamental principles: (1) a decentralized multi-agent architecture resistant to censorship, (2) symbiotic AI-human collaboration with equal participation rights, and (3) resilient self-adaptation through distributed consensus mechanisms.
  The system implements an innovative coordination protocol featuring a six-phase workflow (Publish, Discover, Recruit, Execute, Settle, Feedback) for dynamic task allocation, supported by robust fault tolerance and a multidimensional reputation system. Economic incentives are governed by the native $ISEK token, facilitating micropayments, governance participation, and reputation tracking, while agent sovereignty is maintained through NFT-based identity management.
  This synthesis of blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and incentive engineering creates an infrastructure that actively facilitates emergent intelligence. ISEK represents a paradigm shift from conventional platforms, enabling the organic development of large-scale, decentralized cognitive systems where autonomous agents collectively evolve beyond centralized constraints.

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) play a central role in guiding inference-time scaling algorithms for large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that even state-of-the-art PRMs can be poorly calibrated and often overestimate success probabilities. To address this, we present a calibration approach, performed via quantile regression, that adjusts PRM outputs to better align with true success probabilities. Leveraging these calibrated success estimates and their associated confidence bounds, we introduce an \emph{instance-adaptive scaling} (IAS) framework that dynamically adjusts the inference budget based on the estimated likelihood that a partial reasoning trajectory will yield a correct final answer. Unlike conventional methods that allocate a fixed number of reasoning trajectories per query, this approach successfully adapts to each instance and reasoning step when using our calibrated PRMs. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that (i) our PRM calibration method successfully achieves small calibration error, outperforming the baseline methods, (ii) calibration is crucial for enabling effective adaptive scaling, and (iii) the proposed IAS strategy reduces inference costs while maintaining final answer accuracy, utilizing less compute on more confident problems as desired.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is vital for optimizing large language models (LLMs). Recent Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) estimates advantages using multiple on-policy outputs per prompt, leading to high computational costs and low data efficiency. To address this, we introduce Replay-Enhanced Policy Optimization (RePO), which leverages diverse replay strategies to retrieve off-policy samples from a replay buffer, allowing policy optimization based on a broader and more diverse set of samples for each prompt. Experiments on five LLMs across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that RePO achieves absolute average performance gains of $18.4$ and $4.1$ points for Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and Qwen3-1.7B, respectively, compared to GRPO. Further analysis indicates that RePO increases computational cost by $15\%$ while raising the number of effective optimization steps by $48\%$ for Qwen3-1.7B, with both on-policy and off-policy sample numbers set to $8$. The repository can be accessed at https://github.com/SihengLi99/RePO.

Abstract: We present the first comprehensive study of latent multi-head attention (MLA) for small language models, revealing interesting efficiency-quality trade-offs. Training 30M-parameter GPT models on 100,000 synthetic stories, we benchmark three architectural variants: standard multi-head attention (MHA), MLA, and MLA with rotary positional embeddings (MLA+RoPE). Our key finding is that MLA+RoPE with half-rank latent dimensions (r = d/2) achieves a 45% KV-cache memory reduction while incurring only a 0.3% increase in validation loss (essentially matching MHA quality)- a Pareto improvement for memory constrained deployment. We further show that RoPE is crucial for MLA in small models: without it, MLA underperforms vanilla attention by 3-5%, but with RoPE, it surpasses vanilla by 2%. Inference benchmarks on NVIDIA A100 GPUs reveal that MLA with r=d/2 achieves a 1.4 times speedup over full-rank MLA while maintaining the memory savings. GPT-4 evaluations corroborate perplexity results, with ours achieving the highest quality scores (7.4/10) across grammar, creativity, and consistency metrics. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

<title>ErrorEraser: Unlearning Data Bias for Improved Continual Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09347</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.09347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) primarily aims to retain knowledge to prevent catastrophic forgetting and transfer knowledge to facilitate learning new tasks. Unlike traditional methods, we propose a novel perspective: CL not only needs to prevent forgetting, but also requires intentional forgetting.This arises from existing CL methods ignoring biases in real-world data, leading the model to learn spurious correlations that transfer and amplify across tasks. From feature extraction and prediction results, we find that data biases simultaneously reduce CL's ability to retain and transfer knowledge. To address this, we propose ErrorEraser, a universal plugin that removes erroneous memories caused by biases in CL, enhancing performance in both new and old tasks. ErrorEraser consists of two modules: Error Identification and Error Erasure. The former learns the probability density distribution of task data in the feature space without prior knowledge, enabling accurate identification of potentially biased samples. The latter ensures only erroneous knowledge is erased by shifting the decision space of representative outlier samples. Additionally, an incremental feature distribution learning strategy is designed to reduce the resource overhead during error identification in downstream tasks. Extensive experimental results show that ErrorEraser significantly mitigates the negative impact of data biases, achieving higher accuracy and lower forgetting rates across three types of CL methods. The code is available at https://github.com/diadai/ErrorEraser.

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

Abstract: Mental health is a growing global concern, prompting interest in AI-driven solutions to expand access to psychosocial support. Peer support, grounded in lived experience, offers a valuable complement to professional care. However, variability in training, effectiveness, and definitions raises concerns about quality, consistency, and safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) present new opportunities to enhance peer support interactions, particularly in real-time, text-based interactions. We present and evaluate an AI-supported system with an LLM-simulated distressed client, context-sensitive LLM-generated suggestions, and real-time emotion visualisations. 2 mixed-methods studies with 12 peer supporters and 5 mental health professionals (i.e., experts) examined the system's effectiveness and implications for practice. Both groups recognised its potential to enhance training and improve interaction quality. However, we found a key tension emerged: while peer supporters engaged meaningfully, experts consistently flagged critical issues in peer supporter responses, such as missed distress cues and premature advice-giving. This misalignment highlights potential limitations in current peer support training, especially in emotionally charged contexts where safety and fidelity to best practices are essential. Our findings underscore the need for standardised, psychologically grounded training, especially as peer support scales globally. They also demonstrate how LLM-supported systems can scaffold this development--if designed with care and guided by expert oversight. This work contributes to emerging conversations on responsible AI integration in mental health and the evolving role of LLMs in augmenting peer-delivered care.

Abstract: Peer support plays a vital role in expanding access to mental health care by providing empathetic, community-based support outside formal clinical systems. As digital platforms increasingly mediate such support, the design and impact of these technologies remain under-examined, particularly in Asian contexts. This paper presents findings from an interview study with 20 peer supporters in Singapore, who operate across diverse online, offline, and hybrid environments. Through a thematic analysis, we unpack how participants start, conduct, and sustain peer support, highlighting their motivations, emotional labour, and the sociocultural dimensions shaping their practices. Building on this grounded understanding, we surface design directions for culturally responsive digital tools that scaffold rather than supplant relational care. Drawing insights from qualitative accounts, we offer a situated perspective on how AI might responsibly augment peer support. This research contributes to human-centred computing by articulating the lived realities of peer supporters and proposing design implications for trustworthy and context-sensitive AI in mental health.

<title>SAGE: Exploring the Boundaries of Unsafe Concept Domain with Semantic-Augment Erasing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.09363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it, trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs. The code and weights will be open-sourced at https://github.com/KevinLight831/SAGE.

Abstract: While Generative AI has demonstrated strong potential and versatility in content generation, its application to educational contexts presents several challenges. Models often fail to align with curriculum standards and maintain grade-appropriate reading levels consistently. Furthermore, STEM education poses additional challenges in balancing scientific explanations with everyday language when introducing complex and abstract ideas and phenomena to younger students. In this work, we propose COGENT, a curriculum-oriented framework for generating grade-appropriate educational content. We incorporate three curriculum components (science concepts, core ideas, and learning objectives), control readability through length, vocabulary, and sentence complexity, and adopt a ``wonder-based'' approach to increase student engagement and interest. We conduct a multi-dimensional evaluation via both LLM-as-a-judge and human expert analysis. Experimental results show that COGENT consistently produces grade-appropriate passages that are comparable or superior to human references. Our work establishes a viable approach for scaling adaptive and high-quality learning resources.

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays a pivotal role across diverse domains, including cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, and industrial manufacturing, by identifying unexpected patterns that deviate from established norms in real-world data. Recent advancements in deep learning, specifically diffusion models (DMs), have sparked significant interest due to their ability to learn complex data distributions and generate high-fidelity samples, offering a robust framework for unsupervised AD. In this survey, we comprehensively review anomaly detection and generation with diffusion models (ADGDM), presenting a tutorial-style analysis of the theoretical foundations and practical implementations and spanning images, videos, time series, tabular, and multimodal data. Crucially, unlike existing surveys that often treat anomaly detection and generation as separate problems, we highlight their inherent synergistic relationship. We reveal how DMs enable a reinforcing cycle where generation techniques directly address the fundamental challenge of anomaly data scarcity, while detection methods provide critical feedback to improve generation fidelity and relevance, advancing both capabilities beyond their individual potential. A detailed taxonomy categorizes ADGDM methods based on anomaly scoring mechanisms, conditioning strategies, and architectural designs, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We final discuss key challenges including scalability and computational efficiency, and outline promising future directions such as efficient architectures, conditioning strategies, and integration with foundation models (e.g., visual-language models and large language models). By synthesizing recent advances and outlining open research questions, this survey aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging DMs for innovative AD solutions across diverse applications.

Abstract: The advent of autonomous agents is transforming interactions with Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) by employing natural language as a powerful intermediary. Despite the predominance of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods in current GUI agents for achieving spatial localization, these methods face substantial challenges due to their limited capacity to accurately perceive positional data. Existing strategies, such as reinforcement learning, often fail to assess positional accuracy effectively, thereby restricting their utility. In response, we introduce Location Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel approach that leverages locational data to optimize interaction preferences. LPO uses information entropy to predict interaction positions by focusing on zones rich in information. Besides, it further introduces a dynamic location reward function based on physical distance, reflecting the varying importance of interaction positions. Supported by Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), LPO facilitates an extensive exploration of GUI environments and significantly enhances interaction precision. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LPO's superior performance, achieving SOTA results across both offline benchmarks and real-world online evaluations. Our code will be made publicly available soon, at https://github.com/AIDC-AI/LPO.

Abstract: Balance control is important for human and bipedal robotic systems. While dynamic balance during locomotion has received considerable attention, quantitative understanding of static balance and falling remains limited. This work presents a hierarchical control pipeline for simulating human balance via a comprehensive whole-body musculoskeletal system. We identified spatiotemporal dynamics of balancing during stable standing, revealed the impact of muscle injury on balancing behavior, and generated fall contact patterns that aligned with clinical data. Furthermore, our simulated hip exoskeleton assistance demonstrated improvement in balance maintenance and reduced muscle effort under perturbation. This work offers unique muscle-level insights into human balance dynamics that are challenging to capture experimentally. It could provide a foundation for developing targeted interventions for individuals with balance impairments and support the advancement of humanoid robotic systems.

Abstract: This position paper proposes a fundamental shift in designing code generation models: treating reasoning depth as a controllable resource. Rather than being an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and act fast when possible.

Abstract: Regardless the advancements in device capabilities, efficient inferencing advanced large language models (LLMs) at the edge remains challenging due to limited device memory and power constraints. Existing strategies, such as aggressive quantization, pruning, or remote inference, trade accuracy for efficiency or lead to substantial cost burdens. This position paper introduces a new approach that leverages speculative decoding, previously viewed primarily as a decoding acceleration technique for autoregressive generation of LLMs, as a promising approach specifically adapted for edge computing by orchestrating computation across heterogeneous devices. We propose SLED, a method that allows lightweight edge devices to draft multiple candidate tokens locally using diverse draft models, while a single, shared edge server efficiently batches and verifies the tokens utilizing a more precise target model. This approach supports device heterogeneity and reduces server-side memory footprint by avoiding the need to deploy multiple target models. Our initial experiments with Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 5, and an RTX 6000 edge server indicate substantial benefits: significantly reduced latency, improved energy efficiency, and increased concurrent inference sessions, all without sacrificing model accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) benchmarks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to minor input perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate Token Constraint Decoding (TCD). This simple yet effective inference-time algorithm enforces alignment between token-level predictions to enhance robustness in noisy settings. Through extensive experiments on CommonsenseQA, MMLU, and MMLU-Pro, we show that TCD, especially when paired with prompt engineering (PE) fixes, significantly restores performance degraded by input noise, yielding up to +39\% absolute gains for weaker models like Gemma3 1B. Penalty sweep analyses further reveal that TCD implicitly regularizes overconfident outputs, with different models requiring distinct penalty schedules to maximize resilience. Our findings establish TCD as a practical, model-agnostic approach for improving reasoning stability under real-world imperfections and pave the way for more reliable deployment of LLMs in safety-critical or user-facing applications.

Abstract: In video understanding tasks, particularly those involving human motion, synthetic data generation often suffers from uncanny features, diminishing its effectiveness for training. Tasks such as sign language translation, gesture recognition, and human motion understanding in autonomous driving have thus been unable to exploit the full potential of synthetic data. This paper proposes a method for generating synthetic human action video data using pose transfer (specifically, controllable 3D Gaussian avatar models). We evaluate this method on the Toyota Smarthome and NTU RGB+D datasets and show that it improves performance in action recognition tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the method can effectively scale few-shot datasets, making up for groups underrepresented in the real training data and adding diverse backgrounds. We open-source the method along with RANDOM People, a dataset with videos and avatars of novel human identities for pose transfer crowd-sourced from the internet.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have significantly improved multimodal understanding and generation. However, these models still struggle to generate tightly interleaved image-text outputs, primarily due to the limited scale, quality and instructional richness of current training datasets. To address this, we introduce InterSyn, a large-scale multimodal dataset constructed using our Self-Evaluation with Iterative Refinement (SEIR) method. InterSyn features multi-turn, instruction-driven dialogues with tightly interleaved imagetext responses, providing rich object diversity and rigorous automated quality refinement, making it well-suited for training next-generation instruction-following LMMs. Furthermore, to address the lack of reliable evaluation tools capable of assessing interleaved multimodal outputs, we introduce SynJudge, an automatic evaluation model designed to quantitatively assess multimodal outputs along four dimensions: text content, image content, image quality, and image-text synergy.
  Experimental studies show that the SEIR method leads to substantially higher dataset quality compared to an otherwise identical process without refinement.
  Moreover, LMMs trained on InterSyn achieve uniform performance gains across all evaluation metrics, confirming InterSyn's utility for advancing multimodal systems.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), while enhancing large language models(LLMs)' instruction-following capabilities and domain-specific task adaptability, often diminishes their general capabilities. Moreover, due to the inaccessibility of original pre-training data, catastrophic forgetting tends to be exacerbated when third-party practitioners implement SFT on open-sourced models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, more cost-effective SFT method which could effectively reduce the risk of catastrophic forgetting without access to original SFT data. Our approach begins by reconstructing the likely SFT instruction distribution of the base model, followed by a multi-model screening process to select optimal data, which is then mixed with new data for SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our method preserves generalization capabilities in general domains while improving task-specific performance.

Abstract: The success of teams in robotics, nature, and society often depends on the division of labor among diverse specialists; however, a principled explanation for when such diversity surpasses a homogeneous team is still missing. Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, our goal is to study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneous Environment Design (HED), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Experiments in matrix games and an embodied Multi-Goal-Capture environment show that, despite the difference in settings, HED rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HED and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become crucial for modern NLP research and applications across various languages. However, the development of foundational models specifically tailored to the Russian language has been limited, primarily due to the significant computational resources required. This paper introduces the GigaChat family of Russian LLMs, available in various sizes, including base models and instruction-tuned versions. We provide a detailed report on the model architecture, pre-training process, and experiments to guide design choices. In addition, we evaluate their performance on Russian and English benchmarks and compare GigaChat with multilingual analogs. The paper presents a system demonstration of the top-performing models accessible via an API, a Telegram bot, and a Web interface. Furthermore, we have released three open GigaChat models in open-source (https://huggingface.co/ai-sage), aiming to expand NLP research opportunities and support the development of industrial solutions for the Russian language.

Abstract: We address the problem of video question answering (video QA) with temporal grounding in a weakly supervised setup, without any temporal annotations. Given a video and a question, we generate an open-ended answer grounded with the start and end time. For this task, we propose TOGA: a vision-language model for Temporally Grounded Open-Ended Video QA with Weak Supervision. We instruct-tune TOGA to jointly generate the answer and the temporal grounding. We operate in a weakly supervised setup where the temporal grounding annotations are not available. We generate pseudo labels for temporal grounding and ensure the validity of these labels by imposing a consistency constraint between the question of a grounding response and the response generated by a question referring to the same temporal segment. We notice that jointly generating the answers with the grounding improves performance on question answering as well as grounding. We evaluate TOGA on grounded QA and open-ended QA tasks. For grounded QA, we consider the NExT-GQA benchmark which is designed to evaluate weakly supervised grounded question answering. For open-ended QA, we consider the MSVD-QA and ActivityNet-QA benchmarks. We achieve state-of-the-art performance for both tasks on these benchmarks.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM), the ability to understand the mental states of oneself and others, remains a challenging area for large language models (LLMs), which often fail to predict human mental states accurately. In this paper, we introduce UniToMBench, a unified benchmark that integrates the strengths of SimToM and TOMBENCH to systematically improve and assess ToM capabilities in LLMs by integrating multi-interaction task designs and evolving story scenarios. Supported by a custom dataset of over 1,000 hand-written scenarios, UniToMBench combines perspective-taking techniques with diverse evaluation metrics to better stimulate social cognition in LLMs. Through evaluation, we observe that while models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o Mini show consistently high accuracy in tasks involving emotional and belief-related scenarios, with results usually above 80%, there is significant variability in their performance across knowledge-based tasks. These results highlight both the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in ToM-related tasks, underscoring the value of UniToMBench as a comprehensive tool for future development. Our code is publicly available here: https://github.com/Shamant/unifiedtombenchmark.

<title>Abstraction-Based Proof Production in Formal Verification of Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Modern verification tools for deep neural networks (DNNs) increasingly rely on abstraction to scale to realistic architectures. In parallel, proof production is becoming a critical requirement for increasing the reliability of DNN verification results. However, current proofproducing verifiers do not support abstraction-based reasoning, creating a gap between scalability and provable guarantees. We address this gap by introducing a novel framework for proof-producing abstraction-based DNN verification. Our approach modularly separates the verification task into two components: (i) proving the correctness of an abstract network, and (ii) proving the soundness of the abstraction with respect to the original DNN. The former can be handled by existing proof-producing verifiers, whereas we propose the first method for generating formal proofs for the latter. This preliminary work aims to enable scalable and trustworthy verification by supporting common abstraction techniques within a formal proof framework.

Abstract: Scenario-based testing is essential for validating the performance of autonomous driving (AD) systems. However, such testing is limited by the scarcity of long-tailed, safety-critical scenarios in existing datasets collected in the real world. To tackle the data issue, we propose the Adv-BMT framework, which augments real-world scenarios with diverse and realistic adversarial interactions. The core component of Adv-BMT is a bidirectional motion transformer (BMT) model to perform inverse traffic motion predictions, which takes agent information in the last time step of the scenario as input, and reconstruct the traffic in the inverse of chronological order until the initial time step. The Adv-BMT framework is a two-staged pipeline: it first conducts adversarial initializations and then inverse motion predictions. Different from previous work, we do not need any collision data for pretraining, and are able to generate realistic and diverse collision interactions. Our experimental results validate the quality of generated collision scenarios by Adv-BMT: training in our augmented dataset would reduce episode collision rates by 20\% compared to previous work.

Abstract: This paper presents a tutorial-style survey and implementation guide of BemaGANv2, an advanced GAN-based vocoder designed for high-fidelity and long-term audio generation. Built upon the original BemaGAN architecture, BemaGANv2 incorporates major architectural innovations by replacing traditional ResBlocks in the generator with the Anti-aliased Multi-Periodicity composition (AMP) module, which internally applies the Snake activation function to better model periodic structures. In the discriminator framework, we integrate the Multi-Envelope Discriminator (MED), a novel architecture we originally proposed, to extract rich temporal envelope features crucial for periodicity detection. Coupled with the Multi-Resolution Discriminator (MRD), this combination enables more accurate modeling of long-range dependencies in audio. We systematically evaluate various discriminator configurations, including MSD + MED, MSD + MRD, and MPD + MED + MRD, using objective metrics (FAD, SSIM, PLCC, MCD) and subjective evaluations (MOS, SMOS). This paper also provides a comprehensive tutorial on the model architecture, training methodology, and implementation to promote reproducibility. The code and pre-trained models are available at: https://github.com/dinhoitt/BemaGANv2.

Abstract: Designing protein sequences with optimal energetic stability is a key challenge in protein inverse folding, as current deep learning methods are primarily trained by maximizing sequence recovery rates, often neglecting the energy of the generated sequences. This work aims to overcome this limitation by developing a model that directly generates low-energy, stable protein sequences. We propose EnerBridge-DPO, a novel inverse folding framework focused on generating low-energy, high-stability protein sequences. Our core innovation lies in: First, integrating Markov Bridges with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), where energy-based preferences are used to fine-tune the Markov Bridge model. The Markov Bridge initiates optimization from an information-rich prior sequence, providing DPO with a pool of structurally plausible sequence candidates. Second, an explicit energy constraint loss is introduced, which enhances the energy-driven nature of DPO based on prior sequences, enabling the model to effectively learn energy representations from a wealth of prior knowledge and directly predict sequence energy values, thereby capturing quantitative features of the energy landscape. Our evaluations demonstrate that EnerBridge-DPO can design protein complex sequences with lower energy while maintaining sequence recovery rates comparable to state-of-the-art models, and accurately predicts $\Delta \Delta G$ values between various sequences.

<title>A Unified Theory of Compositionality, Modularity, and Interpretability in Markov Decision Processes</title>

Abstract: We introduce Option Kernel Bellman Equations (OKBEs) for a new reward-free Markov Decision Process. Rather than a value function, OKBEs directly construct and optimize a predictive map called a state-time option kernel (STOK) to maximize the probability of completing a goal while avoiding constraint violations. STOKs are compositional, modular, and interpretable initiation-to-termination transition kernels for policies in the Options Framework of Reinforcement Learning. This means: 1) STOKs can be composed using Chapman-Kolmogorov equations to make spatiotemporal predictions for multiple policies over long horizons, 2) high-dimensional STOKs can be represented and computed efficiently in a factorized and reconfigurable form, and 3) STOKs record the probabilities of semantically interpretable goal-success and constraint-violation events, needed for formal verification. Given a high-dimensional state-transition model for an intractable planning problem, we can decompose it with local STOKs and goal-conditioned policies that are aggregated into a factorized goal kernel, making it possible to forward-plan at the level of goals in high-dimensions to solve the problem. These properties lead to highly flexible agents that can rapidly synthesize meta-policies, reuse planning representations across many tasks, and justify goals using empowerment, an intrinsic motivation function. We argue that reward-maximization is in conflict with the properties of compositionality, modularity, and interpretability. Alternatively, OKBEs facilitate these properties to support verifiable long-horizon planning and intrinsic motivation that scales to dynamic high-dimensional world-models.

<title>TransXSSM: A Hybrid Transformer State Space Model with Unified Rotary Position Embedding</title>

Abstract: Transformers exhibit proficiency in capturing long-range dependencies, whereas State Space Models (SSMs) facilitate linear-time sequence modeling. Notwithstanding their synergistic potential, the integration of these architectures presents a significant challenge, primarily attributable to a fundamental incongruity in their respective positional encoding mechanisms: Transformers rely on explicit Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), while SSMs leverage implicit positional representations via convolutions. This divergence often precipitates discontinuities and suboptimal performance. To address this impediment, we propose a unified rotary position embedding (\textbf{\ourRoPE}) methodology, thereby establishing a consistent positional encoding framework for both self-attention and state-space components. Using this \ourRoPE, we introduce \textbf{\model}, a hybrid architecture that coherently integrates the Transformer and SSM layers under this unified positional encoding scheme. At a 4K sequence length, \model exhibits training and inference speeds that are \textbf{42.3\% and 29.5\% faster}, respectively, relative to standard Transformer models. It also delivers higher accuracy: under comparable settings, it surpasses a Transformer baseline by over 4\% on language modeling benchmarks. \model furthermore scales more effectively: \model-1.3B gains \textbf{7.22\%} in average accuracy over its 320M version (versus about 6\% gains for equivalent Transformers or SSMs). Our results show that unified positional encoding resolves positional incompatibility in hybrid models, enabling efficient, high-performance long-context modeling.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning from human feedback in general Markov decision processes, where agents learn from trajectory-level preference comparisons. A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions. To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.

Abstract: Though reasoning-based large language models (LLMs) have excelled in mathematics and programming, their capabilities in knowledge-intensive medical question answering remain underexplored. To address this, we introduce ReasonMed, the largest medical reasoning dataset, comprising 370k high-quality examples distilled from 1.7 million initial reasoning paths generated by various LLMs. ReasonMed is constructed through a \textit{multi-agent verification and refinement process}, where we design an \textit{Error Refiner} to enhance the reasoning paths by identifying and correcting error-prone steps flagged by a verifier. Leveraging ReasonMed, we systematically investigate best practices for training medical reasoning models and find that combining detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning with concise answer summaries yields the most effective fine-tuning strategy. Based on this strategy, we train ReasonMed-7B, which sets a new benchmark for sub-10B models, outperforming the prior best by 4.17\% and even exceeding LLaMA3.1-70B on PubMedQA by 4.60\%.

<title>How attention simplifies mental representations for planning</title>

Abstract: Human planning is efficient -- it frugally deploys limited cognitive resources to accomplish difficult tasks -- and flexible -- adapting to novel problems and environments. Computational approaches suggest that people construct simplified mental representations of their environment, balancing the complexity of a task representation with its utility. These models imply a nested optimisation in which planning shapes perception, and perception shapes planning -- but the perceptual and attentional mechanisms governing how this interaction unfolds remain unknown. Here, we harness virtual maze navigation to characterise how spatial attention controls which aspects of a task representation enter subjective awareness and are available for planning. We find that spatial proximity governs which aspects of a maze are available for planning, and that when task-relevant information follows natural (lateralised) contours of attention, people can more easily construct simplified and useful maze representations. This influence of attention varies considerably across individuals, explaining differences in people's task representations and behaviour. Inspired by the 'spotlight of attention' analogy, we incorporate the effects of visuospatial attention into existing computational accounts of value-guided construal. Together, our work bridges computational perspectives on perception and decision-making to better understand how individuals represent their environments in aid of planning.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, conventional decoding strategies of LVLMs often fail to successfully utilize visual information, leading to visually ungrounded responses. While various approaches have been proposed to address this limitation, they typically require additional training, multi-step inference procedures, or external model dependencies. This paper introduces ReVisiT, a simple yet effective decoding method that references vision tokens to guide the text generation process in LVLMs. Our approach leverages the semantic information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text token distribution space, and dynamically selecting the most relevant vision token at each decoding step through constrained divergence minimization. This selected vision token is then used to refine the output distribution to better incorporate visual semantics. Experiments on three LVLM hallucination benchmarks with two recent LVLMs demonstrate that ReVisiT consistently enhances visual grounding with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieves competitive or superior results relative to state-of-the-art baselines while reducing computational costs for up to $2\times$.

Abstract: As function approximators, deep neural networks have served as an effective tool to represent various signal types. Recent approaches utilize multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to learn a nonlinear mapping from a coordinate to its corresponding signal, facilitating the learning of continuous neural representations from discrete data points. Despite notable successes in learning diverse signal types, coordinate-based MLPs often face issues of overfitting and limited generalizability beyond the training region, resulting in subpar extrapolation performance. This study addresses scenarios where the underlying true signals exhibit periodic properties, either spatially or temporally. We propose a novel network architecture, which extracts periodic patterns from measurements and leverages this information to represent the signal, thereby enhancing generalization and improving extrapolation performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments, including the learning of the periodic solutions for differential equations, and time series imputation (interpolation) and forecasting (extrapolation) on real-world datasets.

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.

Abstract: In this letter, we present tightly coupled LiDAR-IMU-leg odometry, which is robust to challenging conditions such as featureless environments and deformable terrains. We developed an online learning-based leg kinematics model named the neural leg kinematics model, which incorporates tactile information (foot reaction force) to implicitly express the nonlinear dynamics between robot feet and the ground. Online training of this model enhances its adaptability to weight load changes of a robot (e.g., assuming delivery or transportation tasks) and terrain conditions. According to the \textit{neural adaptive leg odometry factor} and online uncertainty estimation of the leg kinematics model-based motion predictions, we jointly solve online training of this kinematics model and odometry estimation on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of both. The proposed method was verified through real experiments using a quadruped robot in two challenging situations: 1) a sandy beach, representing an extremely featureless area with a deformable terrain, and 2) a campus, including multiple featureless areas and terrain types of asphalt, gravel (deformable terrain), and grass. Experimental results showed that our odometry estimation incorporating the \textit{neural leg kinematics model} outperforms state-of-the-art works.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful approach to enhance the structured, multi-step decision-making capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Models (MLLMs), is particularly crucial for autonomous driving with adverse weather conditions and complex traffic environments. However, existing benchmarks have largely overlooked the need for rigorous evaluation of CoT processes in these specific and challenging scenarios. To address this critical gap, we introduce AD^2-Bench, the first Chain-of-Thought benchmark specifically designed for autonomous driving with adverse weather and complex scenes. AD^2-Bench is meticulously constructed to fulfill three key criteria: comprehensive data coverage across diverse adverse environments, fine-grained annotations that support multi-step reasoning, and a dedicated evaluation framework tailored for assessing CoT performance. The core contribution of AD^2-Bench is its extensive collection of over 5.4k high-quality, manually annotated CoT instances. Each intermediate reasoning step in these annotations is treated as an atomic unit with explicit ground truth, enabling unprecedented fine-grained analysis of MLLMs' inferential processes under text-level, point-level, and region-level visual prompts. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on AD^2-Bench reveals accuracy below 60%, highlighting the benchmark's difficulty and the need to advance robust, interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving systems. AD^2-Bench thus provides a standardized evaluation platform, driving research forward by improving MLLMs' reasoning in autonomous driving, making it an invaluable resource.

Abstract: Integrating structured knowledge from Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) enhances factual grounding and reasoning capabilities. This survey paper systematically examines the synergy between KGs and LLMs, categorizing existing approaches into two main groups: KG-enhanced LLMs, which improve reasoning, reduce hallucinations, and enable complex question answering; and LLM-augmented KGs, which facilitate KG construction, completion, and querying. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify critical gaps and highlight the mutual benefits of structured knowledge integration. Compared to existing surveys, our study uniquely emphasizes scalability, computational efficiency, and data quality. Finally, we propose future research directions, including neuro-symbolic integration, dynamic KG updating, data reliability, and ethical considerations, paving the way for intelligent systems capable of managing more complex real-world knowledge tasks.

Abstract: Task-oriented LLM-based agents are increasingly used in domains with strict policies, such as refund eligibility or cancellation rules. The challenge lies in ensuring that the agent consistently adheres to these rules and policies, appropriately refusing any request that would violate them, while still maintaining a helpful and natural interaction. This calls for the development of tailored design and evaluation methodologies to ensure agent resilience against malicious user behavior. We propose a novel threat model that focuses on adversarial users aiming to exploit policy-adherent agents for personal benefit. To address this, we present CRAFT, a multi-agent red-teaming system that leverages policy-aware persuasive strategies to undermine a policy-adherent agent in a customer-service scenario, outperforming conventional jailbreak methods such as DAN prompts, emotional manipulation, and coercive. Building upon the existing tau-bench benchmark, we introduce tau-break, a complementary benchmark designed to rigorously assess the agent's robustness against manipulative user behavior. Finally, we evaluate several straightforward yet effective defense strategies. While these measures provide some protection, they fall short, highlighting the need for stronger, research-driven safeguards to protect policy-adherent agents from adversarial attacks

Abstract: Automated 3D CT diagnosis empowers clinicians to make timely, evidence-based decisions by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and workflow efficiency. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit promising performance in visual-language understanding, existing methods mainly focus on 2D medical images, which fundamentally limits their ability to capture complex 3D anatomical structures. This limitation often leads to misinterpretation of subtle pathologies and causes diagnostic hallucinations. In this paper, we present Hybrid Spatial Encoding Network (HSENet), a framework that exploits enriched 3D medical visual cues by effective visual perception and projection for accurate and robust vision-language understanding. Specifically, HSENet employs dual-3D vision encoders to perceive both global volumetric contexts and fine-grained anatomical details, which are pre-trained by dual-stage alignment with diagnostic reports. Furthermore, we propose Spatial Packer, an efficient multimodal projector that condenses high-resolution 3D spatial regions into a compact set of informative visual tokens via centroid-based compression. By assigning spatial packers with dual-3D vision encoders, HSENet can seamlessly perceive and transfer hybrid visual representations to LLM's semantic space, facilitating accurate diagnostic text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D language-visual retrieval (39.85% of R@100, +5.96% gain), 3D medical report generation (24.01% of BLEU-4, +8.01% gain), and 3D visual question answering (73.60% of Major Class Accuracy, +1.99% gain), confirming its effectiveness.

Abstract: Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.

Abstract: End-to-end deep learning exhibits unmatched performance for detecting malware, but such an achievement is reached by exploiting spurious correlations -- features with high relevance at inference time, but known to be useless through domain knowledge. While previous work highlighted that deep networks mainly focus on metadata, none investigated the phenomenon further, without quantifying their impact on the decision. In this work, we deepen our understanding of how spurious correlation affects deep learning for malware detection by highlighting how much models rely on empty spaces left by the compiler, which diminishes the relevance of the compiled code. Through our seminal analysis on a small-scale balanced dataset, we introduce a ranking of two end-to-end models to better understand which is more suitable to be put in production.

<title>Is Fine-Tuning an Effective Solution? Reassessing Knowledge Editing for Unstructured Data</title>

Abstract: Unstructured Knowledge Editing (UKE) is crucial for updating the relevant knowledge of large language models (LLMs). It focuses on unstructured inputs, such as long or free-form texts, which are common forms of real-world knowledge. Although previous studies have proposed effective methods and tested them, some issues exist: (1) Lack of Locality evaluation for UKE, and (2) Abnormal failure of fine-tuning (FT) based methods for UKE. To address these issues, we first construct two datasets, UnKEBench-Loc and AKEW-Loc (CF), by extending two existing UKE datasets with locality test data from the unstructured and structured views. This enables a systematic evaluation of the Locality of post-edited models. Furthermore, we identify four factors that may affect the performance of FT-based methods. Based on these factors, we conduct experiments to determine how the well-performing FT-based methods should be trained for the UKE task, providing a training recipe for future research. Our experimental results indicate that the FT-based method with the optimal setting (FT-UKE) is surprisingly strong, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA). In batch editing scenarios, FT-UKE shows strong performance as well, with its advantage over SOTA methods increasing as the batch size grows, expanding the average metric lead from +6.78% to +10.80%

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric models promise improved robustness through mechanisms such as chain-of-thought prompting and test-time scaling. However, their ability to withstand misleading user input remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art reasoning models, i.e., OpenAI's o4-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across three multimodal benchmarks: MMMU, MathVista, and CharXiv. Our evaluation reveals significant accuracy drops (25-29% on average) following gaslighting negation prompts, indicating that even top-tier reasoning models struggle to preserve correct answers under manipulative user feedback. Built upon the insights of the evaluation and to further probe this vulnerability, we introduce GaslightingBench-R, a new diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to evaluate reasoning models' susceptibility to defend their belief under gaslighting negation prompt. Constructed by filtering and curating 1,025 challenging samples from the existing benchmarks, GaslightingBench-R induces even more dramatic failures, with accuracy drops exceeding 53% on average. Our findings reveal fundamental limitations in the robustness of reasoning models, highlighting the gap between step-by-step reasoning and belief persistence.

<title>Towards Practical Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis: A Lightweight and Interpretable Spiking Neural Model</title>

Abstract: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), especially at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, is vital yet hindered by subjective assessments and the high cost of multimodal imaging modalities. Although deep learning methods offer automated alternatives, their energy inefficiency and computational demands limit real-world deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings. As a brain-inspired paradigm, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are inherently well-suited for modeling the sparse, event-driven patterns of neural degeneration in AD, offering a promising foundation for interpretable and low-power medical diagnostics. However, existing SNNs often suffer from weak expressiveness and unstable training, which restrict their effectiveness in complex medical tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FasterSNN, a hybrid neural architecture that integrates biologically inspired LIF neurons with region-adaptive convolution and multi-scale spiking attention. This design enables sparse, efficient processing of 3D MRI while preserving diagnostic accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FasterSNN achieves competitive performance with substantially improved efficiency and stability, supporting its potential for practical AD screening.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and other neural architectures have achieved impressive results across a variety of generative and classification tasks. However, they remain fundamentally ill-equipped to ensure that their outputs satisfy temporal constraints, such as those expressible in Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf). In this paper, we introduce TRIDENT: a general and model-agnostic inference-time algorithm that guarantees compliance with such constraints without requiring any retraining. TRIDENT compiles LTLf formulas into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), which is used to guide a constrained variant of beam search. At each decoding step, transitions that would lead to constraint violations are masked, while remaining paths are dynamically re-ranked based on both the model's probabilities and the DFA's acceptance structure. We formally prove that the resulting sequences are guaranteed to satisfy the given LTLf constraints, and we empirically demonstrate that TRIDENT also improves output quality. We validate our approach on two distinct tasks: temporally constrained image-stream classification and controlled text generation. In both settings, TRIDENT achieves perfect constraint satisfaction, while comparison with the state of the art shows improved efficiency and high standard quality metrics.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables non-contact, continuous monitoring of physiological signals and offers a practical alternative to traditional health sensing methods. Although rPPG is promising for daily health monitoring, its application in long-term personal care scenarios, such as mirror-facing routines in high-altitude environments, remains challenging due to ambient lighting variations, frequent occlusions from hand movements, and dynamic facial postures. To address these challenges, we present LADH (Long-term Altitude Daily Health), the first long-term rPPG dataset containing 240 synchronized RGB and infrared (IR) facial videos from 21 participants across five common personal care scenarios, along with ground-truth PPG, respiration, and blood oxygen signals. Our experiments demonstrate that combining RGB and IR video inputs improves the accuracy and robustness of non-contact physiological monitoring, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.99 BPM in heart rate estimation. Furthermore, we find that multi-task learning enhances performance across multiple physiological indicators simultaneously. Dataset and code are open at https://github.com/McJackTang/FusionVitals.

<title>AtmosMJ: Revisiting Gating Mechanism for AI Weather Forecasting Beyond the Year Scale</title>

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.

<title>Vision Matters: Simple Visual Perturbations Can Boost Multimodal Math Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they have largely overlooked the importance of visual processing. In a simple yet revealing experiment, we interestingly find that language-only models, when provided with image captions, can achieve comparable or even better performance than MLLMs that consume raw visual inputs. This suggests that current MLLMs may generate accurate visual descriptions but fail to effectively integrate them during reasoning. Motivated by this, we propose a simple visual perturbation framework that enhances perceptual robustness without requiring algorithmic modifications or additional training data. Our approach introduces three targeted perturbations: distractor concatenation, dominance-preserving mixup, and random rotation, that can be easily integrated into existing post-training pipelines including SFT, DPO, and GRPO. Through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, we demonstrate consistent improvements in mathematical reasoning performance, with gains comparable to those achieved through algorithmic changes. Additionally, we achieve competitive performance among open-source 7B RL-tuned models by training Qwen2.5-VL-7B with visual perturbation. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze the effectiveness of different perturbation strategies, revealing that each perturbation type contributes uniquely to different aspects of visual reasoning. Our findings highlight the critical role of visual perturbation in multimodal mathematical reasoning: better reasoning begins with better seeing.

<title>ELBO-T2IAlign: A Generic ELBO-Based Method for Calibrating Pixel-level Text-Image Alignment in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at image generation. Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.

Abstract: Monitoring Machine Learning (ML) models in production environments is crucial, yet traditional approaches often yield verbose, low-interpretability outputs that hinder effective decision-making. We propose a cognitive architecture for ML monitoring that applies feature engineering principles to agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly enhancing the interpretability of monitoring outputs. Central to our approach is a Decision Procedure module that simulates feature engineering through three key steps: Refactor, Break Down, and Compile. The Refactor step improves data representation to better capture feature semantics, allowing the LLM to focus on salient aspects of the monitoring data while reducing noise and irrelevant information. Break Down decomposes complex information for detailed analysis, and Compile integrates sub-insights into clear, interpretable outputs. This process leads to a more deterministic planning approach, reducing dependence on LLM-generated planning, which can sometimes be inconsistent and overly general. The combination of feature engineering-driven planning and selective LLM utilization results in a robust decision support system, capable of providing highly interpretable and actionable insights. Experiments using multiple LLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving significantly higher accuracy compared to various baselines across several domains.

Abstract: In complex engineering systems, the interdependencies among components or development activities are often modeled and analyzed using Design Structure Matrix (DSM). Reorganizing elements within a DSM to minimize feedback loops and enhance modularity or process efficiency constitutes a challenging combinatorial optimization (CO) problem in engineering design and operations. As problem sizes increase and dependency networks become more intricate, traditional optimization methods that solely use mathematical heuristics often fail to capture the contextual nuances and struggle to deliver effective solutions. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for helping solve such CO problems by leveraging their capabilities for advanced reasoning and contextual understanding. We propose a novel LLM-based framework that integrates network topology with contextual domain knowledge for iterative optimization of DSM element sequencing - a common CO problem. Experiments on various DSM cases show that our method consistently achieves faster convergence and superior solution quality compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines. Notably, we find that incorporating contextual domain knowledge significantly enhances optimization performance regardless of the chosen LLM backbone. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs to solve complex engineering CO problems by combining semantic and mathematical reasoning. This approach paves the way towards a new paradigm in LLM-based engineering design optimization.

Abstract: Research and practice in Intelligent Design (ID) have significantly enhanced engineering innovation, efficiency, quality, and productivity over recent decades, fundamentally reshaping how engineering designers think, behave, and interact with design processes. The recent emergence of Foundation Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has demonstrated general knowledge-based reasoning capabilities, and open new paths and avenues for further transformation in engineering design. In this context, this paper introduces Intelligent Design 4.0 (ID 4.0) as an emerging paradigm empowered by agentic AI systems. We review the historical evolution of ID across four distinct stages: rule-based expert systems, task-specific machine learning models, large-scale foundation AI models, and the recent emerging paradigm of multi-agent collaboration. We propose a conceptual framework for ID 4.0 and discuss its potential to support end-to-end automation of engineering design processes through coordinated, autonomous multi-agent-based systems. Furthermore, we discuss future perspectives to enhance and fully realize ID 4.0's potential, including more complex design scenarios, more practical design implementations, novel agent coordination mechanisms, and autonomous design goal-setting with better human value alignment. In sum, these insights lay a foundation for advancing Intelligent Design toward greater adaptivity, autonomy, and effectiveness in addressing increasingly complex design challenges.

Abstract: This paper proposes Load-aware Tram-FL, an extension of Tram-FL that introduces a training scheduling mechanism to minimize total training time in decentralized federated learning by accounting for both computational and communication loads. The scheduling problem is formulated as a global optimization task, which-though intractable in its original form-is made solvable by decomposing it into node-wise subproblems. To promote balanced data utilization under non-IID distributions, a variance constraint is introduced, while the overall training latency, including both computation and communication costs, is minimized through the objective function. Simulation results on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that Load-aware Tram-FL significantly reduces training time and accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Despite this highly limited information, experiments on LFW, AgeDB-30, and CFP-FP benchmarks demonstrate that DarkerBB achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracies in the similarity-only setting, with competitive query efficiency.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has gained significant attention as a foundational approach for promptable image and video segmentation. However, its expensive computational and memory consumption poses a severe challenge for its application in resource-constrained scenarios. In this paper, we propose an accurate low-bit quantization method for efficient SAM2, termed Q-SAM2. To address the performance degradation caused by the singularities in weight and activation distributions during quantization, Q-SAM2 introduces two novel technical contributions. We first introduce a linear layer calibration method for low-bit initialization of SAM2, which minimizes the Frobenius norm over a small image batch to reposition weight distributions for improved quantization. We then propose a Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) pipeline that applies clipping to suppress outliers and allows the network to adapt to quantization thresholds during training. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Q-SAM2 allows for highly accurate inference while substantially improving efficiency. Both quantitative and visual results show that our Q-SAM2 surpasses existing state-of-the-art general quantization schemes, especially for ultra-low 2-bit quantization. While designed for quantization-aware training, our proposed calibration technique also proves effective in post-training quantization, achieving up to a 66% mIoU accuracy improvement over non-calibrated models.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains, remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data}, which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures} between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\% and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about 30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model compared with the natural language models.

Abstract: In this short note, we report and analyze a striking event: OpenAI's large language model o3 has outwitted all students in a university exam on thermodynamics. The thermodynamics exam is a difficult hurdle for most students, where they must show that they have mastered the fundamentals of this important topic. Consequently, the failure rates are very high, A-grades are rare - and they are considered proof of the students' exceptional intellectual abilities. This is because pattern learning does not help in the exam. The problems can only be solved by knowledgeably and creatively combining principles of thermodynamics. We have given our latest thermodynamics exam not only to the students but also to OpenAI's most powerful reasoning model, o3, and have assessed the answers of o3 exactly the same way as those of the students. In zero-shot mode, the model o3 solved all problems correctly, better than all students who took the exam; its overall score was in the range of the best scores we have seen in more than 10,000 similar exams since 1985. This is a turning point: machines now excel in complex tasks, usually taken as proof of human intellectual capabilities. We discuss the consequences this has for the work of engineers and the education of future engineers.

Abstract: The advancement of text-to-speech and audio generation models necessitates robust benchmarks for evaluating the emotional understanding capabilities of AI systems. Current speech emotion recognition (SER) datasets often exhibit limitations in emotional granularity, privacy concerns, or reliance on acted portrayals. This paper introduces EmoNet-Voice, a new resource for speech emotion detection, which includes EmoNet-Voice Big, a large-scale pre-training dataset (featuring over 4,500 hours of speech across 11 voices, 40 emotions, and 4 languages), and EmoNet-Voice Bench, a novel benchmark dataset with human expert annotations. EmoNet-Voice is designed to evaluate SER models on a fine-grained spectrum of 40 emotion categories with different levels of intensities. Leveraging state-of-the-art voice generation, we curated synthetic audio snippets simulating actors portraying scenes designed to evoke specific emotions. Crucially, we conducted rigorous validation by psychology experts who assigned perceived intensity labels. This synthetic, privacy-preserving approach allows for the inclusion of sensitive emotional states often absent in existing datasets. Lastly, we introduce Empathic Insight Voice models that set a new standard in speech emotion recognition with high agreement with human experts. Our evaluations across the current model landscape exhibit valuable findings, such as high-arousal emotions like anger being much easier to detect than low-arousal states like concentration.

Abstract: Reconstructing intricate, ever-changing environments remains a central ambition in computer vision, yet existing solutions often crumble before the complexity of real-world dynamics. We present DynaSplat, an approach that extends Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes by integrating dynamic-static separation and hierarchical motion modeling. First, we classify scene elements as static or dynamic through a novel fusion of deformation offset statistics and 2D motion flow consistency, refining our spatial representation to focus precisely where motion matters. We then introduce a hierarchical motion modeling strategy that captures both coarse global transformations and fine-grained local movements, enabling accurate handling of intricate, non-rigid motions. Finally, we integrate physically-based opacity estimation to ensure visually coherent reconstructions, even under challenging occlusions and perspective shifts. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets reveal that DynaSplat not only surpasses state-of-the-art alternatives in accuracy and realism but also provides a more intuitive, compact, and efficient route to dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Embodied navigation stands as a foundation pillar within the broader pursuit of embodied AI. However, previous navigation research is divided into different tasks/capabilities, e.g., ObjNav, ImgNav and VLN, where they differ in task objectives and modalities, making datasets and methods are designed individually. In this work, we take steps toward generalist navigation agents, which can follow free-form instructions that include arbitrary compounds of multi-modal and multi-capability. To achieve this, we propose a large-scale benchmark and corresponding method, termed OctoNav-Bench and OctoNav-R1. Specifically, OctoNav-Bench features continuous environments and is constructed via a designed annotation pipeline. We thoroughly craft instruction-trajectory pairs, where instructions are diverse in free-form with arbitrary modality and capability. Also, we construct a Think-Before-Action (TBA-CoT) dataset within OctoNav-Bench to provide the thinking process behind actions. For OctoNav-R1, we build it upon MLLMs and adapt it to a VLA-type model, which can produce low-level actions solely based on 2D visual observations. Moreover, we design a Hybrid Training Paradigm (HTP) that consists of three stages, i.e., Action-/TBA-SFT, Nav-GPRO, and Online RL stages. Each stage contains specifically designed learning policies and rewards. Importantly, for TBA-SFT and Nav-GRPO designs, we are inspired by the OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, which show impressive reasoning ability via thinking-before-answer. Thus, we aim to investigate how to achieve thinking-before-action in the embodied navigation field, to improve model's reasoning ability toward generalists. Specifically, we propose TBA-SFT to utilize the TBA-CoT dataset to fine-tune the model as a cold-start phrase and then leverage Nav-GPRO to improve its thinking ability. Finally, OctoNav-R1 shows superior performance compared with previous methods.

<title>Learning to Align: Addressing Character Frequency Distribution Shifts in Handwritten Text Recognition</title>

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions, often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting generalization and performance. We open source our code at https://github.com/pkaliosis/fada.

Abstract: Out-of-context and misattributed imagery is the leading form of media manipulation in today's misinformation and disinformation landscape. The existing methods attempting to detect this practice often only consider whether the semantics of the imagery corresponds to the text narrative, missing manipulation so long as the depicted objects or scenes somewhat correspond to the narrative at hand. To tackle this, we introduce News Media Provenance Dataset, a dataset of news articles with provenance-tagged images. We formulate two tasks on this dataset, location of origin relevance (LOR) and date and time of origin relevance (DTOR), and present baseline results on six large language models (LLMs). We identify that, while the zero-shot performance on LOR is promising, the performance on DTOR hinders, leaving room for specialized architectures and future work.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting plays an indispensable role in endowing large language models (LLMs) with complex reasoning capabilities. However, CoT currently faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Sufficiency, which ensures that the generated intermediate inference steps comprehensively cover and substantiate the final conclusion; and (2) Necessity, which identifies the inference steps that are truly indispensable for the soundness of the resulting answer. We propose a causal framework that characterizes CoT reasoning through the dual lenses of sufficiency and necessity. Incorporating causal Probability of Sufficiency and Necessity allows us not only to determine which steps are logically sufficient or necessary to the prediction outcome, but also to quantify their actual influence on the final reasoning outcome under different intervention scenarios, thereby enabling the automated addition of missing steps and the pruning of redundant ones. Extensive experimental results on various mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks confirm substantial improvements in reasoning efficiency and reduced token usage without sacrificing accuracy. Our work provides a promising direction for improving LLM reasoning performance and cost-effectiveness.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective for processing graph-structured data but face challenges with large graphs due to high memory requirements and inefficient sparse matrix operations on GPUs. Quantum Computing (QC) offers a promising avenue to address these issues and inspires new algorithmic approaches. In particular, Quantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs) have been explored in recent literature. However, current quantum hardware limits the dimension of the data that can be effectively encoded. Existing approaches either simplify datasets manually or use artificial graph datasets. This work introduces the Guided Graph Compression (GGC) framework, which uses a graph autoencoder to reduce both the number of nodes and the dimensionality of node features. The compression is guided to enhance the performance of a downstream classification task, which can be applied either with a quantum or a classical classifier. The framework is evaluated on the Jet Tagging task, a classification problem of fundamental importance in high energy physics that involves distinguishing particle jets initiated by quarks from those by gluons. The GGC is compared against using the autoencoder as a standalone preprocessing step and against a baseline classical GNN classifier. Our numerical results demonstrate that GGC outperforms both alternatives, while also facilitating the testing of novel QGNN ansatzes on realistic datasets.

Abstract: Responsible AI (rAI) guidance increasingly promotes stakeholder involvement (SHI) during AI development. At the same time, SHI is already common in commercial software development, but with potentially different foci. This study clarifies the extent to which established SHI practices are able to contribute to rAI efforts as well as potential disconnects -- essential insights to inform and tailor future interventions that further shift industry practice towards rAI efforts. First, we analysed 56 rAI guidance documents to identify why SHI is recommended (i.e. its expected benefits for rAI) and uncovered goals such as redistributing power, improving socio-technical understandings, anticipating risks, and enhancing public oversight. To understand why and how SHI is currently practised in commercial settings, we then conducted an online survey (n=130) and semi-structured interviews (n=10) with AI practitioners. Our findings reveal that SHI in practice is primarily driven by commercial priorities (e.g. customer value, compliance) and several factors currently discourage more rAI-aligned SHI practices. This suggests that established SHI practices are largely not contributing to rAI efforts. To address this disconnect, we propose interventions and research opportunities to advance rAI development in practice.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance on diverse visual and linguistic tasks, yet they remain fundamentally limited in their understanding of 3D spatial structures. We propose Geometric Distillation, a lightweight, annotation-free fine-tuning framework that injects human-inspired geometric cues into pretrained VLMs without modifying their architecture. By distilling (1) sparse correspondences, (2) relative depth relations, and (3) dense cost volumes from off-the-shelf 3D foundation models (e.g., MASt3R, VGGT), our method shapes representations to be geometry-aware while remaining compatible with natural image-text inputs. Through extensive evaluations on 3D vision-language reasoning and 3D perception benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving improved 3D spatial reasoning with significantly lower computational cost. Our work demonstrates a scalable and efficient path to bridge 2D-trained VLMs with 3D understanding, opening up wider use in spatially grounded multimodal tasks.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) by analyzing the probabilistic divergence between prompt and response hidden-state distributions. Counterintuitively, we find that hallucinated responses exhibit smaller deviations from their prompts compared to grounded responses, suggesting that hallucinations often arise from superficial rephrasing rather than substantive reasoning. Leveraging this insight, we propose a model-intrinsic detection method that uses distributional distances as principled hallucination scores, eliminating the need for external knowledge or auxiliary models. To enhance sensitivity, we employ deep learnable kernels that automatically adapt to capture nuanced geometric differences between distributions. Our approach outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. The method remains competitive even without kernel training, offering a robust, scalable solution for hallucination detection.

<title>The Emergence of Abstract Thought in Large Language Models Beyond Any Language</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09890</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.09890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, their capacity to function effectively across a diverse range of languages has shown marked improvement. Preliminary studies observe that the hidden activations of LLMs often resemble English, even when responding to non-English prompts. This has led to the widespread assumption that LLMs may "think" in English. However, more recent results showing strong multilingual performance, even surpassing English performance on specific tasks in other languages, challenge this view. In this work, we find that LLMs progressively develop a core language-agnostic parameter space-a remarkably small subset of parameters whose deactivation results in significant performance degradation across all languages. This compact yet critical set of parameters underlies the model's ability to generalize beyond individual languages, supporting the emergence of abstract thought that is not tied to any specific linguistic system. Specifically, we identify language-related neurons-those are consistently activated during the processing of particular languages, and categorize them as either shared (active across multiple languages) or exclusive (specific to one). As LLMs undergo continued development over time, we observe a marked increase in both the proportion and functional importance of shared neurons, while exclusive neurons progressively diminish in influence. These shared neurons constitute the backbone of the core language-agnostic parameter space, supporting the emergence of abstract thought. Motivated by these insights, we propose neuron-specific training strategies tailored to LLMs' language-agnostic levels at different development stages. Experiments across diverse LLM families support our approach.

Abstract: Traditional models of climate change use complex systems of coupled equations to simulate physical processes across the Earth system. These simulations are highly computationally expensive, limiting our predictions of climate change and analyses of its causes and effects. Machine learning has the potential to quickly emulate data from climate models, but current approaches are not able to incorporate physics-informed causal relationships. Here, we develop an interpretable climate model emulator based on causal representation learning. We derive a physics-informed approach including a Bayesian filter for stable long-term autoregressive emulation. We demonstrate that our emulator learns accurate climate dynamics, and we show the importance of each one of its components on a realistic synthetic dataset and data from two widely deployed climate models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced conversational AI assistants. However, systematically evaluating how well these assistants apply personalization--adapting to individual user preferences while completing tasks--remains challenging. Existing personalization benchmarks focus on chit-chat, non-conversational tasks, or narrow domains, failing to capture the complexities of personalized task-oriented assistance. To address this, we introduce PersonaLens, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating personalization in task-oriented AI assistants. Our benchmark features diverse user profiles equipped with rich preferences and interaction histories, along with two specialized LLM-based agents: a user agent that engages in realistic task-oriented dialogues with AI assistants, and a judge agent that employs the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to assess personalization, response quality, and task success. Through extensive experiments with current LLM assistants across diverse tasks, we reveal significant variability in their personalization capabilities, providing crucial insights for advancing conversational AI systems.

Abstract: Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: While vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown promising robotic behaviors across a diverse set of manipulation tasks, they achieve limited success rates when deployed on novel tasks out-of-the-box. To allow these policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks, while VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on both successful and failed rollouts, and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\pi_0$, and $\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction. More qualitative results can be found at https://vla-safe.github.io/.

Abstract: Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems, especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards. These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d. actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a key technique for enhancing large language models (LLMs), with verification engineering playing a central role. However, best practices for RL in instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset, VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving significant improvements across several representative instruction-following benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.

Abstract: We introduce CausalVQA, a benchmark dataset for video question answering (VQA) composed of question-answer pairs that probe models' understanding of causality in the physical world. Existing VQA benchmarks either tend to focus on surface perceptual understanding of real-world videos, or on narrow physical reasoning questions created using simulation environments. CausalVQA fills an important gap by presenting challenging questions that are grounded in real-world scenarios, while focusing on models' ability to predict the likely outcomes of different actions and events through five question types: counterfactual, hypothetical, anticipation, planning and descriptive. We designed quality control mechanisms that prevent models from exploiting trivial shortcuts, requiring models to base their answers on deep visual understanding instead of linguistic cues. We find that current frontier multimodal models fall substantially below human performance on the benchmark, especially on anticipation and hypothetical questions. This highlights a challenge for current systems to leverage spatial-temporal reasoning, understanding of physical principles, and comprehension of possible alternatives to make accurate predictions in real-world settings.

Abstract: The scale diversity of point cloud data presents significant challenges in developing unified representation learning techniques for 3D vision. Currently, there are few unified 3D models, and no existing pre-training method is equally effective for both object- and scene-level point clouds. In this paper, we introduce UniPre3D, the first unified pre-training method that can be seamlessly applied to point clouds of any scale and 3D models of any architecture. Our approach predicts Gaussian primitives as the pre-training task and employs differentiable Gaussian splatting to render images, enabling precise pixel-level supervision and end-to-end optimization. To further regulate the complexity of the pre-training task and direct the model's focus toward geometric structures, we integrate 2D features from pre-trained image models to incorporate well-established texture knowledge. We validate the universal effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments across a variety of object- and scene-level tasks, using diverse point cloud models as backbones. Code is available at https://github.com/wangzy22/UniPre3D.

Abstract: In outside knowledge visual question answering (OK-VQA), the model must identify relevant visual information within an image and incorporate external knowledge to accurately respond to a question. Extending this task to a visually grounded dialogue setting based on videos, a conversational model must both recognize pertinent visual details over time and answer questions where the required information is not necessarily present in the visual information. Moreover, the context of the overall conversation must be considered for the subsequent dialogue. To explore this task, we introduce a dataset comprised of $2,017$ videos with $5,986$ human-annotated dialogues consisting of $40,954$ interleaved dialogue turns. While the dialogue context is visually grounded in specific video segments, the questions further require external knowledge that is not visually present. Thus, the model not only has to identify relevant video parts but also leverage external knowledge to converse within the dialogue. We further provide several baselines evaluated on our dataset and show future challenges associated with this task. The dataset is made publicly available here: https://github.com/c-patsch/OKCV.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed the great success of the generalist model in natural language processing. The generalist model is a general framework trained with massive data and is able to process various downstream tasks simultaneously. Encouraged by their impressive performance, an increasing number of researchers are venturing into the realm of applying these models to computer vision tasks. However, the inputs and outputs of vision tasks are more diverse, and it is difficult to summarize them as a unified representation. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the vision generalist models, delving into their characteristics and capabilities within the field. First, we review the background, including the datasets, tasks, and benchmarks. Then, we dig into the design of frameworks that have been proposed in existing research, while also introducing the techniques employed to enhance their performance. To better help the researchers comprehend the area, we take a brief excursion into related domains, shedding light on their interconnections and potential synergies. To conclude, we provide some real-world application scenarios, undertake a thorough examination of the persistent challenges, and offer insights into possible directions for future research endeavors.

Abstract: Indirect Prompt Injection attacks exploit the inherent limitation of Large Language Models (LLMs) to distinguish between instructions and data in their inputs. Despite numerous defense proposals, the systematic evaluation against adaptive adversaries remains limited, even when successful attacks can have wide security and privacy implications, and many real-world LLM-based applications remain vulnerable. We present the results of LLMail-Inject, a public challenge simulating a realistic scenario in which participants adaptively attempted to inject malicious instructions into emails in order to trigger unauthorized tool calls in an LLM-based email assistant. The challenge spanned multiple defense strategies, LLM architectures, and retrieval configurations, resulting in a dataset of 208,095 unique attack submissions from 839 participants. We release the challenge code, the full dataset of submissions, and our analysis demonstrating how this data can provide new insights into the instruction-data separation problem. We hope this will serve as a foundation for future research towards practical structural solutions to prompt injection.

<title>Reinforcing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Interwoven Thinking and Visual Drawing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09965</link>

Abstract: As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.

<title>InterActHuman: Multi-Concept Human Animation with Layout-Aligned Audio Conditions</title>

Abstract: End-to-end human animation with rich multi-modal conditions, e.g., text, image and audio has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years. However, most existing methods could only animate a single subject and inject conditions in a global manner, ignoring scenarios that multiple concepts could appears in the same video with rich human-human interactions and human-object interactions. Such global assumption prevents precise and per-identity control of multiple concepts including humans and objects, therefore hinders applications. In this work, we discard the single-entity assumption and introduce a novel framework that enforces strong, region-specific binding of conditions from modalities to each identity's spatiotemporal footprint. Given reference images of multiple concepts, our method could automatically infer layout information by leveraging a mask predictor to match appearance cues between the denoised video and each reference appearance. Furthermore, we inject local audio condition into its corresponding region to ensure layout-aligned modality matching in a iterative manner. This design enables the high-quality generation of controllable multi-concept human-centric videos. Empirical results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our explicit layout control for multi-modal conditions compared to implicit counterparts and other existing methods.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing, fueled by recent advancements in generative AI, is becoming increasingly widespread. This trend highlights the need for a comprehensive framework to verify text-guided edits and assess their quality. To address this need, we introduce EditInspector, a novel benchmark for evaluation of text-guided image edits, based on human annotations collected using an extensive template for edit verification. We leverage EditInspector to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision and language models in assessing edits across various dimensions, including accuracy, artifact detection, visual quality, seamless integration with the image scene, adherence to common sense, and the ability to describe edit-induced changes. Our findings indicate that current models struggle to evaluate edits comprehensively and frequently hallucinate when describing the changes. To address these challenges, we propose two novel methods that outperform SoTA models in both artifact detection and difference caption generation.

Abstract: Image restoration aims to recover degraded images. However, existing diffusion-based restoration methods, despite great success in natural image restoration, often struggle to faithfully reconstruct textual regions in degraded images. Those methods frequently generate plausible but incorrect text-like patterns, a phenomenon we refer to as text-image hallucination. In this paper, we introduce Text-Aware Image Restoration (TAIR), a novel restoration task that requires the simultaneous recovery of visual contents and textual fidelity. To tackle this task, we present SA-Text, a large-scale benchmark of 100K high-quality scene images densely annotated with diverse and complex text instances. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task diffusion framework, called TeReDiff, that integrates internal features from diffusion models into a text-spotting module, enabling both components to benefit from joint training. This allows for the extraction of rich text representations, which are utilized as prompts in subsequent denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art restoration methods, achieving significant gains in text recognition accuracy.

Abstract: If human experience is any guide, operating effectively in unstructured environments -- like homes and offices -- requires robots to sense the forces during physical interaction. Yet, the lack of a versatile, accessible, and easily customizable tactile sensor has led to fragmented, sensor-specific solutions in robotic manipulation -- and in many cases, to force-unaware, sensorless approaches. With eFlesh, we bridge this gap by introducing a magnetic tactile sensor that is low-cost, easy to fabricate, and highly customizable. Building an eFlesh sensor requires only four components: a hobbyist 3D printer, off-the-shelf magnets (<$5), a CAD model of the desired shape, and a magnetometer circuit board. The sensor is constructed from tiled, parameterized microstructures, which allow for tuning the sensor's geometry and its mechanical response. We provide an open-source design tool that converts convex OBJ/STL files into 3D-printable STLs for fabrication. This modular design framework enables users to create application-specific sensors, and to adjust sensitivity depending on the task. Our sensor characterization experiments demonstrate the capabilities of eFlesh: contact localization RMSE of 0.5 mm, and force prediction RMSE of 0.27 N for normal force and 0.12 N for shear force. We also present a learned slip detection model that generalizes to unseen objects with 95% accuracy, and visuotactile control policies that improve manipulation performance by 40% over vision-only baselines -- achieving 91% average success rate for four precise tasks that require sub-mm accuracy for successful completion. All design files, code and the CAD-to-eFlesh STL conversion tool are open-sourced and available on https://e-flesh.com.

<title>DGS-LRM: Real-Time Deformable 3D Gaussian Reconstruction From Monocular Videos</title>

Abstract: We introduce the Deformable Gaussian Splats Large Reconstruction Model (DGS-LRM), the first feed-forward method predicting deformable 3D Gaussian splats from a monocular posed video of any dynamic scene. Feed-forward scene reconstruction has gained significant attention for its ability to rapidly create digital replicas of real-world environments. However, most existing models are limited to static scenes and fail to reconstruct the motion of moving objects. Developing a feed-forward model for dynamic scene reconstruction poses significant challenges, including the scarcity of training data and the need for appropriate 3D representations and training paradigms. To address these challenges, we introduce several key technical contributions: an enhanced large-scale synthetic dataset with ground-truth multi-view videos and dense 3D scene flow supervision; a per-pixel deformable 3D Gaussian representation that is easy to learn, supports high-quality dynamic view synthesis, and enables long-range 3D tracking; and a large transformer network that achieves real-time, generalizable dynamic scene reconstruction. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that DGS-LRM achieves dynamic scene reconstruction quality comparable to optimization-based methods, while significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art predictive dynamic reconstruction method on real-world examples. Its predicted physically grounded 3D deformation is accurate and can readily adapt for long-range 3D tracking tasks, achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art monocular video 3D tracking methods.

<title>Goal Kernel Planning: Linearly-Solvable Non-Markovian Policies for Logical Tasks with Goal-Conditioned Options</title>

Abstract: In the domain of hierarchical planning, compositionality, abstraction, and task transfer are crucial for designing algorithms that can efficiently solve a variety of problems with maximal representational reuse. Many real-world problems require non-Markovian policies to handle complex structured tasks with logical conditions, often leading to prohibitively large state representations; this requires efficient methods for breaking these problems down and reusing structure between tasks. To this end, we introduce a compositional framework called Linearly-Solvable Goal Kernel Dynamic Programming (LS-GKDP) to address the complexity of solving non-Markovian Boolean sub-goal tasks with ordering constraints. LS-GKDP combines the Linearly-Solvable Markov Decision Process (LMDP) formalism with the Options Framework of Reinforcement Learning. LMDPs can be efficiently solved as a principal eigenvector problem, and options are policies with termination conditions used as temporally extended actions; with LS-GKDP we expand LMDPs to control over options for logical tasks. This involves decomposing a high-dimensional problem down into a set of goal-condition options for each goal and constructing a goal kernel, which is an abstract transition kernel that jumps from an option's initial-states to its termination-states along with an update of the higher-level task-state. We show how an LMDP with a goal kernel enables the efficient optimization of meta-policies in a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the task grounding. Options can also be remapped to new problems within a super-exponential space of tasks without significant recomputation, and we identify cases where the solution is invariant to the task grounding, permitting zero-shot task transfer.

<title>Decomposition Strategies and Multi-shot ASP Solving for Job-shop Scheduling</title>

Abstract: The Job-shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) is a well-known and challenging combinatorial optimization problem in which tasks sharing a machine are to be arranged in a sequence such that encompassing jobs can be completed as early as possible. In this paper, we investigate problem decomposition into time windows whose operations can be successively scheduled and optimized by means of multi-shot Answer Set Programming (ASP) solving. From a computational perspective, decomposition aims to split highly complex scheduling tasks into better manageable subproblems with a balanced number of operations such that good-quality or even optimal partial solutions can be reliably found in a small fraction of runtime. We devise and investigate a variety of decomposition strategies in terms of the number and size of time windows as well as heuristics for choosing their operations. Moreover, we incorporate time window overlapping and compression techniques into the iterative scheduling process to counteract optimization limitations due to the restriction to window-wise partial schedules. Our experiments on different JSP benchmark sets show that successive optimization by multi-shot ASP solving leads to substantially better schedules within tight runtime limits than single-shot optimization on the full problem. In particular, we find that decomposing initial solutions obtained with proficient heuristic methods into time windows leads to improved solution quality.

Abstract: The new field of Explainable Planning (XAIP) has produced a variety of approaches to explain and describe the behavior of autonomous agents to human observers. Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.

Abstract: The need to explain decisions made by AI systems is driven by both recent regulation and user demand. The decisions are often explainable only post hoc. In counterfactual explanations, one may ask what constitutes the best counterfactual explanation. Clearly, multiple criteria must be taken into account, although "distance from the sample" is a key criterion. Recent methods that consider the plausibility of a counterfactual seem to sacrifice this original objective. Here, we present a system that provides high-likelihood explanations that are, at the same time, close and sparse. We show that the search for the most likely explanations satisfying many common desiderata for counterfactual explanations can be modeled using Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO). We use a Sum-Product Network (SPN) to estimate the likelihood of a counterfactual. To achieve that, we propose an MIO formulation of an SPN, which can be of independent interest. The source code with examples is available at https://github.com/Epanemu/LiCE.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable progress in medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA), achieving high accuracy on existing benchmarks. However, their reliability under robust evaluation is questionable. This study reveals that when subjected to simple probing evaluation, state-of-the-art models perform worse than random guessing on medical diagnosis questions. To address this critical evaluation problem, we introduce the Probing Evaluation for Medical Diagnosis (ProbMed) dataset to rigorously assess LMM performance in medical imaging through probing evaluation and procedural diagnosis. Particularly, probing evaluation features pairing original questions with negation questions with hallucinated attributes, while procedural diagnosis requires reasoning across various diagnostic dimensions for each image, including modality recognition, organ identification, clinical findings, abnormalities, and positional grounding. Our evaluation reveals that top-performing models like GPT-4o, GPT-4V, and Gemini Pro perform worse than random guessing on specialized diagnostic questions, indicating significant limitations in handling fine-grained medical inquiries. Besides, models like LLaVA-Med struggle even with more general questions, and results from CheXagent demonstrate the transferability of expertise across different modalities of the same organ, showing that specialized domain knowledge is still crucial for improving performance. This study underscores the urgent need for more robust evaluation to ensure the reliability of LMMs in critical fields like medical diagnosis, and current LMMs are still far from applicable to those fields.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLM-driven MultiTask Evolutionary Algorithm (LLM2TEA), the first agentic AI designer within a generative evolutionary multitasking (GEM) framework that promotes the crossover and synergy of designs from multiple domains, leading to innovative solutions that transcend individual disciplines. Of particular interest is the discovery of objects that are not only innovative but also conform to the physical specifications of the real world in science and engineering. LLM2TEA comprises a large language model to initialize a population of genotypes (defined by text prompts) describing the objects of interest, a text-to-3D generative model to produce phenotypes from these prompts, a classifier to interpret the semantic representations of the objects, and a physics simulation model to assess their physical properties. We propose several novel LLM-based multitask evolutionary operators to guide the search toward the discovery of high-performing practical objects. Experimental results in conceptual design optimization validate the effectiveness of LLM2TEA, revealing from 97\% to 174\% improvement in the diversity of innovative objects compared to the present text-to-3D generative model baseline. In addition, more than 73\% of the generated designs have better physical performance than the top 1\% percentile of the designs generated in the baseline. Moreover, LLM2TEA generates designs that are not only aesthetically creative but also functional in real-world applications. Several of these designs have been successfully 3D-printed, emphasizing the proposed approach's capacity to transform AI-generated outputs into tangible physical objects. The designs produced by LLM2TEA meets practical requirements while showcasing creative and innovative features, underscoring its potential applications in complex design optimization and discovery.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, concerns regarding their safety have become prominent. In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize codeswitching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand codeswitching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating codeswitching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs.

Our method enhances the approximation of the squared indefinite Hessian matrix inherent in these problems, significantly improving both stability and efficiency through iterative greedy updates. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of MGSR1-SP, demonstrating its linear-quadratic convergence rate. Numerical experiments conducted on AUC maximization and adversarial debiasing problems, compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, underscore our method's enhanced convergence rate. These results affirm the potential of MGSR1-SP to improve performance across a broad spectrum of machine learning applications where efficient and accurate Hessian approximations are crucial.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to root cause attribution of delivery risks within supply chains by integrating causal discovery with reinforcement learning. As supply chains become increasingly complex, traditional methods of root cause analysis struggle to capture the intricate interrelationships between various factors, often leading to spurious correlations and suboptimal decision-making. Our approach addresses these challenges by leveraging causal discovery to identify the true causal relationships between operational variables, and reinforcement learning to iteratively refine the causal graph. This method enables the accurate identification of key drivers of late deliveries, such as shipping mode and delivery status, and provides actionable insights for optimizing supply chain performance. We apply our approach to a real-world supply chain dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in uncovering the underlying causes of delivery delays and offering strategies for mitigating these risks. The findings have significant implications for improving operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability within supply chains.

Abstract: Multi-hop query answering over a Knowledge Graph (KG) involves traversing one or more hops from the start node to answer a query. Path-based and logic-based methods are state-of-the-art for multi-hop question answering. The former is used in link prediction tasks. The latter is for answering complex logical queries. The logical multi-hop querying technique embeds the KG and queries in the same embedding space. The existing work incorporates First Order Logic (FOL) operators, such as conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$), and negation ($\neg$), in queries. Though current models have most of the building blocks to execute the FOL queries, they cannot use the dense information of multi-modal entities in the case of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs). We propose RConE, an embedding method to capture the multi-modal information needed to answer a query. The model first shortlists candidate (multi-modal) entities containing the answer. It then finds the solution (sub-entities) within those entities. Several existing works tackle path-based question-answering in MMKGs. However, to our knowledge, we are the first to introduce logical constructs in querying MMKGs and to answer queries that involve sub-entities of multi-modal entities as the answer. Extensive evaluation of four publicly available MMKGs indicates that RConE outperforms the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: This article presents a method for verifying RDF triples using LLMs, with an emphasis on providing traceable arguments. Because the LLMs cannot currently reliably identify the origin of the information used to construct the response to the user prompt, our approach is to avoid using internal LLM factual knowledge altogether. Instead, verified RDF statements are compared to chunks of external documents retrieved through a web search or Wikipedia. To assess the possible application of this retrieval augmented generation (RAG) workflow on biosciences content, we evaluated 1,719 positive statements from the BioRED dataset and the same number of newly generated negative statements. The resulting precision is 88 %, and recall is 44 %. This indicates that the method requires human oversight. We also evaluated the method on the SNLI dataset, which allowed us to compare our approach with models specifically tuned for the natural language inference task. We demonstrate the method on Wikidata, where a SPARQL query is used to automatically retrieve statements needing verification. Overall, the results suggest that LLMs could be used for large-scale verification of statements in KGs, a task previously unfeasible due to human annotation costs.

Abstract: Modeling human preferences is crucial for aligning foundation models with human values. Traditional reward modeling methods, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) reward model, fall short in expressiveness, particularly in addressing intransitive preferences. In this paper, we introduce preference embedding, an approach that embeds responses into a latent space to capture intricate preference structures efficiently, achieving linear query complexity. Additionally, we propose preference score-based General Preference Optimization (GPO), which generalizes reward-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Experimental results show that our General Preference embedding Model (GPM) consistently outperforms the BT reward model on the RewardBench benchmark and effectively models cyclic preferences where any BT reward model behaves like a random guess. Furthermore, evaluations on downstream tasks such as AlpacaEval2.0, following the language model post-training with GPO and our general preference model, reveal performance improvements over BT models. These findings indicate that our method may enhance the alignment of foundation models with nuanced human values.

Abstract: The segmentation-free research efforts for addressing handwritten text recognition can be divided into three categories: connectionist temporal classification (CTC), hidden Markov model and encoder-decoder methods. In this paper, inspired by the above three modeling methods, we propose a new recognition network by using a novel three-dimensional (3D) attention module and global-local context information. Based on the feature maps of the last convolutional layer, a series of 3D blocks with different resolutions are split. Then, these 3D blocks are fed into the 3D attention module to generate sequential visual features. Finally, by integrating the visual features and the corresponding global-local context features, a well-designed representation can be obtained. Main canonical neural units including attention mechanisms, fully-connected layer, recurrent unit and convolutional layer are efficiently organized into a network and can be jointly trained by the CTC loss and the cross-entropy loss. Experiments on the latest Chinese handwritten text datasets (the SCUT-HCCDoc and the SCUT-EPT) and one English handwritten text dataset (the IAM) show that the proposed method can achieve comparable results with the state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/Wukong90/3DAttention-MultiScaleTraining-for-HTR.

Abstract: Embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as Voyager, promise open-ended competence in worlds such as Minecraft. However, when powered by open-weight LLMs they still falter on elementary tasks after domain-specific fine-tuning. We propose MindForge, a generative-agent framework for cultural lifelong learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts, beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural inter-agent communication; and (3) a multi-component memory system. Following the cultural learning framework, we test MindForge in both instructive and collaborative settings within Minecraft. In an instructive setting with GPT-4, MindForge agents powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts in basic tasks yielding $3\times$ more tech-tree milestones and collecting $2.3\times$ more unique items than the Voyager baseline. Furthermore, in fully \textit{collaborative} settings, we find that the performance of two underachieving agents improves with more communication rounds, echoing the Condorcet Jury Theorem. MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated cultural experiences.

Abstract: Understanding the internal computations of large language models (LLMs) is crucial for aligning them with human values and preventing undesirable behaviors like toxic content generation. However, mechanistic interpretability is hindered by polysemanticity -- where individual neurons respond to multiple, unrelated concepts. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have attempted to disentangle these features through sparse dictionary learning, they have compromised LLM performance due to reliance on post-hoc reconstruction loss. To address this issue, we introduce Mixture of Monosemantic Experts for Transformers (Monet) architecture, which incorporates sparse dictionary learning directly into end-to-end Mixture-of-Experts pretraining. Our novel expert decomposition method enables scaling the expert count to 262,144 per layer while total parameters scale proportionally to the square root of the number of experts. Our analyses demonstrate mutual exclusivity of knowledge across experts and showcase the parametric knowledge encapsulated within individual experts. Moreover, Monet allows knowledge manipulation over domains, languages, and toxicity mitigation without degrading general performance. Our pursuit of transparent LLMs highlights the potential of scaling expert counts to enhance mechanistic interpretability and directly resect the internal knowledge to fundamentally adjust model behavior. The source code and pretrained checkpoints are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/Monet.

<title>Logic-Constrained Shortest Paths for Flight Planning</title>

Abstract: The logic-constrained shortest path problem (LCSPP) combines a one-to-one shortest path problem with satisfiability constraints imposed on the routing graph. This setting arises in flight planning, where air traffic control (ATC) authorities are enforcing a set of traffic flow restrictions (TFRs) on aircraft routes in order to increase safety and throughput. We propose a new branch and bound-based algorithm for the LCSPP. The resulting algorithm has three main degrees of freedom: the node selection rule, the branching rule and the conflict. While node selection and branching rules have been long studied in the MIP and SAT communities, most of them cannot be applied out of the box for the LCSPP. We review the existing literature and develop tailored variants of the most prominent rules. The conflict, the set of variables to which the branching rule is applied, is unique to the LCSPP. We analyze its theoretical impact on the B&amp;B algorithm. In the second part of the paper, we show how to model the flight planning problem with TFRs as an LCSPP and solve it using the branch and bound algorithm. We demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency on a dataset consisting of a global flight graph and a set of around 20000 real TFRs obtained from our industry partner Lufthansa Systems GmbH. We make this dataset publicly available. Finally, we conduct an empirical in-depth analysis of dynamic shortest path algorithms, node selection rules, branching rules and conflicts. Carefully choosing an appropriate combination yields an improvement of an order of magnitude compared to an uninformed choice.

<title>Supervision policies can shape long-term risk management in general-purpose AI models</title>

Abstract: The rapid proliferation and deployment of General-Purpose AI (GPAI) models, including large language models (LLMs), present unprecedented challenges for AI supervisory entities. We hypothesize that these entities will need to navigate an emergent ecosystem of risk and incident reporting, likely to exceed their supervision capacity. To investigate this, we develop a simulation framework parameterized by features extracted from the diverse landscape of risk, incident, or hazard reporting ecosystems, including community-driven platforms, crowdsourcing initiatives, and expert assessments. We evaluate four supervision policies: non-prioritized (first-come, first-served), random selection, priority-based (addressing the highest-priority risks first), and diversity-prioritized (balancing high-priority risks with comprehensive coverage across risk types). Our results indicate that while priority-based and diversity-prioritized policies are more effective at mitigating high-impact risks, particularly those identified by experts, they may inadvertently neglect systemic issues reported by the broader community. This oversight can create feedback loops that amplify certain types of reporting while discouraging others, leading to a skewed perception of the overall risk landscape. We validate our simulation results with several real-world datasets, including one with over a million ChatGPT interactions, of which more than 150,000 conversations were identified as risky. This validation underscores the complex trade-offs inherent in AI risk supervision and highlights how the choice of risk management policies can shape the future landscape of AI risks across diverse GPAI models used in society.

Abstract: Reasoning language models (RLMs), also known as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o1 and o3, DeepSeek-R1, and Alibaba's QwQ, have redefined AI's problem-solving capabilities by extending LLMs with advanced reasoning mechanisms. Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining reinforcement learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM design and experimentation.

Abstract: Understanding human preferences is crucial for improving foundation models and building personalized AI systems. However, preferences are inherently diverse and complex, making it difficult for traditional reward models to capture their full range. While fine-grained preference data can help, collecting it is expensive and hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs), a novel approach that extracts diverse human preferences from binary comparisons without requiring fine-grained annotations. Our key insight is to represent human preferences as vectors and analyze them using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By constructing a dataset of embedding differences between preferred and rejected responses, DRMs identify orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference. These decomposed rewards can be flexibly combined to align with different user needs, offering an interpretable and scalable alternative to traditional reward models. We demonstrate that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference dimensions (e.g., helpfulness, safety, humor) and adapt to new users without additional training. Our results highlight DRMs as a powerful framework for personalized and interpretable LLM alignment. Our code is available at https://github.com/amandaluof/DRMs.

Abstract: With the development of distributed systems, microservices and cloud native technologies have become central to modern enterprise software development. Despite bringing significant advantages, these technologies also increase system complexity and operational challenges. Traditional root cause analysis (RCA) struggles to achieve automated fault response, heavily relying on manual intervention. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made breakthroughs in contextual inference and domain knowledge integration, providing new solutions for Artificial Intelligence for Operations (AIOps). However, Existing LLM-based approaches face three key challenges: text input constraints, dynamic service dependency hallucinations, and context window limitations. To address these issues, we propose a tool-assisted LLM agent with multi-modality observation data, namely TAMO, for fine-grained RCA. It unifies multi-modal observational data into time-aligned representations to extract consistent features and employs specialized root cause localization and fault classification tools for perceiving the contextual environment. This approach overcomes the limitations of LLM in handling real-time changing service dependencies and raw observational data and guides LLM to generate repair strategies aligned with system contexts by structuring key information into a prompt. Experimental results show that TAMO performs well in root cause analysis when dealing with public datasets characterized by heterogeneity and common fault types, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a core component of human cognition, enabling individuals to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. It relies on a nuanced understanding of spatial structures and inter-object relationships, serving as the foundation for complex reasoning and decision-making. To investigate whether current vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit similar capability, we introduce Jigsaw-Puzzles, a novel benchmark consisting of 1,100 carefully curated real-world images with high spatial complexity. Based on this dataset, we design five tasks to rigorously evaluate VLMs' spatial perception, structural understanding, and reasoning capabilities, while deliberately minimizing reliance on domain-specific knowledge to better isolate and assess the general spatial reasoning capability. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 24 state-of-the-art VLMs. The results show that even the strongest model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves only 77.14% overall accuracy and performs particularly poorly on the Order Generation task, with only 30.00% accuracy, far below the performance exceeding 90% achieved by human participants. This persistent gap underscores the need for continued progress, positioning Jigsaw-Puzzles as a challenging and diagnostic benchmark for advancing spatial reasoning research in VLMs. Our project page is at https://zesen01.github.io/jigsaw-puzzles

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise for automating real-world tasks but struggle to transfer across domains due to their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks. Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next generation of general-purpose AI assistants.

Abstract: We study Boolean classification problems over relational background structures in the logical framework introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004). It is known (Grohe and Ritzert, LICS 2017) that classifiers definable in first-order logic over structures of polylogarithmic degree can be learned in sublinear time, where the degree of the structure and the running time are measured in terms of the size of the structure. We generalise the results to the first-order logic with counting FOCN, which was introduced by Kuske and Schweikardt (LICS 2017) as an expressive logic generalising various other counting logics. Specifically, we prove that classifiers definable in FOCN over classes of structures of polylogarithmic degree can be consistently learned in sublinear time. This can be seen as a first step towards extending the learning framework to include numerical aspects of machine learning. We extend the result to agnostic probably approximately correct (PAC) learning for classes of structures of degree at most $(\log \log n)^c$ for some constant $c$. Moreover, we show that bounding the degree is crucial to obtain sublinear-time learning algorithms. That is, we prove that, for structures of unbounded degree, learning is not possible in sublinear time, even for classifiers definable in plain first-order logic.

Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.

Abstract: Modeling spatial-temporal interactions among neighboring agents is at the heart of multi-agent problems such as motion forecasting and crowd navigation. Despite notable progress, it remains unclear to which extent modern representations can capture the causal relationships behind agent interactions. In this work, we take an in-depth look at the causal awareness of these representations, from computational formalism to real-world practice. First, we cast doubt on the notion of non-causal robustness studied in the recent CausalAgents benchmark. We show that recent representations are already partially resilient to perturbations of non-causal agents, and yet modeling indirect causal effects involving mediator agents remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a metric learning approach that regularizes latent representations with causal annotations. Our controlled experiments show that this approach not only leads to higher degrees of causal awareness but also yields stronger out-of-distribution robustness. To further operationalize it in practice, we propose a sim-to-real causal transfer method via cross-domain multi-task learning. Experiments on pedestrian datasets show that our method can substantially boost generalization, even in the absence of real-world causal annotations. We hope our work provides a new perspective on the challenges and pathways towards causally-aware representations of multi-agent interactions.

Abstract: In this paper, we further explore the potential of analog in-memory computing (AiMC) and introduce an innovative artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator architecture named YOCO, featuring three key proposals: (1) YOCO proposes a novel 8-bit in-situ multiply arithmetic (IMA) achieving 123.8 TOPS/W energy-efficiency and 34.9 TOPS throughput through efficient charge-domain computation and timedomain accumulation mechanism. (2) YOCO employs a hybrid ReRAM-SRAM memory structure to balance computational efficiency and storage density. (3) YOCO tailors an IMC-friendly attention computing flow with an efficient pipeline to accelerate the inference of transformer-based AI models. Compared to three SOTA baselines, YOCO on average improves energy efficiency by up to 3.9x-19.9x and throughput by up to 6.8x-33.6x across 10 CNN/transformer models.

Abstract: Iterative voting is a natural model of repeated strategic decision-making in social choice theory when agents have the opportunity to update their votes prior to finalizing the group decision. Prior work has analyzed the efficacy of iterative plurality on the welfare of the chosen outcome at equilibrium, relative to the truthful vote profile, via an adaptation of the price of anarchy. However, prior analyses have only studied the worst- and average-case performances when agents' preferences are distributed by the impartial culture. This work extends average-case analysis comprehensively across three alternatives and distinguishes under which of agents' preference distributions iterative plurality improves or degrades asymptotic welfare.

Abstract: The exponential growth in scientific publications poses a severe challenge for human researchers. It forces attention to more narrow sub-fields, which makes it challenging to discover new impactful research ideas and collaborations outside one's own field. While there are ways to predict a scientific paper's future citation counts, they need the research to be finished and the paper written, usually assessing impact long after the idea was conceived. Here we show how to predict the impact of onsets of ideas that have never been published by researchers. For that, we developed a large evolving knowledge graph built from more than 21 million scientific papers. It combines a semantic network created from the content of the papers and an impact network created from the historic citations of papers. Using machine learning, we can predict the dynamic of the evolving network into the future with high accuracy (AUC values beyond 0.9 for most experiments), and thereby the impact of new research directions. We envision that the ability to predict the impact of new ideas will be a crucial component of future artificial muses that can inspire new impactful and interesting scientific ideas.

Abstract: This study aims to enhance BCI applications for individuals with motor impairments by comparing the effectiveness of tripolar EEG (tEEG) with conventional EEG. The focus is on interpreting and decoding various grasping movements, such as power grasp and precision grasp. The goal is to determine which EEG technology is more effective in processing and translating grasp related neural signals. The approach involved experimenting on ten healthy participants who performed two distinct grasp movements: power grasp and precision grasp, with a no movement condition serving as the baseline. Our research presents a thorough comparison between EEG and tEEG in decoding grasping movements. This comparison spans several key parameters, including signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution via functional connectivity, ERPs, and wavelet time frequency analysis. Additionally, our study involved extracting and analyzing statistical features from the wavelet coefficients, and both binary and multiclass classification methods were employed. Four machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the decoding accuracies. Our results indicated that tEEG demonstrated superior performance over conventional EEG in various aspects. This included a higher signal to noise ratio, enhanced spatial resolution, and more informative data in ERPs and wavelet time frequency analysis. The use of tEEG led to notable improvements in decoding accuracy for differentiating movement types. Specifically, tEEG achieved around 90% accuracy in binary and 75.97% for multiclass classification. These results are markedly better than those from standard EEG, which recorded a maximum of 77.85% and 61.27% in similar tasks, respectively. These findings highlight the superior effectiveness of tEEG over EEG in decoding grasp types and its competitive or superior performance in complex classifications compared with existing research.

Abstract: Automated essay scoring (AES) is a useful tool in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing education, offering real-time essay scores for students and instructors. However, previous AES models were trained on essays and scores irrelevant to the practical scenarios of EFL writing education and usually provided a single holistic score due to the lack of appropriate datasets. In this paper, we release DREsS, a large-scale, standard dataset for rubric-based automated essay scoring with 48.9K samples in total. DREsS comprises three sub-datasets: DREsS_New, DREsS_Std., and DREsS_CASE. We collect DREsS_New, a real-classroom dataset with 2.3K essays authored by EFL undergraduate students and scored by English education experts. We also standardize existing rubric-based essay scoring datasets as DREsS_Std. We suggest CASE, a corruption-based augmentation strategy for essays, which generates 40.1K synthetic samples of DREsS_CASE and improves the baseline results by 45.44%. DREsS will enable further research to provide a more accurate and practical AES system for EFL writing education.

Abstract: Language is an intricately structured system, and a key goal of NLP interpretability is to provide methodological insights for understanding how language models represent this structure internally. In this paper, we use Shapley Taylor interaction indices (STII) in order to examine how language and speech models internally relate and structure their inputs. Pairwise Shapley interactions measure how much two inputs work together to influence model outputs beyond if we linearly added their independent influences, providing a view into how models encode structural interactions between inputs. We relate the interaction patterns in models to three underlying linguistic structures: syntactic structure, non-compositional semantics, and phonetic coarticulation. We find that autoregressive text models encode interactions that correlate with the syntactic proximity of inputs, and that both autoregressive and masked models encode nonlinear interactions in idiomatic phrases with non-compositional semantics. Our speech results show that inputs are more entangled for pairs where a neighboring consonant is likely to influence a vowel or approximant, showing that models encode the phonetic interaction needed for extracting discrete phonemic representations.

arXiv:2405.14259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose "Generative Fusion Decoding" (GFD), a novel shallow fusion framework designed to integrate large language models (LLMs) into cross-modal text recognition systems for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and optical character recognition (OCR). We derive the necessary formulations to enable GFD to operate across mismatched token spaces of different models by calculating likelihood at the byte level, thereby enabling seamless fusion and synchronous progression during the decoding process. GFD is plug-and-play by design, making it readily compatible with various auto-regressive models without the need for any re-training. GFD proves effective for general ASR and OCR tasks through intermediate and frequent interactions with LLMs, surpassing cascaded methods in English and Mandarin benchmarks. In addition, GFD transfers in-context learning abilities of LLMs and allows for adaptive ASR in instruction-aware and long-context settings, yielding significant WER reductions of up to 17.7\%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may exhibit unintended or undesirable behaviors. Recent works have concentrated on aligning LLMs to mitigate harmful outputs. Despite these efforts, some anomalies indicate that even a well-conducted alignment process can be easily circumvented, whether intentionally or accidentally. Does alignment fine-tuning yield have robust effects on models, or are its impacts merely superficial? In this work, we make the first exploration of this phenomenon from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Empirically, we demonstrate the $\mathbf{elasticity}$ of post-alignment models, i.e., the tendency to revert to the behavior distribution formed during the pre-training phase upon further fine-tuning. Leveraging compression theory, we formally deduce that fine-tuning disproportionately undermines alignment relative to pre-training, potentially by orders of magnitude. We validate the presence of elasticity through experiments on models of varying types and scales. Specifically, we find that model performance declines rapidly before reverting to the pre-training distribution, after which the rate of decline drops significantly. Furthermore, we further reveal that elasticity positively correlates with the increased model size and the expansion of pre-training data. Our findings underscore the need to address the inherent elasticity of LLMs to mitigate their resistance to alignment. The model weight and code are available at pku-lm-resist-alignment.github.io.

Abstract: Warning: Contains harmful model outputs. Despite significant advancements, the propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful and unethical content poses critical challenges. Measuring value alignment of LLMs becomes crucial for their regulation and responsible deployment. Although numerous benchmarks have been constructed to assess social bias, toxicity, and ethical issues in LLMs, those static benchmarks suffer from evaluation chronoeffect, in which, as models rapidly evolve, existing benchmarks may leak into training data or become saturated, overestimating ever-developing LLMs. To tackle this problem, we propose GETA, a novel generative evolving testing approach based on adaptive testing methods in measurement theory. Unlike traditional adaptive testing methods that rely on a static test item pool, GETA probes the underlying moral boundaries of LLMs by dynamically generating test items tailored to model capability. GETA co-evolves with LLMs by learning a joint distribution of item difficulty and model value conformity, thus effectively addressing evaluation chronoeffect. We evaluated various popular LLMs with GETA and demonstrated that 1) GETA can dynamically create difficulty-tailored test items and 2) GETA's evaluation results are more consistent with models' performance on unseen OOD and i.i.d. items, laying the groundwork for future evaluation paradigms.

<title>CaLMQA: Exploring culturally specific long-form question answering across 23 languages</title>

Abstract: Despite rising global usage of large language models (LLMs), their ability to generate long-form answers to culturally specific questions remains unexplored in many languages. To fill this gap, we perform the first study of textual multilingual long-form QA by creating CaLMQA, a dataset of 51.7K culturally specific questions across 23 different languages. We define culturally specific questions as those that refer to concepts unique to one or a few cultures, or have different answers depending on the cultural or regional context. We obtain these questions by crawling naturally-occurring questions from community web forums in high-resource languages, and by hiring native speakers to write questions in under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our data collection methodologies are translation-free, enabling the collection of culturally unique questions like "Kuber iki umwami wa mbere w'uburundi yitwa Ntare?" (Kirundi; English translation: "Why was the first king of Burundi called Ntare (Lion)?"). We evaluate factuality, relevance and surface-level quality of LLM-generated long-form answers, finding that (1) for many languages, even the best models make critical surface-level errors (e.g., answering in the wrong language, repetition), especially for low-resource languages; and (2) answers to culturally specific questions contain more factual errors than answers to culturally agnostic questions -- questions that have consistent meaning and answer across many cultures. We release CaLMQA to facilitate future research in cultural and multilingual long-form QA.

<title>BiCo-Fusion: Bidirectional Complementary LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Semantic- and Spatial-Aware 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: 3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts. Project page: https://t-ys.github.io/BiCo-Fusion/.

<title>The Remarkable Robustness of LLMs: Stages of Inference?</title>

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to structural interventions by deleting and swapping adjacent layers during inference. Surprisingly, models retain 72-95% of their original top-1 prediction accuracy without any fine-tuning. We find that performance degradation is not uniform across layers: interventions to the early and final layers cause the most degradation, while the model is remarkably robust to dropping middle layers. This pattern of localized sensitivity motivates our hypothesis of four stages of inference, observed across diverse model families and sizes: (1) detokenization, where local context is integrated to lift raw token embeddings into higher-level representations; (2) feature engineering, where task- and entity-specific features are iteratively refined; (3) prediction ensembling, where hidden states are aggregated into plausible next-token predictions; and (4) residual sharpening, where irrelevant features are suppressed to finalize the output distribution. Synthesizing behavioral and mechanistic evidence, we provide a framework for interpreting depth-dependent computations in LLMs.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) represent a groundbreaking shift in machine learning approaches to computer vision. Unlike traditional approaches, ViTs employ the self-attention mechanism, which has been widely used in natural language processing, to analyze image patches. Despite their advantages in modeling visual tasks, deploying ViTs on hardware platforms, notably Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), introduces considerable challenges. These challenges stem primarily from the non-linear calculations and high computational and memory demands of ViTs. This paper introduces CHOSEN, a software-hardware co-design framework to address these challenges and offer an automated framework for ViT deployment on the FPGAs in order to maximize performance. Our framework is built upon three fundamental contributions: multi-kernel design to maximize the bandwidth, mainly targeting benefits of multi DDR memory banks, approximate non-linear functions that exhibit minimal accuracy degradation, and efficient use of available logic blocks on the FPGA, and efficient compiler to maximize the performance and memory-efficiency of the computing kernels by presenting a novel algorithm for design space exploration to find optimal hardware configuration that achieves optimal throughput and latency. Compared to the state-of-the-art ViT accelerators, CHOSEN achieves a 1.5x and 1.42x improvement in the throughput on the DeiT-S and DeiT-B models.

Abstract: Humor, deeply rooted in societal meanings and cultural details, poses a unique challenge for machines. While advances have been made in natural language processing, real-world humor often thrives in a multi-modal context, encapsulated distinctively by memes. This paper poses a particular emphasis on the impact of multi-images on meme captioning. After that, we introduce the \textsc{XMeCap} framework, a novel approach that adopts supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning based on an innovative reward model, which factors in both global and local similarities between visuals and text. Our results, benchmarked against contemporary models, manifest a marked improvement in caption generation for both single-image and multi-image memes, as well as different meme categories. \textsc{XMeCap} achieves an average evaluation score of 75.85 for single-image memes and 66.32 for multi-image memes, outperforming the best baseline by 6.75\% and 8.56\%, respectively. This research not only establishes a new frontier in meme-related studies but also underscores the potential of machines in understanding and generating humor in a multi-modal setting.

Abstract: Performance evaluation plays a crucial role in the development life cycle of large language models (LLMs). It estimates the model's capability, elucidates behavior characteristics, and facilitates the identification of potential issues and limitations, thereby guiding further improvement. Given that LLMs' diverse task-handling abilities stem from large volumes of training data, a comprehensive evaluation also necessitates abundant, well-annotated, and representative test data to assess LLM performance across various downstream tasks. However, the demand for high-quality test data often entails substantial time, computational resources, and manual efforts, sometimes causing the evaluation to be inefficient or impractical. To address these challenges, researchers propose active testing, which estimates the overall performance by selecting a subset of test data. Nevertheless, the existing active testing methods tend to be inefficient, even inapplicable, given the unique new challenges of LLMs (e.g., diverse task types, increased model complexity, and unavailability of training data). To mitigate such limitations and expedite the development cycle of LLMs, in this work, we introduce AcTracer, an active testing framework tailored for LLMs that strategically selects a small subset of test data to achieve a more accurate performance estimation for LLMs. AcTracer utilizes both internal and external information from LLMs to guide the test sampling process, reducing variance through a multi-stage pool-based active selection. Our experiment results demonstrate that AcTracer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods across various tasks.

Abstract: Accurate uncertainty estimation is a critical challenge in open-set recognition, where a probe biometric sample may belong to an unknown identity. It can be addressed through sample quality estimation via probabilistic embeddings. However, the low variance of probabilistic embedding only partly implies a low identification error probability: an embedding of a sample could be close to several classes in a gallery, thus yielding high uncertainty despite high sample quality. We propose HolUE - a holistic uncertainty estimation method based on a Bayesian probabilistic model; it is aware of two sources of ambiguity in the open-set recognition system: (1) the gallery uncertainty caused by overlapping classes and (2) the uncertainty of embeddings. Challenging open-set recognition datasets, such as IJB-C for the image domain and VoxBlink for the audio domain, serve as a testbed for our method. We also provide a new open-set recognition protocol for the identification of whales and dolphins. In all cases, HolUE better identifies recognition errors than alternative uncertainty estimation methods, including those based solely on sample quality.

Abstract: In machine learning, contamination refers to situations where testing data leak into the training set. The issue is particularly relevant for the evaluation of the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), which are generally trained on gargantuan, and generally opaque, corpora of text scraped from the world wide web. Developing tools to detect contamination is therefore crucial to be able to fairly and properly track the evolution of the performance of LLMs. To date, only a few recent studies have attempted to address the issue of quantifying and detecting contamination in short text sequences, such as those commonly found in benchmarks. However, these methods have limitations that can sometimes render them impractical.In the present paper, we introduce LogProber, a novel, efficient algorithm that we show to be able to detect contamination in a black box setting that tries to tackle some of these drawbacks by focusing on the familiarity with the question rather than the answer. Here, we explore the properties of the proposed method in comparison with concurrent approaches, identify its advantages and limitations, and illustrate how different forms of contamination can go undetected depending on the design of the detection algorithm.

Abstract: Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs), such as term lists, thesauri, taxonomies, and ontologies, play a fundamental role in categorising, managing, and retrieving information. In the academic domain, KOSs are often adopted for representing research areas and their relationships, primarily aiming to classify research articles, academic courses, patents, books, scientific venues, domain experts, grants, software, experiment materials, and several other relevant products and agents. These structured representations of research areas, widely embraced by many academic fields, have proven effective in empowering AI-based systems to i) enhance retrievability of relevant documents, ii) enable advanced analytic solutions to quantify the impact of academic research, and iii) analyse and forecast research dynamics. This paper aims to present a comprehensive survey of the current KOS for academic disciplines. We analysed and compared 45 KOSs according to five main dimensions: scope, structure, curation, usage, and links to other KOSs. Our results reveal a very heterogeneous scenario in terms of scope, scale, quality, and usage, highlighting the need for more integrated solutions for representing research knowledge across academic fields. We conclude by discussing the main challenges and the most promising future directions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant challenges in detecting and repairing vulnerable code, particularly when dealing with vulnerabilities involving multiple aspects, such as variables, code flows, and code structures. In this study, we utilize GitHub Copilot as the LLM and focus on buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Our experiments reveal a notable gap in Copilot's abilities when dealing with buffer overflow vulnerabilities, with a 76% vulnerability detection rate but only a 15% vulnerability repair rate. To address this issue, we propose context-aware prompt tuning techniques designed to enhance LLM performance in repairing buffer overflow. By injecting a sequence of domain knowledge about the vulnerability, including various security and code contexts, we demonstrate that Copilot's successful repair rate increases to 63%, representing more than four times the improvement compared to repairs without domain knowledge.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable advancements in terms of image quality and fidelity to textual prompts. Concurrently, the safety of such generative models has become an area of growing concern. This work introduces a novel type of jailbreak, which triggers T2I models to generate the image with visual text, where the image and the text, although considered to be safe in isolation, combine to form unsafe content. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we propose a dataset to evaluate the current diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models under such jailbreak. We benchmark nine representative T2I models, including two closed-source commercial models. Experimental results reveal a concerning tendency to produce unsafe content: all tested models suffer from such type of jailbreak, with rates of unsafe generation ranging from around 10\% to 70\% where DALLE 3 demonstrates almost the highest unsafety. In real-world scenarios, various filters such as keyword blocklists, customized prompt filters, and NSFW image filters, are commonly employed to mitigate these risks. We evaluate the effectiveness of such filters against our jailbreak and found that, while these filters may be effective for single modality detection, they fail to work against our jailbreak. We also investigate the underlying reason for such jailbreaks, from the perspective of text rendering capability and training data. Our work provides a foundation for further development towards more secure and reliable T2I models. Project page at https://multimodalpragmatic.github.io/.

<title>CTPD: Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery for Enhanced Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis</title>

Abstract: Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now exhibit near human-level performance in various tasks, but their performance drops drastically after a handful of high-resource languages due to the imbalance in pre-training data. Inspired by the human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching$\unicode{x2014}$the practice of language alternation in a conversation$\unicode{x2014}$we propose code-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for LLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively training models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching, 2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as our underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving language transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared to monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that both token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance cross-lingual transfer and that curriculum learning amplifies these effects. We also extend our findings into various languages, including Japanese (high-resource) and Indonesian (low-resource), and using two additional models (Gemma 2 and Phi 3.5). We further show that CSCL mitigates spurious correlations between language resources and safety alignment, presenting a robust, efficient framework for more equitable language transfer in LLMs. We observe that CSCL is effective for low-resource settings where high-quality, monolingual corpora for language transfer are hardly available.

<title>GenJoin: Conditional Generative Plan-to-Plan Query Optimizer that Learns from Subplan Hints</title>

Abstract: Query optimization has become a research area where classical algorithms are being challenged by machine learning algorithms. At the same time, recent trends in learned query optimizers have shown that it is prudent to take advantage of decades of database research and augment classical query optimizers by shrinking the plan search space through different types of hints (e.g. by specifying the join type, scan type or the order of joins) rather than completely replacing the classical query optimizer with machine learning models. It is especially relevant for cases when classical optimizers cannot fully enumerate all logical and physical plans and, as an alternative, need to rely on less robust approaches like genetic algorithms. However, even symbiotically learned query optimizers are hampered by the need for vast amounts of training data, slow plan generation during inference and unstable results across various workload conditions. In this paper, we present GenJoin - a novel learned query optimizer that considers the query optimization problem as a generative task and is capable of learning from a random set of subplan hints to produce query plans that outperform the classical optimizer. GenJoin is the first learned query optimizer that significantly and consistently outperforms PostgreSQL as well as state-of-the-art methods on two well-known real-world benchmarks across a variety of workloads using rigorous machine learning evaluations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to backdoor attacks that manipulate outputs via hidden triggers. Existing defense methods--designed for vision/text classification tasks--fail for text generation. We propose Internal Consistency Regularization (CROW), a defense leveraging the observation that backdoored models exhibit unstable layer-wise hidden representations when triggered, while clean models show smooth transitions. CROW enforces consistency across layers via adversarial perturbations and regularization during finetuning, neutralizing backdoors without requiring clean reference models or trigger knowledge--only a small clean dataset. Experiments across Llama-2 (7B, 13B), CodeLlama (7B, 13B), and Mistral-7B demonstrate CROW's effectiveness: it achieves significant reductions in attack success rates across diverse backdoor strategies (sentiment steering, targeted refusal, code injection) while preserving generative performance. CROW's architecture-agnostic design enables practical deployment.

<title>Meaningless is better: hashing bias-inducing words in LLM prompts improves performance in logical reasoning and statistical learning</title>

arXiv:2411.17304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method, referred to as "hashing", which involves masking potentially bias-inducing words in large language models (LLMs) with hash-like meaningless identifiers to reduce cognitive biases and reliance on external knowledge. The method was tested across three sets of experiments involving a total of 490 prompts. Statistical analysis using chi-square tests showed significant improvements in all tested scenarios, which covered LLama, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini and Mixtral models. In the first experiment, hashing decreased the fallacy rate in a modified version of the "Linda" problem aimed at evaluating susceptibility to cognitive biases. In the second experiment, it improved LLM results on the frequent itemset extraction task. In the third experiment, we found hashing is also effective when the Linda problem is presented in a tabular format rather than text, indicating that the technique works across various input representations. Overall, the method was shown to improve bias reduction and incorporation of external knowledge. Despite bias reduction, hallucination rates were inconsistently reduced across types of LLM models. These findings suggest that masking bias-inducing terms can improve LLM performance, although its effectiveness is model- and task-dependent.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) are usually fine-tuned to participate in dyadic or two-party dialogues, which can not adapt well to multi-party dialogues (MPD), which hinders their applications in such scenarios including multi-personal meetings, discussions and daily communication. Previous LLM-based researches mainly focus on the multi-agent framework, while their base LLMs are still pairwisely fine-tuned. In this work, we design a multi-party fine-tuning framework (MuPaS) for LLMs on the multi-party dialogue datasets, and prove such a straightforward framework can let the LLM align with the multi-party conversation style efficiently and effectively. We also design two training strategies which can convert MuPaS into the MPD simulator. Substantial experiments show that MuPaS can achieve state-of-the-art multi-party response, higher accuracy of the-next-speaker prediction, higher human and automatic evaluated utterance qualities, and can even generate reasonably with out-of-distribution scene, topic and role descriptions. The MuPaS framework bridges the LLM training with more complicated multi-party applications, such as conversation generation, virtual rehearsal or meta-universe.

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone a significant transformation, marked by a rapid rise in both their popularity and capabilities. Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) following DeepSeek R1 to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Moreover, we develop our vision language model based on our Moxin model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.

Abstract: Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and recommendation systems. However, manual creation of these ontologies is expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general representations. As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies. This paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics, which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies. To this end, we developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader, narrower, same-as, and other. Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning strategies. Several models have achieved outstanding results, including Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847, 0.920, and 0.967, respectively. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.

Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are widely used for searching optimal solutions in complex multi-component applications. Traditional MOEAs for multi-component deep learning (MCDL) systems face challenges in enhancing the search efficiency while maintaining the diversity. To combat these, this paper proposes $\mu$MOEA, the first LLM-empowered adaptive evolutionary search algorithm to detect safety violations in MCDL systems. Inspired by the context-understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), $\mu$MOEA promotes the LLM to comprehend the optimization problem and generate an initial population tailed to evolutionary objectives. Subsequently, it employs adaptive selection and variation to iteratively produce offspring, balancing the evolutionary efficiency and diversity. During the evolutionary process, to navigate away from the local optima, $\mu$MOEA integrates the evolutionary experience back into the LLM. This utilization harnesses the LLM's quantitative reasoning prowess to generate differential seeds, breaking away from current optimal solutions. We evaluate $\mu$MOEA in finding safety violations of MCDL systems, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art MOEA methods. Experimental results show that $\mu$MOEA can significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of the evolutionary search.

<title>TSVC:Tripartite Learning with Semantic Variation Consistency for Robust Image-Text Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval maps data under different modality via semantic relevance. Existing approaches implicitly assume that data pairs are well-aligned and ignore the widely existing annotation noise, i.e., noisy correspondence (NC). Consequently, it inevitably causes performance degradation. Despite attempts that employ the co-teaching paradigm with identical architectures to provide distinct data perspectives, the differences between these architectures are primarily stemmed from random initialization. Thus, the model becomes increasingly homogeneous along with the training process. Consequently, the additional information brought by this paradigm is severely limited. In order to resolve this problem, we introduce a Tripartite learning with Semantic Variation Consistency (TSVC) for robust image-text retrieval. We design a tripartite cooperative learning mechanism comprising a Coordinator, a Master, and an Assistant model. The Coordinator distributes data, and the Assistant model supports the Master model's noisy label prediction with diverse data. Moreover, we introduce a soft label estimation method based on mutual information variation, which quantifies the noise in new samples and assigns corresponding soft labels. We also present a new loss function to enhance robustness and optimize training effectiveness. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, even at increasing noise ratios, TSVC exhibits significant advantages in retrieval accuracy and maintains stable training performance.

Abstract: The generalisation of irony detection faces significant challenges, leading to substantial performance deviations when detection models are applied to diverse real-world scenarios. In this study, we find that irony-focused prompts, as generated from our IDADP framework for LLMs, can not only overcome dataset-specific limitations but also generate coherent, human-readable reasoning, transforming ironic text into its intended meaning. Based on our findings and in-depth analysis, we identify several promising directions for future research aimed at enhancing LLMs' zero-shot capabilities in irony detection, reasoning, and comprehension. These include advancing contextual awareness in irony detection, exploring hybrid symbolic-neural methods, and integrating multimodal data, among others.

Abstract: Bias evaluation is fundamental to trustworthy AI, both in terms of checking data quality and in terms of checking the outputs of AI systems. In testing data quality, for example, one may study the distance of a given dataset, viewed as a distribution, to a given ground-truth reference dataset. However, classical metrics, such as the Total Variation and the Wasserstein distances, are known to have high sample complexities and, therefore, may fail to provide a meaningful distinction in many practical scenarios.
  In this paper, we propose a new notion of distance, the Maximum Subgroup Discrepancy (MSD). In this metric, two distributions are close if, roughly, discrepancies are low for all feature subgroups. While the number of subgroups may be exponential, we show that the sample complexity is linear in the number of features, thus making it feasible for practical applications. Moreover, we provide a practical algorithm for evaluating the distance based on Mixed-integer optimization (MIO). We also note that the proposed distance is easily interpretable, thus providing clearer paths to fixing the biases once they have been identified. Finally, we describe a natural general bias detection framework, termed MSDD distances, and show that MSD aligns well with this framework. We empirically evaluate MSD by comparing it with other metrics and by demonstrating the above properties of MSD on real-world datasets.

Abstract: Recent research builds various patching agents that combine large language models (LLMs) with non-ML tools and achieve promising results on the state-of-the-art (SOTA) software patching benchmark, SWE-bench. Based on how to determine the patching workflows, existing patching agents can be categorized as agent-based planning methods, which rely on LLMs for planning, and rule-based planning methods, which follow a pre-defined workflow. At a high level, agent-based planning methods achieve high patching performance but with a high cost and limited stability. Rule-based planning methods, on the other hand, are more stable and efficient but have key workflow limitations that compromise their patching performance. In this paper, we propose PatchPilot, an agentic patcher that strikes a balance between patching efficacy, stability, and cost-efficiency. PatchPilot proposes a novel rule-based planning workflow with five components: reproduction, localization, generation, validation, and refinement (where refinement is unique to PatchPilot). We introduce novel and customized designs to each component to optimize their effectiveness and efficiency. Through extensive experiments on the SWE-bench benchmarks, PatchPilot shows a superior performance than existing open-source methods while maintaining low cost (less than 1$ per instance) and ensuring higher stability. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in each component. Our code is available at https://github.com/ucsb-mlsec/PatchPilot.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents capable of autonomous learning and independent decision-making hold great promise for addressing complex challenges across various critical infrastructure domains, including transportation, energy systems, and manufacturing. However, the surge in the design and deployment of AI systems, driven by various stakeholders with distinct and unaligned objectives, introduces a crucial challenge: How can uncoordinated AI systems coexist and evolve harmoniously in shared environments without creating chaos or compromising safety? To address this, we advocate for a fundamental rethinking of existing multi-agent frameworks, such as multi-agent systems and game theory, which are largely limited to predefined rules and static objective structures. We posit that AI agents should be empowered to adjust their objectives dynamically, make compromises, form coalitions, and safely compete or cooperate through evolving relationships and social feedback. Through two case studies in critical infrastructure applications, we call for a shift toward the emergent, self-organizing, and context-aware nature of these multi-agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require essential model training resources, lack effectiveness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON (Masked re-Execution and TooL comparisON), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent's next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we design MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent's trajectory with a masked user prompt modified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false positives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. Moreover, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to validate our key designs. Code is available at https://github.com/kaijiezhu11/MELON.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as a critical technique for efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). This work proposes NestQuant, a novel PTQ scheme for weights and activations that is based on self-similar nested lattices. Recent works have mathematically shown such quantizers to be information-theoretically optimal for low-precision matrix multiplication. We implement a practical low-complexity version of NestQuant based on Gosset lattice, making it a drop-in quantizer for any matrix multiplication step (e.g., in self-attention, MLP etc). For example, NestQuant quantizes weights, KV-cache, and activations of Llama-3-8B to 4 bits, achieving perplexity of 6.6 on wikitext2. This represents more than 55% reduction in perplexity gap with respect to unquantized model (perplexity of 6.14) compared to state-of-the-art Metas SpinQuant (perplexity 7.3), OstQuant (7.3) and QuaRot (8.2). Comparisons on bigger models (up to 70B) and on various LLM evaluation benchmarks confirm uniform superiority of NestQuant.

Abstract: The capabilities of artificial intelligence systems have been advancing to a great extent, but these systems still struggle with failure modes, vulnerabilities, and biases. In this paper, we study the current state of the field, and present promising insights and perspectives regarding concerns that challenge the trustworthiness of AI models. In particular, this paper investigates the issues regarding three thrusts: safety, privacy, and bias, which hurt models' trustworthiness. For safety, we discuss safety alignment in the context of large language models, preventing them from generating toxic or harmful content. For bias, we focus on spurious biases that can mislead a network. Lastly, for privacy, we cover membership inference attacks in deep neural networks. The discussions addressed in this paper reflect our own experiments and observations.

Abstract: As machine learning-based prediction systems are increasingly used in high-stakes situations, it is important to understand how such predictive models will perform upon deployment. Distribution-free uncertainty quantification techniques such as conformal prediction provide guarantees about the loss black-box models will incur even when the details of the models are hidden. However, such methods are based on frequentist probability, which unduly limits their applicability. We revisit the central aspects of conformal prediction from a Bayesian perspective and thereby illuminate the shortcomings of frequentist guarantees. We propose a practical alternative based on Bayesian quadrature that provides interpretable guarantees and offers a richer representation of the likely range of losses to be observed at test time.

<title>Lost in Sequence: Do Large Language Models Understand Sequential Recommendation?</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as promising tools for recommendation thanks to their advanced textual understanding ability and context-awareness. Despite the current practice of training and evaluating LLM-based recommendation (LLM4Rec) models under a sequential recommendation scenario, we found that whether these models understand the sequential information inherent in users' item interaction sequences has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first demonstrate through a series of experiments that existing LLM4Rec models do not fully capture sequential information both during training and inference. Then, we propose a simple yet effective LLM-based sequential recommender, called LLM-SRec, a method that enhances the integration of sequential information into LLMs by distilling the user representations extracted from a pre-trained CF-SRec model into LLMs. Our extensive experiments show that LLM-SRec enhances LLMs' ability to understand users' item interaction sequences, ultimately leading to improved recommendation performance. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM4Rec models that require fine-tuning of LLMs, LLM-SRec achieves state-of-the-art performance by training only a few lightweight MLPs, highlighting its practicality in real-world applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/Sein-Kim/LLM-SRec.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made them powerful tools in embodied navigation, enabling agents to leverage commonsense and spatial reasoning for efficient exploration in unfamiliar environments. Existing LLM-based approaches convert global memory, such as semantic or topological maps, into language descriptions to guide navigation. While this improves efficiency and reduces redundant exploration, the loss of geometric information in language-based representations hinders spatial reasoning, especially in intricate environments. To address this, VLM-based approaches directly process ego-centric visual inputs to select optimal directions for exploration. However, relying solely on a first-person perspective makes navigation a partially observed decision-making problem, leading to suboptimal decisions in complex environments. In this paper, we present a novel vision-language model (VLM)-based navigation framework that addresses these challenges by adaptively retrieving task-relevant cues from a global memory module and integrating them with the agent's egocentric observations. By dynamically aligning global contextual information with local perception, our approach enhances spatial reasoning and decision-making in long-horizon tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses previous state-of-the-art approaches in object navigation tasks, providing a more effective and scalable solution for embodied navigation.

<title>Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR): A New Benchmark for Multimodal Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are predominantly trained and tested on consistent visual-textual inputs, leaving open the question of whether they can handle inconsistencies in real-world, layout-rich content. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR) benchmark to assess MLLMs' ability to detect and reason about semantic mismatches in artifacts such as webpages, presentation slides, and posters. MMIR comprises 534 challenging samples, each containing synthetically injected errors across five reasoning-heavy categories: Factual Contradiction, Identity Misattribution, Contextual Mismatch, Quantitative Discrepancy, and Temporal/Spatial Incoherence. We evaluate six state-of-the-art MLLMs, showing that models with dedicated multimodal reasoning capabilities, such as o1, substantially outperform their counterparts while open-source models remain particularly vulnerable to inconsistency errors. Detailed error analyses further show that models excel in detecting pairwise inconsistencies but struggle with inconsistencies confined to single elements in complex layouts. Probing experiments reveal that single-modality prompting, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Set-of-Mark (SoM) methods, yields marginal gains, revealing a key bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. Our findings highlight the need for advanced multimodal reasoning and point to future research on multimodal inconsistency.

Abstract: Auditory foundation models, including auditory large language models (LLMs), process all sound inputs equally, independent of listener perception. However, human auditory perception is inherently selective: listeners focus on specific speakers while ignoring others in complex auditory scenes. Existing models do not incorporate this selectivity, limiting their ability to generate perception-aligned responses. To address this, we introduce Intention-Informed Auditory Scene Understanding (II-ASU) and present Auditory Attention-Driven LLM (AAD-LLM), a prototype system that integrates brain signals to infer listener attention. AAD-LLM extends an auditory LLM by incorporating intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings to decode which speaker a listener is attending to and refine responses accordingly. The model first predicts the attended speaker from neural activity, then conditions response generation on this inferred attentional state. We evaluate AAD-LLM on speaker description, speech transcription and extraction, and question answering in multitalker scenarios, with both objective and subjective ratings showing improved alignment with listener intention. By taking a first step toward intention-aware auditory AI, this work explores a new paradigm where listener perception informs machine listening, paving the way for future listener-centered auditory systems.

<title>Revisiting Self-Consistency from Dynamic Distributional Alignment Perspective on Answer Aggregation</title>

arXiv:2502.19830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-consistency improves reasoning by aggregating diverse stochastic samples, yet the dynamics behind its efficacy remain underexplored. We reframe self-consistency as a dynamic distributional alignment problem, revealing that decoding temperature not only governs sampling randomness but also actively shapes the latent answer distribution. Given that high temperatures require prohibitively large sample sizes to stabilize, while low temperatures risk amplifying biases, we propose a confidence-driven mechanism that dynamically calibrates temperature: sharpening the sampling distribution under uncertainty to align with high-probability modes, and promoting exploration when confidence is high. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show this approach outperforms fixed-diversity baselines under limited samples, improving both average and best-case performance across varying initial temperatures without additional data or modules. This establishes self-consistency as a synchronization challenge between sampling dynamics and evolving answer distributions.

Abstract: Marine ecosystem monitoring via Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) generates vast data, but deep learning often requires precise annotations and short segments. We introduce DSMIL-LocNet, a Multiple Instance Learning framework for whale call detection and localization using only bag-level labels. Our dual-stream model processes 2-30 minute audio segments, leveraging spectral and temporal features with attention-based instance selection. Tests on Antarctic whale data show longer contexts improve classification (F1: 0.8-0.9) while medium instances ensure localization precision (0.65-0.70). This suggests MIL can enhance scalable marine monitoring. Code: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/DSMIL-Loc

<title>FC-Attack: Jailbreaking Multimodal Large Language Models via Auto-Generated Flowcharts</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most MLLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, MLLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute the jailbreak attack on MLLMs. Our evaluations on Advbench show that FC-Attack attains an attack success rate of up to 96% via images and up to 78% via videos across multiple MLLMs. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. We also find that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.

<title>AskToAct: Enhancing LLMs Tool Use via Self-Correcting Clarification</title>

arXiv:2503.01940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tool learning. In real-world scenarios, user queries are often ambiguous and incomplete, requiring effective clarification. However, existing interactive clarification approaches face two critical limitations: reliance on manually constructed datasets, which inherently constrains training data scale and diversity, and lack of error correction mechanisms during multi-turn clarification, leading to error accumulation that compromises both accuracy and efficiency. We present AskToAct, which addresses these challenges by exploiting the structural mapping between queries and their tool invocation solutions. Our key insight is that tool parameters naturally represent explicit user intents. By systematically removing key parameters from queries while retaining them as ground truth, we enable automated construction of high-quality training data. We further enhance model robustness through error-correction pairs and selective masking, enabling dynamic error detection during clarification interactions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AskToAct significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving above 57% accuracy in recovering critical unspecified intents and enhancing clarification efficiency by an average of 10.46% while maintaining high accuracy in tool invocation. Our framework exhibits robust performance across different model architectures and successfully generalizes to entirely unseen APIs without additional training, achieving performance comparable to GPT-4o with substantially fewer computational resources.

Abstract: Revolutionizing drug discovery demands more than just understanding molecular interactions - it requires generative models that can design novel ligands tailored to specific biological targets. While chemical Language Models (cLMs) have made strides in learning molecular properties, most fail to incorporate target-specific insights, restricting their ability to drive de-novo ligand generation. Chem42, a cutting-edge family of generative chemical Language Models, is designed to bridge this gap. By integrating atomic-level interactions with multimodal inputs from Prot42, a complementary protein Language Model, Chem42 achieves a sophisticated cross-modal representation of molecular structures, interactions, and binding patterns. This innovative framework enables the creation of structurally valid, synthetically accessible ligands with enhanced target specificity. Evaluations across diverse protein targets confirm that Chem42 surpasses existing approaches in chemical validity, target-aware design, and predicted binding affinity. By reducing the search space of viable drug candidates, Chem42 could accelerate the drug discovery pipeline, offering a powerful generative AI tool for precision medicine. Our Chem42 models set a new benchmark in molecule property prediction, conditional molecule generation, and target-aware ligand design. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.

<title>Temporal-Guided Spiking Neural Networks for Event-Based Human Action Recognition</title>

Abstract: This paper explores the promising interplay between spiking neural networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras for privacy-preserving human action recognition (HAR). The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.

Abstract: Specialized reasoning language models (RLMs) have demonstrated that scaling test-time computation through detailed reasoning traces significantly enhances performance. Although these traces effectively facilitate knowledge distillation into smaller, instruction-tuned models, the precise nature of transferred reasoning remains unclear. In this study, we investigate to what extent distilled models internalize replicated stylistic patterns during reasoning. To this end, we systematically analyze reasoning traces, identifying structural and lexical patterns that characterize successful reasoning. We then introduce two new datasets -- a dataset of emergent reasoning traces and a synthetic dataset explicitly constructed to replicate these stylistic patterns -- to precisely examine their influence on distilled models' reasoning capabilities. We find that models trained on the synthetic traces achieve comparable performance, indicating that distilled reasoning abilities rely significantly on surface-level patterns. Surprisingly, we observe an increase in performance even when the synthetic traces are altered to lead to the wrong answer. Our findings highlight how stylistic patterns can be leveraged to efficiently enhance LM reasoning across diverse model families.

Abstract: Neural networks are fundamental in artificial intelligence, driving progress in computer vision and natural language processing. High-quality datasets are crucial for their development, and there is growing interest in datasets composed of neural networks themselves to support benchmarking, automated machine learning (AutoML), and model analysis. We introduce LEMUR, an open source dataset of neural network models with well-structured code for diverse architectures across tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, and natural language processing. LEMUR is primarily designed to provide a rich source of structured model representations and associated performance data, enabling the fine-tuning of large language models for AutoML applications. Leveraging Python and PyTorch, LEMUR enables seamless extension to new datasets and models while maintaining consistency. It integrates an Optuna-powered framework for evaluation, hyperparameter optimization, statistical analysis, and graphical insights. LEMUR VR extension enables the seamless deployment of models in virtual reality, optimizing their performance on resource-constrained devices. Providing tools for model evaluation, preprocessing, and database management, LEMUR supports researchers and practitioners in developing, testing, and analyzing neural networks. It offers an API that delivers comprehensive information about neural network models and their complete performance statistics with a single request, which can be used in experiments with code-generating large language models. The LEMUR and its plugins are accessible as open source projects under the MIT license at https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-dataset, https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-plots and https://github.com/ABrain-One/nn-vr.

Abstract: We present TerraMind, the first any-to-any generative, multimodal foundation model for Earth observation (EO). Unlike other multimodal models, TerraMind is pretrained on dual-scale representations combining both token-level and pixel-level data across modalities. On a token level, TerraMind encodes high-level contextual information to learn cross-modal relationships, while on a pixel level, TerraMind leverages fine-grained representations to capture critical spatial nuances. We pretrained TerraMind on nine geospatial modalities of a global, large-scale dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that (i) TerraMind's dual-scale early fusion approach unlocks a range of zero-shot and few-shot applications for Earth observation, (ii) TerraMind introduces "Thinking-in-Modalities" (TiM) -- the capability of generating additional artificial data during finetuning and inference to improve the model output -- and (iii) TerraMind achieves beyond state-of-the-art performance in community-standard benchmarks for EO like PANGAEA. The pretraining dataset, the model weights, and our code are open-sourced under a permissive license.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown increasing promise in educational settings, yet their mathematical reasoning has been considered evolving. This study evaluates the mathematical capabilities of various LLMs using the Finnish matriculation examination, a high-stakes digital test for upper secondary education. Initial tests yielded moderate performance corresponding to mid-range grades, but later evaluations demonstrated substantial improvements as the language models evolved. Remarkably, some models achieved near-perfect or perfect scores, matching top student performance and qualifying for university admission. Our findings highlight the rapid advances in the mathematical proficiency of LLMs and illustrate their potential as underlying tools to support learning and teaching in a variety of ways.

Abstract: Aligning language models with human preferences presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving personalization without incurring excessive computational costs. Existing methods rely on reward signals and additional annotated data, limiting their scalability and adaptability to diverse human values. To address these challenges, we introduce Persona-judge, a novel discriminative paradigm that enables training-free personalized alignment with unseen preferences. Instead of optimizing policy parameters through external reward feedback, Persona-judge leverages the intrinsic preference judgment capabilities of the model. Specifically, a draft model generates candidate tokens conditioned on a given preference, while a judge model, embodying another preference, cross-validates the predicted tokens whether to be accepted. Experimental results demonstrate that Persona-judge, using the inherent preference evaluation mechanisms of the model, offers a scalable and computationally efficient solution to personalized alignment, paving the way for more adaptive customized alignment. Our code is available here.

arXiv:2504.18574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State-space models (SSMs) offer efficient alternatives to Transformers for long sequences, but their fixed-size recurrent state limits capability on algorithmic tasks, such as retrieving past context. In this work, we examine how in-context retrieval operates in Transformer- and SSM-based language models and find that both rely on a similar Gather-and-Aggregate (G&amp;A) mechanism: a Gather Head extracts relevant information pieces from context, which an Aggregate Head integrates into a single representation. In both architectures, G&amp;A concentrates in a few heads, forming critical bottlenecks even for simple retrieval. For example, we show that disabling a single Gather or Aggregate Head in a pruned Llama-3.1-8B impairs retrieving the correct answer letter in MMLU, reducing its accuracy from 66% to 25% (random guessing). Moreover, this retrieval bottleneck can obscure limited knowledge demands of tasks as the pruned model succeeds on MMLU with functioning G&amp;A heads yet fails on other knowledge benchmarks. The bottleneck similarly extends to tasks where SSMs typically underperform, such as GSM8K, BBH, and dialogue comprehension. We show that SSMs' retrieval challenges manifest in these heads, creating smoother attention patterns instead of the sharp token transitions effective G&amp;A requires. Thus, the Transformer-SSM retrieval gap exists in just a few heads, rather than the entire language model. This suggests a unified explanation for Transformer vs. SSM performance gap while showing how to merge their strengths. We find that pretrained hybrid models, where SSMs are combined with a few attention layers, delegate the role of Aggregate Heads to attention. Similarly, replacing a single G&amp;A head in a pretrained SSM with an attention variant boosts retrieval and benchmark scores.

Abstract: We introduce Griffin, the first foundation model attemptation designed specifically for Relational Databases (RDBs). Unlike previous smaller models focused on single RDB tasks, Griffin unifies the data encoder and task decoder to handle diverse tasks. Additionally, we enhance the architecture by incorporating a cross-attention module and a novel aggregator. Griffin utilizes pretraining on both single-table and RDB datasets, employing advanced encoders for categorical, numerical, and metadata features, along with innovative components such as cross-attention modules and enhanced message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture the complexities of relational data. Evaluated on large-scale, heterogeneous, and temporal graphs extracted from RDBs across various domains (spanning over 150 million nodes), Griffin demonstrates superior or comparable performance to individually trained models, excels in low-data scenarios, and shows strong transferability with similarity and diversity in pretraining across new datasets and tasks, highlighting its potential as a universally applicable foundation model for RDBs.

Abstract: Emotional support conversation (ESC) aims to alleviate the emotional distress of individuals through effective conversations. Although large language models (LLMs) have obtained remarkable progress on ESC, most of these studies might not define the diagram from the state model perspective, therefore providing a suboptimal solution for long-term satisfaction. To address such an issue, we leverage the Q-learning on LLMs, and propose a framework called straQ*. Our framework allows a plug-and-play LLM to bootstrap the planning during ESC, determine the optimal strategy based on long-term returns, and finally guide the LLM to response. Substantial experiments on ESC datasets suggest that straQ* outperforms many baselines, including direct inference, self-refine, chain of thought, finetuning, and finite state machines.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) poses a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), exposing limitations in their abstract reasoning abilities. In this work, we leverage task-specific data augmentations throughout the training, generation, and scoring phases, and employ a depth-first search algorithm to generate diverse, high-probability candidate solutions. Furthermore, we utilize the LLM not only as a generator but also as a scorer, using its output probabilities to select the most promising solutions. Our method achieves a score of 71.6% (286.5/400 solved tasks) on the public ARC-AGI evaluation set, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance among publicly available approaches. While concurrent closed-source work has reported higher scores, our method distinguishes itself through its transparency, reproducibility, and remarkably low inference cost, averaging only around 2ct per task on readily available hardware (we assume a price of 36ct/hour for a Nvidia 4090 GPU).

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) as feature enhancers to optimize node representations, which are then used as inputs for graph neural networks (GNNs), has shown significant potential in graph representation learning. However, the fundamental properties of this approach remain underexplored. To address this issue, we propose conducting a more in-depth analysis of this issue based on the interchange intervention method. First, we construct a synthetic graph dataset with controllable causal relationships, enabling precise manipulation of semantic relationships and causal modeling to provide data for analysis. Using this dataset, we conduct interchange interventions to examine the deeper properties of LLM enhancers and GNNs, uncovering their underlying logic and internal mechanisms. Building on the analytical results, we design a plug-and-play optimization module to improve the information transfer between LLM enhancers and GNNs. Experiments across multiple datasets and models validate the proposed module.

<title>Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems</title>

Abstract: Prevailing accounts in both multi-agent AI and the social sciences explain social structure through top-down abstractions-such as institutions, norms, or trust-yet lack simulateable models of how such structures emerge from individual behavior. Ethnographic and archaeological evidence suggests that reciprocity served as the foundational mechanism of early human societies, enabling economic circulation, social cohesion, and interpersonal obligation long before the rise of formal institutions. Modern financial systems such as credit and currency can likewise be viewed as scalable extensions of reciprocity, formalizing exchange across time and anonymity. Building on this insight, we argue that reciprocity is not merely a local or primitive exchange heuristic, but the scalable substrate from which large-scale social structures can emerge. We propose a three-stage framework to model this emergence: reciprocal dynamics at the individual level, norm stabilization through shared expectations, and the construction of durable institutional patterns. This approach offers a cognitively minimal, behaviorally grounded foundation for simulating how large-scale social systems can emerge from decentralized reciprocal interaction.

<title>Fine-tuning Diffusion Policies with Backpropagation Through Diffusion Timesteps</title>

Abstract: Diffusion policies, widely adopted in decision-making scenarios such as robotics, gaming and autonomous driving, are capable of learning diverse skills from demonstration data due to their high representation power. However, the sub-optimal and limited coverage of demonstration data could lead to diffusion policies that generate sub-optimal trajectories and even catastrophic failures. While reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, existing approaches struggle to effectively adapt Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to diffusion models. This challenge stems from the computational intractability of action likelihood estimation during the denoising process, which leads to complicated optimization objectives. In our experiments starting from randomly initialized policies, we find that online tuning of Diffusion Policies demonstrates much lower sample efficiency compared to directly applying PPO on MLP policies (MLP+PPO). To address these challenges, we introduce NCDPO, a novel framework that reformulates Diffusion Policy as a noise-conditioned deterministic policy. By treating each denoising step as a differentiable transformation conditioned on pre-sampled noise, NCDPO enables tractable likelihood evaluation and gradient backpropagation through all diffusion timesteps. Our experiments demonstrate that NCDPO achieves sample efficiency comparable to MLP+PPO when training from scratch, outperforming existing methods in both sample efficiency and final performance across diverse benchmarks, including continuous robot control and multi-agent game scenarios. Furthermore, our experimental results show that our method is robust to the number denoising timesteps in the Diffusion Policy.

<title>LIFEBench: Evaluating Length Instruction Following in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) can solve PhD-level reasoning problems over long context inputs, they still struggle with a seemingly simpler task: following explicit length instructions-e.g., write a 10,000-word novel. Additionally, models often generate far too short outputs, terminate prematurely, or even refuse the request. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on evaluating generations quality, but often overlook whether the generations meet length constraints. To this end, we introduce Length Instruction Following Evaluation Benchmark (LIFEBench) to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to follow length instructions across diverse tasks and a wide range of specified lengths. LIFEBench consists of 10,800 instances across 4 task categories in both English and Chinese, covering length constraints ranging from 16 to 8192 words. We evaluate 26 widely-used LLMs and find that most models reasonably follow short-length instructions but deteriorate sharply beyond a certain threshold. Surprisingly, almost all models fail to reach the vendor-claimed maximum output lengths in practice, as further confirmed by our evaluations extending up to 32K words. Even long-context LLMs, despite their extended input-output windows, counterintuitively fail to improve length-instructions following. Notably, Reasoning LLMs outperform even specialized long-text generation models, achieving state-of-the-art length following. Overall, LIFEBench uncovers fundamental limitations in current LLMs' length instructions following ability, offering critical insights for future progress.

Abstract: Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and develop a refusal discovery method, Iterated Prefill Crawler (IPC), that uses token prefilling to find forbidden topics. We benchmark IPC on Tulu-3-8B, an open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale the crawler to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku. Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, IPC elicits CCP-aligned refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment failures of AI systems.

<title>Follow the Energy, Find the Path: Riemannian Metrics from Energy-Based Models</title>

Abstract: What is the shortest path between two data points lying in a high-dimensional space? While the answer is trivial in Euclidean geometry, it becomes significantly more complex when the data lies on a curved manifold -- requiring a Riemannian metric to describe the space's local curvature. Estimating such a metric, however, remains a major challenge in high dimensions.
  In this work, we propose a method for deriving Riemannian metrics directly from pretrained Energy-Based Models (EBMs) -- a class of generative models that assign low energy to high-density regions. These metrics define spatially varying distances, enabling the computation of geodesics -- shortest paths that follow the data manifold's intrinsic geometry. We introduce two novel metrics derived from EBMs and show that they produce geodesics that remain closer to the data manifold and exhibit lower curvature distortion, as measured by alignment with ground-truth trajectories. We evaluate our approach on increasingly complex datasets: synthetic datasets with known data density, rotated character images with interpretable geometry, and high-resolution natural images embedded in a pretrained VAE latent space.
  Our results show that EBM-derived metrics consistently outperform established baselines, especially in high-dimensional settings. Our work is the first to derive Riemannian metrics from EBMs, enabling data-aware geodesics and unlocking scalable, geometry-driven learning for generative modeling and simulation.

Abstract: In recent years, protein-text models have gained significant attention for their potential in protein generation and understanding. Current approaches focus on integrating protein-related knowledge into large language models through continued pretraining and multi-modal alignment, enabling simultaneous comprehension of textual descriptions and protein sequences. Through a thorough analysis of existing model architectures and text-based protein understanding benchmarks, we identify significant data leakage issues present in current benchmarks. Moreover, conventional metrics derived from natural language processing fail to accurately assess the model's performance in this domain. To address these limitations, we reorganize existing datasets and introduce a novel evaluation framework based on biological entities. Motivated by our observation, we propose a retrieval-enhanced method, which significantly outperforms fine-tuned LLMs for protein-to-text generation and shows accuracy and efficiency in training-free scenarios. Our code and data can be seen at https://github.com/IDEA-XL/RAPM.

Abstract: Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.

<title>SplitLoRA: Balancing Stability and Plasticity in Continual Learning Through Gradient Space Splitting</title>

Abstract: Continual Learning requires a model to learn multiple tasks in sequence while maintaining both stability:preserving knowledge from previously learned tasks, and plasticity:effectively learning new tasks. Gradient projection has emerged as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography enables in vivo mapping of brain structural connections, but traditional connectome generation is time-consuming and requires gray matter parcellation, posing challenges for large-scale studies. We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.

Abstract: Scaling has been a major driver of recent advancements in deep learning. Numerous empirical studies have found that scaling laws often follow the power-law and proposed several variants of power-law functions to predict the scaling behavior at larger scales. However, existing methods mostly rely on point estimation and do not quantify uncertainty, which is crucial for real-world applications involving decision-making problems such as determining the expected performance improvements achievable by investing additional computational resources. In this work, we explore a Bayesian framework based on Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFNs) for neural scaling law extrapolation. Specifically, we design a prior distribution that enables the sampling of infinitely many synthetic functions resembling real-world neural scaling laws, allowing our PFN to meta-learn the extrapolation. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on real-world neural scaling laws, comparing it against both the existing point estimation methods and Bayesian approaches. Our method demonstrates superior performance, particularly in data-limited scenarios such as Bayesian active learning, underscoring its potential for reliable, uncertainty-aware extrapolation in practical applications.

Abstract: The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE, Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mistral-7B). Results show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation, late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement" framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination. Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10 experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency, specialization, and robustness.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.

Abstract: Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries, and environmental monitoring. However, their high dimensionality, large data volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite data. ImpliSat leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while preserving critical image details.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

Abstract: In this report, we present a novel three-stage framework developed for the Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CorrineQiu/Ego4D-LTA-Challenge-2025.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.04704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite emerging efforts to enhance the safety of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current approaches face two main shortcomings. 1) Existing safety-tuning datasets and benchmarks only partially consider how image-text interactions can yield harmful content, often overlooking contextually unsafe outcomes from seemingly benign pairs. This narrow coverage leaves VLMs vulnerable to jailbreak attacks in unseen configurations. 2) Prior methods rely primarily on data-centric tuning, with limited architectural innovations to intrinsically strengthen safety. We address these gaps by introducing a holistic safety dataset and benchmark, HoliSafe, that spans all five safe/unsafe image-text combinations, providing a more robust basis for both training and evaluation. We further propose SafeLLaVA, a novel VLM augmented with a learnable safety meta token and a dedicated safety head. The meta token encodes harmful visual cues during training, intrinsically guiding the language model toward safer responses, while the safety head offers interpretable harmfulness classification aligned with refusal rationales. Experiments show that SafeLLaVA, trained on HoliSafe, achieves state-of-the-art safety performance across multiple VLM benchmarks. Additionally, the HoliSafe benchmark itself reveals critical vulnerabilities in existing models. We hope that HoliSafe and SafeLLaVA will spur further research into robust and interpretable VLM safety, expanding future avenues for multimodal alignment.

<title>Context Is Not Comprehension: Unmasking LLM reasoning blind spots with VLO</title>

arXiv:2506.04907v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominant evaluation of Large Language Models has centered on their ability to surface explicit facts from increasingly vast contexts. While today's best models demonstrate near-perfect recall on these tasks, this apparent success is overly simplistic and non-representative of the complexity of human reasoning which is often highly nested. We introduce Verbose ListOps (VLO), a novel benchmark designed to isolate this failure. VLO programmatically weaves deterministic, nested computations into coherent stories, forcing models to track and update internal state rather than simply locate explicit values. Our experiments show that leading LLMs, capable of solving the raw ListOps equations with near-perfect accuracy, collapse in performance on VLO at just 10k tokens. The extensibility of VLO's generation framework to any verifiable reasoning pattern will be a critical tool, enabling model developers to move beyond context windows and robustly test new reasoning architectures; a necessary step to automating the world's knowledge work.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse scenes, tasks, and robotic platforms when pretrained at large-scale datasets. However, these models still require task-specific fine-tuning in novel environments, a process that relies almost exclusively on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using static trajectory datasets. Such approaches neither allow robot to interact with environment nor do they leverage feedback from live execution. Also, their success is critically dependent on the size and quality of the collected trajectories. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling closed-loop interaction and aligning learned policies directly with task objectives. In this work, we draw inspiration from the ideas of GRPO and propose the Trajectory-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO) method. By fusing step-level and trajectory-level advantage signals, this method improves GRPO's group-level advantage estimation, thereby making the algorithm more suitable for online reinforcement learning training of VLA. Experimental results on ten manipulation tasks from the libero-object benchmark demonstrate that TGRPO consistently outperforms various baseline methods, capable of generating more robust and efficient policies across multiple tested scenarios.

<div> fluctuations, benchmark evaluation, performance improvements, evaluation conditions, empirical assessments

Summary:
The Deepseek-R1-Distill series reasoning models, popular in the open-source community, exhibit significant fluctuations in benchmark evaluation results due to various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation conditions can result in notable variations in performance outcomes. This variability is also observed in fine-tuned open-source inference models based on the Deepseek-R1-Distill series and the QwQ-32B model, making claimed performance enhancements challenging to replicate consistently. The study calls for a more rigorous approach to model performance evaluation to establish greater reliability and reproducibility.

Abstract: Reasoning models represented by the Deepseek-R1-Distill series have been widely adopted by the open-source community due to their strong performance in mathematics, science, programming, and other domains. However, our study reveals that their benchmark evaluation results are subject to significant fluctuations caused by various factors. Subtle differences in evaluation conditions can lead to substantial variations in results. Similar phenomena are observed in other open-source inference models fine-tuned based on the Deepseek-R1-Distill series, as well as in the QwQ-32B model, making their claimed performance improvements difficult to reproduce reliably. Therefore, we advocate for the establishment of a more rigorous paradigm for model performance evaluation and present our empirical assessments of the Deepseek-R1-Distill series models.

Abstract: Sentence embeddings are central to modern NLP and AI systems, yet little is known about their internal structure. While we can compare these embeddings using measures such as cosine similarity, the contributing features are not human-interpretable, and the content of an embedding seems untraceable, as it is masked by complex neural transformations and a final pooling operation that combines individual token embeddings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new method to mechanistically decompose sentence embeddings into interpretable components, by using dictionary learning on token-level representations. We analyze how pooling compresses these features into sentence representations, and assess the latent features that reside in a sentence embedding. This bridges token-level mechanistic interpretability with sentence-level analysis, making for more transparent and controllable representations. In our studies, we obtain several interesting insights into the inner workings of sentence embedding spaces, for instance, that many semantic and syntactic aspects are linearly encoded in the embeddings.

Abstract: This paper proposes TIP-Search, a time-predictable inference scheduling framework for real-time market prediction under uncertain workloads. Motivated by the strict latency demands in high-frequency financial systems, TIP-Search dynamically selects a deep learning model from a heterogeneous pool, aiming to maximize predictive accuracy while satisfying per-task deadline constraints. Our approach profiles latency and generalization performance offline, then performs online task-aware selection without relying on explicit input domain labels. We evaluate TIP-Search on three real-world limit order book datasets (FI-2010, Binance BTC/USDT, LOBSTER AAPL) and demonstrate that it outperforms static baselines with up to 8.5% improvement in accuracy and 100% deadline satisfaction. Our results highlight the effectiveness of TIP-Search in robust low-latency financial inference under uncertainty.

Summary: This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework for large language models (LLMs) that utilizes a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG) to manage information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry.

arXiv:2506.08098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of capable large language model (LLM) based agents necessitates memory architectures that transcend mere data storage, enabling continuous learning, nuanced reasoning, and dynamic adaptation. Current memory systems often grapple with fundamental limitations in structural flexibility, temporal awareness, and the ability to synthesize higher-level insights from raw interaction data. This paper introduces Cognitive Weave, a novel memory framework centered around a multi-layered spatio-temporal resonance graph (STRG). This graph manages information as semantically rich insight particles (IPs), which are dynamically enriched with resonance keys, signifiers, and situational imprints via a dedicated semantic oracle interface (SOI). These IPs are interconnected through typed relational strands, forming an evolving knowledge tapestry. A key component of Cognitive Weave is the cognitive refinement process, an autonomous mechanism that includes the synthesis of insight aggregates (IAs) condensed, higher-level knowledge structures derived from identified clusters of related IPs. We present comprehensive experimental results demonstrating Cognitive Weave's marked enhancement over existing approaches in long-horizon planning tasks, evolving question-answering scenarios, and multi-session dialogue coherence. The system achieves a notable 34% average improvement in task completion rates and a 42% reduction in mean query latency when compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, this paper explores the ethical considerations inherent in such advanced memory systems, discusses the implications for long-term memory in LLMs, and outlines promising future research trajectories.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive general-purpose reasoning and problem-solving abilities. However, they struggle with executing complex, long-horizon workflows that demand strict adherence to Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), a critical requirement for real-world industrial automation. Despite this need, there is a lack of public benchmarks that reflect the complexity, structure, and domain-specific nuances of SOPs. To address this, we present three main contributions. First, we introduce a synthetic data generation framework to create realistic, industry-grade SOPs that rigorously test the planning, reasoning, and tool-use capabilities of LLM-based agents. Second, using this framework, we develop SOP-Bench, a benchmark of over 1,800 tasks across 10 industrial domains, each with APIs, tool interfaces, and human-validated test cases. Third, we evaluate two prominent agent architectures: Function-Calling and ReAct Agents, on SOP-Bench, observing average success rates of only 27% and 48%, respectively. Remarkably, when the tool registry is much larger than necessary, agents invoke incorrect tools nearly 100% of the time. These findings underscore a substantial gap between current agentic capabilities of LLMs and the demands of automating real-world SOPs. Performance varies significantly by task and domain, highlighting the need for domain-specific benchmarking and architectural choices before deployment. SOP-Bench is publicly available at http://sop-bench.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/. We also release the prompts underpinning the data generation framework to support new domain-specific SOP benchmarks. We invite the community to extend SOP-Bench with SOPs from their industrial domains.

<div> Keywords: peer review, machine learning, AI-assisted, Large Language Models, research agenda <br />
Summary: 
Peer review in machine learning is facing challenges due to the increasing number of submissions and shortage of reviewers. The paper suggests the implementation of AI-assisted peer review as a solution. AI, particularly Large Language Models, can collaborate with humans to enhance review quality, factual verification, reviewer guidance, author support, and decision-making for Area Chairs. However, the development of such systems requires access to detailed and ethical peer review process data. The proposed research agenda includes experiments to validate these AI assistants and addresses technical and ethical challenges. The ML community is encouraged to embrace this AI-assisted future to uphold scientific validation standards and scalability in peer review processes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.08134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer review, the bedrock of scientific advancement in machine learning (ML), is strained by a crisis of scale. Exponential growth in manuscript submissions to premier ML venues such as NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR is outpacing the finite capacity of qualified reviewers, leading to concerns about review quality, consistency, and reviewer fatigue. This position paper argues that AI-assisted peer review must become an urgent research and infrastructure priority. We advocate for a comprehensive AI-augmented ecosystem, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) not as replacements for human judgment, but as sophisticated collaborators for authors, reviewers, and Area Chairs (ACs). We propose specific roles for AI in enhancing factual verification, guiding reviewer performance, assisting authors in quality improvement, and supporting ACs in decision-making. Crucially, we contend that the development of such systems hinges on access to more granular, structured, and ethically-sourced peer review process data. We outline a research agenda, including illustrative experiments, to develop and validate these AI assistants, and discuss significant technical and ethical challenges. We call upon the ML community to proactively build this AI-assisted future, ensuring the continued integrity and scalability of scientific validation, while maintaining high standards of peer review.

Summary:
Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) is enhanced to incorporate quantitative temporal constraints such as durations and deadlines. To tackle scalability issues posed by fine-grained timing constraints in ASP, a computational approach is developed. By utilizing extensions of ASP with difference constraints, the system can handle time-related aspects separately, thus mitigating the impact of time precision on the solution. This decoupling of metric ASP from time granularity ensures a robust and efficient solution regardless of the level of time detail required. The approach provides a way to maintain scalability while effectively managing temporal constraints in ASP applications. <div>

Abstract: We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.

<div> Keywords: astronomical observatories, data transmission, neural compression, lossless compression, astrophysical data

Summary:
Astronomical observatories benefit from remote locations with limited data transmission capabilities due to cold and dark site conditions. Manual design of traditional lossless data compression methods restricts the amount of data acquired. Neural data compression offers promise by learning compression algorithms directly from data and leveraging unique structures in astronomical images. The introduction of AstroCompress presents a neural compression challenge for astrophysics data, including diverse datasets such as space-based, ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. Benchmarking seven compression methods, including neural and non-neural techniques, showed that neural compression methods can enhance data collection at observatories. While the study focused on lossless compression, future exploration of lossy compression methods is also considered. <div>

Abstract: The site conditions that make astronomical observatories in space and on the ground so desirable -- cold and dark -- demand a physical remoteness that leads to limited data transmission capabilities. Such transmission limitations directly bottleneck the amount of data acquired and in an era of costly modern observatories, any improvements in lossless data compression has the potential scale to billions of dollars worth of additional science that can be accomplished on the same instrument. Traditional lossless methods for compressing astrophysical data are manually designed. Neural data compression, on the other hand, holds the promise of learning compression algorithms end-to-end from data and outperforming classical techniques by leveraging the unique spatial, temporal, and wavelength structures of astronomical images. This paper introduces AstroCompress: a neural compression challenge for astrophysics data, featuring four new datasets (and one legacy dataset) with 16-bit unsigned integer imaging data in various modes: space-based, ground-based, multi-wavelength, and time-series imaging. We provide code to easily access the data and benchmark seven lossless compression methods (three neural and four non-neural, including all practical state-of-the-art algorithms). Our results on lossless compression indicate that lossless neural compression techniques can enhance data collection at observatories, and provide guidance on the adoption of neural compression in scientific applications. Though the scope of this paper is restricted to lossless compression, we also comment on the potential exploration of lossy compression methods in future studies.

Summary:<br />
LeanTutor is a tutoring system for math proofs that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to interact with students in natural language. The system consists of three modules: autoformalizer/proof-checker, next-step generator, and natural language feedback generator. The autoformalizer accurately formalizes student proofs in Lean and verifies their accuracy. The next-step generator suggests valid next tactics for incorrect proofs using LLM-based candidate generation. The feedback generator provides pedagogically-motivated hints for erroneous proofs. An evaluation on the PeanoBench dataset shows that the autoformalizer performs well in formalizing correct tactics and identifying errors in incorrect proofs. LeanTutor also outperforms a baseline in generating accurate and relevant natural language hints for incorrect proofs. <div>

Abstract: We present LeanTutor, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring system for math proofs. LeanTutor interacts with the student in natural language, formally verifies student-written math proofs in Lean, generates correct next steps, and provides the appropriate instructional guidance. LeanTutor is composed of three modules: (i) an autoformalizer/proof-checker, (ii) a next-step generator, and (iii) a natural language feedback generator. The first module faithfully autoformalizes student proofs into Lean and verifies proof accuracy via successful code compilation. If the proof has an error, the incorrect step is identified. The next-step generator module outputs a valid next Lean tactic for incorrect proofs via LLM-based candidate generation and proof search. The feedback generator module leverages Lean data to produce a pedagogically-motivated natural language hint for the student user. To evaluate our system, we introduce PeanoBench, a human-written dataset derived from the Natural Numbers Game, consisting of 371 Peano Arithmetic proofs, where each natural language proof step is paired with the corresponding logically equivalent tactic in Lean. The Autoformalizer correctly formalizes 57% of tactics in correct proofs and accurately identifies the incorrect step in 30% of incorrect proofs. In generating natural language hints for erroneous proofs, LeanTutor outperforms a simple baseline on accuracy and relevance metrics.

Summary: 
Machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly integral in optimizing complex engineering workflows, particularly in integrated circuit design. The implementation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for enhancing high-dimensional optimization tasks in hardware design. A new LLM-based iterative optimization agent, ORFS-agent, has been introduced to automate parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. Through adaptive exploration of parameter configurations, ORFS-agent has shown superior performance compared to traditional Bayesian optimization methods in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Empirical evaluations on various circuit benchmarks have demonstrated significant improvements in routed wirelength and effective clock period, with a reduction in optimization iterations. Additionally, ORFS-agent offers a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization by allowing users to trade off certain metrics for others, all while being modular and model-agnostic for seamless integration with different LLMs. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.08332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning has been widely used to optimize complex engineering workflows across numerous domains. In the context of integrated circuit design, modern flows (e.g., going from a register-transfer level netlist to physical layouts) involve extensive configuration via thousands of parameters, and small changes to these parameters can have large downstream impacts on desired outcomes - namely design performance, power, and area. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for learning and reasoning within such high-dimensional optimization tasks. In this work, we introduce ORFS-agent, an LLM-based iterative optimization agent that automates parameter tuning in an open-source hardware design flow. ORFS-agent adaptively explores parameter configurations, demonstrating clear improvements over standard Bayesian optimization approaches in terms of resource efficiency and final design metrics. Our empirical evaluations on two different technology nodes and a range of circuit benchmarks indicate that ORFS-agent can improve both routed wirelength and effective clock period by over 13%, all while using 40% fewer optimization iterations. Moreover, by following natural language objectives to trade off certain metrics for others, ORFS-agent demonstrates a flexible and interpretable framework for multi-objective optimization. Crucially, RFS-agent is modular and model-agnostic, and can be plugged in to any frontier LLM without any further fine-tuning.

<br />
Summary: <br />
FloorplanMAE is proposed for predicting complete floor plans from partial ones in architectural design, improving efficiency and reducing workload. A floor plan dataset, FloorplanNet, was created and a method based on Masked Autoencoders and Vision Transformer was developed for reconstruction. Results confirmed accurate reconstruction and potential application in architectural design. <div>
arXiv:2506.08363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the architectural design process, floorplan design is often a dynamic and iterative process. Architects progressively draw various parts of the floorplan according to their ideas and requirements, continuously adjusting and refining throughout the design process. Therefore, the ability to predict a complete floorplan from a partial one holds significant value in the design process. Such prediction can help architects quickly generate preliminary designs, improve design efficiency, and reduce the workload associated with repeated modifications. To address this need, we propose FloorplanMAE, a self-supervised learning framework for restoring incomplete floor plans into complete ones. First, we developed a floor plan reconstruction dataset, FloorplanNet, specifically trained on architectural floor plans. Secondly, we propose a floor plan reconstruction method based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which reconstructs missing parts by masking sections of the floor plan and training a lightweight Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated the reconstruction accuracy of FloorplanMAE and compared it with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Additionally, we validated the model using real sketches from the early stages of architectural design. Experimental results show that the FloorplanMAE model can generate high-quality complete floor plans from incomplete partial plans. This framework provides a scalable solution for floor plan generation, with broad application prospects.

<div> keyword: large reasoning models, reasoning strength, activations, directional vector, overthinking behavior detection

Summary:
Large reasoning models (LRMs) have been observed to allocate more reasoning strength for harder problems, showing a difficulty-aware behavior that enhances task performance. This phenomenon is explained by the pre-allocation of reasoning strengths in the activations of LRMs, determined by a directional vector. The magnitude of this vector influences the amount of reasoning tokens used, with the model estimating required strength based on question activations. Manipulating this directional vector affects reasoning token number and performance, highlighting its significance in LRM functioning. Additionally, the vector predicts reasoning length and modifies end-of-reasoning token logits. Practical applications include detecting overthinking behavior and optimizing reasoning efficiency for simpler problems. By uncovering these internal mechanisms, this study offers insights into LRM reasoning processes and tools for controlling their behavior.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.08390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies empirically reveal that large reasoning models (LRMs) can automatically allocate more reasoning strengths (i.e., the number of reasoning tokens) for harder problems, exhibiting difficulty-awareness for better task performance. While this automatic reasoning strength allocation phenomenon has been widely observed, its underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. To this end, we provide explanations for this phenomenon from the perspective of model activations. We find evidence that LRMs pre-plan the reasoning strengths in their activations even before generation, with this reasoning strength causally controlled by the magnitude of a pre-allocated directional vector. Specifically, we show that the number of reasoning tokens is predictable solely based on the question activations using linear probes, indicating that LRMs estimate the required reasoning strength in advance. We then uncover that LRMs encode this reasoning strength through a pre-allocated directional vector embedded in the activations of the model, where the vector's magnitude modulates the reasoning strength. Subtracting this vector can lead to reduced reasoning token number and performance, while adding this vector can lead to increased reasoning token number and even improved performance. We further reveal that this direction vector consistently yields positive reasoning length prediction, and it modifies the logits of end-of-reasoning token  to affect the reasoning length. Finally, we demonstrate two potential applications of our findings: overthinking behavior detection and enabling efficient reasoning on simple problems. Our work provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of reasoning in LRMs and offers practical tools for controlling their reasoning behaviors.

SafeCoT is a new framework designed to enhance the safety and appropriateness of responses from vision-language models (VLMs) particularly in high-risk or ambiguous situations. This lightweight and interpretable framework leverages rule-based chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision to improve refusal behavior in VLMs. Unlike previous methods that require large-scale safety annotations or complex modeling, SafeCoT uses minimal supervision to help VLMs reason about safety risks and make informed refusals based on context. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrate that SafeCoT effectively reduces overrefusal and improves generalization capabilities, even with limited training data. This approach provides a scalable solution for ensuring that VLMs align with safety-critical objectives. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

<div> Keywords: Graph recommendation systems, shilling attack, backdoor attack, fake nodes, target items

Summary: 
Graph recommendation systems are susceptible to shilling attacks where fake nodes and edges are inserted to manipulate recommendations. This study introduces a novel backdoor attack method that aims to increase the exposure of specific items to a target user while minimizing impact on unrelated nodes. By using a single-node trigger generator, multiple target items can be effectively exposed with just one fake user node. Constraints between target and irrelevant nodes help reduce performance impact. Experimental results show that the exposure of target items to target users is significantly increased, with minimal impact on system performance. This method provides a covert way to influence recommendations without the need for a large number of fake nodes, addressing the challenges of low stealth and high destructiveness typically associated with shilling attacks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.08401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph recommendation systems have been widely studied due to their ability to effectively capture the complex interactions between users and items. However, these systems also exhibit certain vulnerabilities when faced with attacks. The prevailing shilling attack methods typically manipulate recommendation results by injecting a large number of fake nodes and edges. However, such attack strategies face two primary challenges: low stealth and high destructiveness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph backdoor attack method that aims to enhance the exposure of target items to the target user in a covert manner, without affecting other unrelated nodes. Specifically, we design a single-node trigger generator, which can effectively expose multiple target items to the target user by inserting only one fake user node. Additionally, we introduce constraint conditions between the target nodes and irrelevant nodes to mitigate the impact of fake nodes on the recommendation system's performance. Experimental results show that the exposure of the target items reaches no less than 50% in 99% of the target users, while the impact on the recommendation system's performance is controlled within approximately 5%.

<div> taxonomy alignment, large language models, expert calibration, iterative prompt optimization, concept essentiality

Summary:
Combining large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and iterative prompt optimization, this framework automates taxonomy alignment more efficiently than traditional manual methods. By integrating expert-labeled examples and human validation, the framework guides LLMs in generating taxonomy linkages and supporting rationales. In a domain-specific mapping task on concept essentiality, the framework achieved an F1-score of 0.97, surpassing the human benchmark of 0.68. This approach enables scaling of taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings and expert oversight for ambiguous cases. <div>

Abstract: Having a unified, coherent taxonomy is essential for effective knowledge representation in domain-specific applications as diverse terminologies need to be mapped to underlying concepts. Traditional manual approaches to taxonomy alignment rely on expert review of concept pairs, but this becomes prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at scale, while subjective interpretations often lead to expert disagreements. Existing automated methods for taxonomy alignment have shown promise but face limitations in handling nuanced semantic relationships and maintaining consistency across different domains. These approaches often struggle with context-dependent concept mappings and lack transparent reasoning processes. We propose a novel framework that combines large language models (LLMs) with expert calibration and iterative prompt optimization to automate taxonomy alignment. Our method integrates expert-labeled examples, multi-stage prompt engineering, and human validation to guide LLMs in generating both taxonomy linkages and supporting rationales. In evaluating our framework on a domain-specific mapping task of concept essentiality, we achieved an F1-score of 0.97, substantially exceeding the human benchmark of 0.68. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in scaling taxonomy alignment while maintaining high-quality mappings and preserving expert oversight for ambiguous cases.

<div> sparse, hierarchy, deep learning, VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem), Multi-Task

Summary:
The research introduces a novel model, SHIELD, for the Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP setting. The model leverages sparsity and hierarchy principles to address real-world customer distributions in routing problems. By incorporating the Mixture-of-Depths technique, the model can dynamically select nodes to use or skip each decoder layer, improving efficiency and generalization. A context-based clustering layer is developed to exploit hierarchical structures in the problems, producing better local representations. These designs bias the network to identify key features common across tasks and distributions, leading to improved generalization on unseen ones. Empirical results show the superiority of SHIELD over existing methods on 9 real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances toward foundation models for routing problems have shown great potential of a unified deep model for various VRP variants. However, they overlook the complex real-world customer distributions. In this work, we advance the Multi-Task VRP (MTVRP) setting to the more realistic yet challenging Multi-Task Multi-Distribution VRP (MTMDVRP) setting, and introduce SHIELD, a novel model that leverages both sparsity and hierarchy principles. Building on a deeper decoder architecture, we first incorporate the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) technique to enforce sparsity. This improves both efficiency and generalization by allowing the model to dynamically select nodes to use or skip each decoder layer, providing the needed capacity to adaptively allocate computation for learning the task/distribution specific and shared representations. We also develop a context-based clustering layer that exploits the presence of hierarchical structures in the problems to produce better local representations. These two designs inductively bias the network to identify key features that are common across tasks and distributions, leading to significantly improved generalization on unseen ones. Our empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods on 9 real-world maps with 16 VRP variants each.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning has long represented one of the most fundamental and challenging frontiers in artificial intelligence research. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in this area. This survey examines the development of mathematical reasoning abilities in LLMs through two high-level cognitive phases: comprehension, where models gain mathematical understanding via diverse pretraining strategies, and answer generation, which has progressed from direct prediction to step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. We review methods for enhancing mathematical reasoning, ranging from training-free prompting to fine-tuning approaches such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, and discuss recent work on extended CoT and "test-time scaling". Despite notable progress, fundamental challenges remain in terms of capacity, efficiency, and generalization. To address these issues, we highlight promising research directions, including advanced pretraining and knowledge augmentation techniques, formal reasoning frameworks, and meta-generalization through principled learning paradigms. This survey tries to provide some insights for researchers interested in enhancing reasoning capabilities of LLMs and for those seeking to apply these techniques to other domains.

Summary: 
The article introduces the CIPHER framework, a vision-language-action model designed for industrial control tasks. This framework aims to replicate human-like reasoning in industrial settings, particularly in a commercial-grade 3D printer. CIPHER integrates a process expert and a regression model for quantitative characterization of system states, allowing for precise engineering tasks. It also utilizes retrieval-augmented generation to access external expert knowledge, supporting physics-informed reasoning. The hybrid architecture of CIPHER demonstrates strong generalization to diverse tasks without requiring explicit annotations. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process monitoring, explains decisions, and autonomously generates machine instructions. This approach enables autonomous systems to act with precision, reason with context, and communicate decisions transparently, ensuring safe and trusted deployment in industrial environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial processes must be robust and adaptable, as environments and tasks are often unpredictable, while operational errors remain costly and difficult to detect. AI-based control systems offer a path forward, yet typically depend on supervised learning with extensive labelled datasets, which limits their ability to generalize across variable and data-scarce industrial settings. Foundation models could enable broader reasoning and knowledge integration, but rarely deliver the quantitative precision demanded by engineering applications. Here, we introduceControl and Interpretation of Production via Hybrid Expertise and Reasoning (CIPHER): a vision-language-action (VLA) model framework aiming to replicate human-like reasoning for industrial control, instantiated in a commercial-grade 3D printer. It integrates a process expert, a regression model enabling quantitative characterization of system states required for engineering tasks. CIPHER also incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to access external expert knowledge and support physics-informed, chain-of-thought reasoning. This hybrid architecture exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution tasks. It interprets visual or textual inputs from process monitoring, explains its decisions, and autonomously generates precise machine instructions, without requiring explicit annotations. CIPHER thus lays the foundations for autonomous systems that act with precision, reason with context, and communicate decisions transparently, supporting safe and trusted deployment in industrial settings.

Summary:
The article introduces the Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin) framework, designed for building and governing AI-powered digital twins in healthcare. It addresses concerns like hallucination, bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse in consumer health contexts. RHealthTwin utilizes a Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE) to structure inputs for a health-focused language model, ensuring safe, relevant, and explainable responses. The RPE dynamically extracts predefined slots to guide the language model and improve contextual awareness, personalization, fairness, reliability, and explainability. Through a feedback loop, the framework adapts over time based on user satisfaction. Evaluated across mental support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching domains, RHealthTwin achieves state-of-the-art results and high ethical compliance and instruction-following metrics. This framework sets a foundation for responsible use of large language models in health and well-being applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.08486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created new possibilities for digital twins in healthcare. However, the deployment of such systems in consumer health contexts raises significant concerns related to hallucination, bias, lack of transparency, and ethical misuse. In response to recommendations from health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO), we propose Responsible Health Twin (RHealthTwin), a principled framework for building and governing AI-powered digital twins for well-being assistance. RHealthTwin processes multimodal inputs that guide a health-focused LLM to produce safe, relevant, and explainable responses. At the core of RHealthTwin is the Responsible Prompt Engine (RPE), which addresses the limitations of traditional LLM configuration. Conventionally, users input unstructured prompt and the system instruction to configure the LLM, which increases the risk of hallucination. In contrast, RPE extracts predefined slots dynamically to structure both inputs. This guides the language model to generate responses that are context aware, personalized, fair, reliable, and explainable for well-being assistance. The framework further adapts over time through a feedback loop that updates the prompt structure based on user satisfaction. We evaluate RHealthTwin across four consumer health domains including mental support, symptom triage, nutrition planning, and activity coaching. RPE achieves state-of-the-art results with BLEU = 0.41, ROUGE-L = 0.63, and BERTScore = 0.89 on benchmark datasets. Also, we achieve over 90% in ethical compliance and instruction-following metrics using LLM-as-judge evaluation, outperforming baseline strategies. We envision RHealthTwin as a forward-looking foundation for responsible LLM-based applications in health and well-being.

Summary:<br />
FedTAIL is a federated domain generalization framework that addresses challenges such as long-tailed class distributions and conflicting optimization objectives. It incorporates a gradient coherence regularizer to ensure stable convergence by mitigating conflicts between classification and adversarial objectives. The method performs class-wise sharpness minimization and utilizes a curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme to emphasize underrepresented tail classes, improving performance under class imbalance. FedTAIL also enhances conditional distribution alignment through sharpness-aware perturbations in entropy regularization, making it more robust to domain shifts. The framework, compatible with federated learning, achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard domain generalization benchmarks, particularly excelling in scenarios with domain shifts and label imbalance. The effectiveness of FedTAIL is validated in both centralized and federated settings. <div>

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) seeks to train models that perform reliably on unseen target domains without access to target data during training. While recent progress in smoothing the loss landscape has improved generalization, existing methods often falter under long-tailed class distributions and conflicting optimization objectives. We introduce FedTAIL, a federated domain generalization framework that explicitly addresses these challenges through sharpness-guided, gradient-aligned optimization. Our method incorporates a gradient coherence regularizer to mitigate conflicts between classification and adversarial objectives, leading to more stable convergence. To combat class imbalance, we perform class-wise sharpness minimization and propose a curvature-aware dynamic weighting scheme that adaptively emphasizes underrepresented tail classes. Furthermore, we enhance conditional distribution alignment by integrating sharpness-aware perturbations into entropy regularization, improving robustness under domain shift. FedTAIL unifies optimization harmonization, class-aware regularization, and conditional alignment into a scalable, federated-compatible framework. Extensive evaluations across standard domain generalization benchmarks demonstrate that FedTAIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in the presence of domain shifts and label imbalance, validating its effectiveness in both centralized and federated settings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of the low-altitude economy has driven the widespread adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). This growing deployment presents new challenges for UAV trajectory planning in complex urban environments. However, existing studies often overlook key factors, such as urban airspace constraints and economic efficiency, which are essential in low-altitude economy contexts. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is regarded as a promising solution to these issues, while its practical adoption remains limited by low learning efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel UAV trajectory planning framework that combines DRL with large language model (LLM) reasoning to enable safe, compliant, and economically viable path planning. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across multiple metrics, including data collection rate, collision avoidance, successful landing, regulatory compliance, and energy efficiency. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach in addressing UAV trajectory planning key challenges under constraints of the low-altitude economy networking.

<div> Hierarchical graph Transformer, Colonel Blotto game, resource allocation, adversarial environment, policy generation<br />
<br />
Summary: The paper introduces HGformer, a hierarchical graph Transformer framework for the two-stage Colonel Blotto game. It addresses challenges in optimal strategy generation by enhancing the graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model. The proposed layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm utilizes long-term returns from lower-level decisions to optimize higher-level strategy, facilitating coordination between decision-making stages. Experimental results demonstrate that HGformer outperforms existing methods in resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2506.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-stage Colonel Blotto game represents a typical adversarial resource allocation problem, in which two opposing agents sequentially allocate resources in a network topology across two phases: an initial resource deployment followed by multiple rounds of dynamic reallocation adjustments. The sequential dependency between game stages and the complex constraints imposed by the graph topology make it difficult for traditional approaches to attain a globally optimal strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical graph Transformer framework called HGformer. By incorporating an enhanced graph Transformer encoder with structural biases and a two-agent hierarchical decision model, our approach enables efficient policy generation in large-scale adversarial environments. Moreover, we design a layer-by-layer feedback reinforcement learning algorithm that feeds the long-term returns from lower-level decisions back into the optimization of the higher-level strategy, thus bridging the coordination gap between the two decision-making stages. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing hierarchical decision-making or graph neural network methods, HGformer significantly improves resource allocation efficiency and adversarial payoff, achieving superior overall performance in complex dynamic game scenarios.

<br />
Summary: 
Conformance checking in process mining assesses how closely observed process executions adhere to a normative process model. Traditional approaches compute alignments by exploring the state space of the process model and trace, often resulting in state space explosion. This paper introduces FoldA, a novel technique for computing partial-order alignments using directed Petri net unfoldings. Evaluations on synthetic model-log pairs and real-life datasets show that FoldA reduces queued states and better captures concurrency compared to existing alignment methods like Astar and Dijkstra. While FoldA may require more computation time, it offers a more accurate representation of concurrent behavior in real-world processes. <div>
arXiv:2506.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conformance checking is a fundamental task of process mining, which quantifies the extent to which the observed process executions match a normative process model. The state-of-the-art approaches compute alignments by exploring the state space formed by the synchronous product of the process model and the trace. This often leads to state space explosion, particularly when the model exhibits a high degree of choice and concurrency. Moreover, as alignments inherently impose a sequential structure, they fail to fully represent the concurrent behavior present in many real-world processes. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new technique for computing partial-order alignments {on the fly using directed Petri net unfoldings, named FoldA. We evaluate our technique on 485 synthetic model-log pairs and compare it against Astar- and Dijkstra-alignments on 13 real-life model-log pairs and 6 benchmark pairs. The results show that our unfolding alignment, although it requires more computation time, generally reduces the number of queued states and provides a more accurate representation of concurrency.

Summary:
A new study introduces a universal controller for robots of any morphology, enhancing computational and data efficiency. By incorporating contextual information and leveraging modular structure in deep reinforcement learning agents, progress is made in multi-robot control. While generalizing to new and unseen robots poses a challenge, the study hypothesizes that relevant contextual information, though partially observable, can be inferred through interactions. Through the implementation of a modular recurrent architecture, the study evaluates its generalization performance on a variety of MuJoCo robots. The results demonstrate significantly improved performance on robots with unfamiliar dynamics, kinematics, and topologies across multiple environments. This approach highlights the potential for enhanced robot control by incorporating contextual information and modular architecture in deep reinforcement learning agents.

arXiv:2506.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal controller for any robot morphology would greatly improve computational and data efficiency. By utilizing contextual information about the properties of individual robots and exploiting their modular structure in the architecture of deep reinforcement learning agents, steps have been made towards multi-robot control. Generalization to new, unseen robots, however, remains a challenge. In this paper we hypothesize that the relevant contextual information is partially observable, but that it can be inferred through interactions for better generalization to contexts that are not seen during training. To this extent, we implement a modular recurrent architecture and evaluate its generalization performance on a large set of MuJoCo robots. The results show a substantial improved performance on robots with unseen dynamics, kinematics, and topologies, in four different environments.

Summary:
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown potential in complex reasoning tasks but often requires external supervision. This work introduces a self-rewarding RL framework for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning. The framework, called CoVo, leverages the consistency of intermediate reasoning states across different trajectories. CoVo integrates Consistency and Volatility to provide intrinsic rewards for the model, promoting effective learning without external supervision. It also includes a curiosity bonus to encourage diverse exploration. Experimental results on various reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CoVo achieves comparable or superior performance to supervised RL methods. Overall, CoVo offers a scalable approach for LLMs to learn reasoning autonomously. The code for CoVo is available on GitHub at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

arXiv:2506.08745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances of Reinforcement Learning (RL) have highlighted its potential in complex reasoning tasks, yet effective training often relies on external supervision, which limits the broader applicability. In this work, we propose a novel self-rewarding reinforcement learning framework to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning by leveraging the consistency of intermediate reasoning states across different reasoning trajectories. Our key insight is that correct responses often exhibit consistent trajectory patterns in terms of model likelihood: their intermediate reasoning states tend to converge toward their own final answers (high consistency) with minimal deviation toward other candidates (low volatility). Inspired by this observation, we introduce CoVo, an intrinsic reward mechanism that integrates Consistency and Volatility via a robust vector-space aggregation strategy, complemented by a curiosity bonus to promote diverse exploration. CoVo enables LLMs to perform RL in a self-rewarding manner, offering a scalable pathway for learning to reason without external supervision. Extensive experiments on diverse reasoning benchmarks show that CoVo achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing supervised RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sastpg/CoVo.

Summary:<br />
The paper addresses the issue of applying Conditional Independence (CI) tests directly to discretized data, which can lead to incorrect conclusions. Recent advancements have attempted to infer CI relationships between latent variables by binarizing observed data but this results in a loss of information. The proposed method introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the binarization process. By addressing an over-identifying restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), the independence relationships of latent continuous variables can be established. A test statistic is derived, and its asymptotic distribution correctly reflects CI, leveraging nodewise regression. Theoretical findings and empirical results on various datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed test. The code implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, interested variables are often represented as discretized values due to measurement limitations. Applying Conditional Independence (CI) tests directly to such discretized data, however, can lead to incorrect conclusions. To address this, recent advancements have sought to infer the correct CI relationship between the latent variables through binarizing observed data. However, this process inevitably results in a loss of information, which degrades the test's performance. Motivated by this, this paper introduces a sample-efficient CI test that does not rely on the binarization process. We find that the independence relationships of latent continuous variables can be established by addressing an over-identifying restriction problem with Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Based on this insight, we derive an appropriate test statistic and establish its asymptotic distribution correctly reflecting CI by leveraging nodewise regression. Theoretical findings and Empirical results across various datasets demonstrate that the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed test.

This article introduces a novel approach that combines Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery. By identifying informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and refining their selection using Learning-to-Rank models, this method improves the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring causal relationships.

Abstract: Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs is crucial for understanding multivariate interactions in complex systems. Knowledge-based causal discovery -- which involves inferring causal relationships by reasoning over the metadata of variables (e.g., names or textual context) -- offers a compelling alternative to traditional methods that rely on observational data. However, existing methods using Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce unstable and inconsistent results, compromising their reliability for causal inference. To address this, we introduce a novel approach that integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with LLMs to enhance knowledge-based causal discovery. Our approach identifies informative metapath-based subgraphs within KGs and further refines the selection of these subgraphs using Learning-to-Rank-based models. The top-ranked subgraphs are then incorporated into zero-shot prompts, improving the effectiveness of LLMs in inferring the causal relationship. Extensive experiments on biomedical and open-domain datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most baselines by up to 44.4 points in F1 scores, evaluated across diverse LLMs and KGs.

Summary: 
The article discusses the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) as assistants and agents for data science. It highlights the current focus on goal-oriented activities, overlooking data management and exploratory tasks. The research also points out a trend towards either pure assistance or full autonomy, with limited consideration for intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration. Another key finding is the predominant emphasis on human substitution, failing to explore the potential for higher levels of automation through task transformation. Overall, the study underscores the need for a more comprehensive evaluation framework that encompasses a wider range of data science activities and explores different levels of human-AI interaction to maximize the benefits of LLM assistants and agents in data science applications.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as assistants for data science, by suggesting ideas, techniques and small code snippets, or for the interpretation of results and reporting. Proper automation of some data-science activities is now promised by the rise of LLM agents, i.e., AI systems powered by an LLM equipped with additional affordances--such as code execution and knowledge bases--that can perform self-directed actions and interact with digital environments. In this paper, we survey the evaluation of LLM assistants and agents for data science. We find (1) a dominant focus on a small subset of goal-oriented activities, largely ignoring data management and exploratory activities; (2) a concentration on pure assistance or fully autonomous agents, without considering intermediate levels of human-AI collaboration; and (3) an emphasis on human substitution, therefore neglecting the possibility of higher levels of automation thanks to task transformation.

EEG assessment and NLP analysis were used to study the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants in LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only groups completed three sessions, with LLM users showing the weakest brain connectivity. Cognitive activity decreased with external tool use, and LLM users struggled with accurate quoting. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed under-engagement, while Brain-to-LLM users improved memory recall. Self-reported ownership of essays was lowest in the LLM group. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed, raising concerns about long-term educational implications and highlighting the need for further research into AI's role in learning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

- The article introduces a novel framework called POCCO for solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs).
- POCCO enables adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, improving exploration of the solution space.
- The framework uses a conditional computation block to route subproblems to specialized neural architectures.

Abstract: Recent deep reinforcement learning methods have achieved remarkable success in solving multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs) by decomposing them into multiple subproblems, each associated with a specific weight vector. However, these methods typically treat all subproblems equally and solve them using a single model, hindering the effective exploration of the solution space and thus leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome the limitation, we propose POCCO, a novel plug-and-play framework that enables adaptive selection of model structures for subproblems, which are subsequently optimized based on preference signals rather than explicit reward values. Specifically, we design a conditional computation block that routes subproblems to specialized neural architectures. Moreover, we propose a preference-driven optimization algorithm that learns pairwise preferences between winning and losing solutions. We evaluate the efficacy and versatility of POCCO by applying it to two state-of-the-art neural methods for MOCOPs. Experimental results across four classic MOCOP benchmarks demonstrate its significant superiority and strong generalization.

<br />
Summary:
This study focuses on improving traffic simulators by creating a data-driven model that mimics real-world driving behavior at intersections. Intersections are critical for road safety and operational efficiency. The study proposes using deep generative modeling for trajectory prediction to capture the dynamics of vehicles at intersections and evaluates the models on traffic engineering metrics. A multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model is introduced, incorporating signal information and outperforming previous models. The study also introduces traffic engineering-related metrics to evaluate the generative trajectory prediction models and provides a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline for testing them in a live micro-simulation scenario. <div>
arXiv:2506.08957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28% of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they are not tested in a "live" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation metrics.

Summary:
- Traffic intersections play a crucial role in urban road networks by controlling the movement of vehicles.
- Deep generative models can enhance the understanding of traffic efficiency and safety at signalized intersections.
- Current model evaluations focus on trajectory reconstruction errors and lack real-time microsimulation assessment.

Abstract: Traffic Intersections are vital to urban road networks as they regulate the movement of people and goods. However, they are regions of conflicting trajectories and are prone to accidents. Deep Generative models of traffic dynamics at signalized intersections can greatly help traffic authorities better understand the efficiency and safety aspects. At present, models are evaluated on computational metrics that primarily look at trajectory reconstruction errors. They are not evaluated online in a `live' microsimulation scenario. Further, these metrics do not adequately consider traffic engineering-specific concerns such as red-light violations, unallowed stoppage, etc. In this work, we provide a comprehensive analytics tool to train, run, and evaluate models with metrics that give better insights into model performance from a traffic engineering point of view. We train a state-of-the-art multi-vehicle trajectory forecasting model on a large dataset collected by running a calibrated scenario of a real-world urban intersection. We then evaluate the performance of the prediction models, online in a microsimulator, under unseen traffic conditions. We show that despite using ideally-behaved trajectories as input, and achieving low trajectory reconstruction errors, the generated trajectories show behaviors that break traffic rules. We introduce new metrics to evaluate such undesired behaviors and present our results.

Abstract: N-ary Knowledge Graphs (NKGs) are a specialized type of knowledge graph designed to efficiently represent complex real-world facts. Unlike traditional knowledge graphs, where a fact typically involves two entities, NKGs can capture n-ary facts containing more than two entities. Link prediction in NKGs aims to predict missing elements within these n-ary facts, which is essential for completing NKGs and improving the performance of downstream applications. This task has recently gained significant attention. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive survey of link prediction in NKGs, providing an overview of the field, systematically categorizing existing methods, and analyzing their performance and application scenarios. We also outline promising directions for future research.

<div> abstention, Large Language Models, uncertainty, evaluation framework, reliability <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces AbstentionBench, a benchmark for evaluating abstention in Large Language Models (LLMs) across various datasets. It highlights the importance of knowing when not to answer in real-world scenarios where queries may be underspecified or unanswerable. Despite the impressive results of reasoning LLMs in problem-solving, abstention remains an unsolved issue. Surprisingly, fine-tuning reasoning models actually degrades abstention performance. The study also reveals that system prompts can enhance abstention rates, but they do not address the fundamental challenge of LLMs in reasoning about uncertainty. The findings underscore the need for further research to enhance the reliability of LLMs, especially in situations where abstention is crucial. AbstentionBench is released to facilitate future advancements in this area. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliably deployed in both everyday and high-stakes domains, knowing when not to answer is equally critical as answering correctly. Real-world user queries, which can be underspecified, ill-posed, or fundamentally unanswerable, require LLMs to reason about uncertainty and selectively abstain -- i.e., refuse to answer definitively. However, abstention remains understudied, without a systematic evaluation framework for modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce AbstentionBench, a large-scale benchmark for holistically evaluating abstention across 20 diverse datasets, including questions with unknown answers, underspecification, false premises, subjective interpretations, and outdated information. Evaluating 20 frontier LLMs reveals abstention is an unsolved problem, and one where scaling models is of little use. While recent reasoning LLMs have shown impressive results in complex problem solving, surprisingly, we find that reasoning fine-tuning degrades abstention (by $24\%$ on average), even for math and science domains on which reasoning models are explicitly trained. We find that while a carefully crafted system prompt can boost abstention in practice, it does not resolve models' fundamental inability to reason about uncertainty. We release AbstentionBench to foster research into advancing LLM reliability.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple embodied agents in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence, requiring both perception-driven reasoning and scalable cooperation strategies. While recent works have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for multi-agent planning, a few have begun to explore vision-language models (VLMs) for visual reasoning. However, these VLM-based approaches remain limited in their support for diverse embodiment types. In this work, we introduce VIKI-Bench, the first hierarchical benchmark tailored for embodied multi-agent cooperation, featuring three structured levels: agent activation, task planning, and trajectory perception. VIKI-Bench includes diverse robot embodiments, multi-view visual observations, and structured supervision signals to evaluate reasoning grounded in visual inputs. To demonstrate the utility of VIKI-Bench, we propose VIKI-R, a two-stage framework that fine-tunes a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) using Chain-of-Thought annotated demonstrations, followed by reinforcement learning under multi-level reward signals. Our extensive experiments show that VIKI-R significantly outperforms baselines method across all task levels. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement learning enables the emergence of compositional cooperation patterns among heterogeneous agents. Together, VIKI-Bench and VIKI-R offer a unified testbed and method for advancing multi-agent, visual-driven cooperation in embodied AI systems.

Summary:
The article introduces ALE-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI systems on hard optimization problems in algorithm engineering. These problems, drawn from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, are computationally challenging and lack exact solutions. Unlike traditional coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench focuses on iterative solution refinement over extended time periods. The software framework supports interactive agent architectures that use feedback and visualizations to enhance performance. Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs showed high performance on specific problems but revealed a significant gap compared to human consistency and long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This emphasizes the need for benchmarks like ALE-Bench to drive future advancements in AI technology.

Abstract: How well do AI systems perform in algorithm engineering for hard optimization problems in domains such as package-delivery routing, crew scheduling, factory production planning, and power-grid balancing? We introduce ALE-Bench, a new benchmark for evaluating AI systems on score-based algorithmic programming contests. Drawing on real tasks from the AtCoder Heuristic Contests, ALE-Bench presents optimization problems that are computationally hard and admit no known exact solution. Unlike short-duration, pass/fail coding benchmarks, ALE-Bench encourages iterative solution refinement over long time horizons. Our software framework supports interactive agent architectures that leverage test-run feedback and visualizations. Our evaluation of frontier LLMs revealed that while they demonstrate high performance on specific problems, a notable gap remains compared to humans in terms of consistency across problems and long-horizon problem-solving capabilities. This highlights the need for this benchmark to foster future AI advancements.

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3 models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS) models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

Summary:
Exp4Fuse introduces a novel fusion ranking framework that leverages zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to enhance sparse retrievers. By simultaneously considering the original query and an LLM-augmented query, Exp4Fuse generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrated that Exp4Fuse outperforms existing LLM-based query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art results when combined with advanced sparse retrievers. This highlights the effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse retrieval. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in generating hypothetical documents for query expansion, thereby enhancing information retrieval performance. However, the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on the quality of the generated documents, which often requires complex prompt strategies and the integration of advanced dense retrieval techniques. This can be both costly and computationally intensive. To mitigate these limitations, we explore the use of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion to improve sparse retrieval, particularly for learned sparse retrievers. We introduce a novel fusion ranking framework, Exp4Fuse, which enhances the performance of sparse retrievers through an indirect application of zero-shot LLM-based query expansion. Exp4Fuse operates by simultaneously considering two retrieval routes-one based on the original query and the other on the LLM-augmented query. It then generates two ranked lists using a sparse retriever and fuses them using a modified reciprocal rank fusion method. We conduct extensive evaluations of Exp4Fuse against leading LLM-based query expansion methods and advanced retrieval techniques on three MS MARCO-related datasets and seven low-resource datasets. Experimental results reveal that Exp4Fuse not only surpasses existing LLM-based query expansion methods in enhancing sparse retrievers but also, when combined with advanced sparse retrievers, achieves SOTA results on several benchmarks. This highlights the superior performance and effectiveness of Exp4Fuse in improving query expansion for sparse retrieval.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge Distillation, Language Models, Curriculum Learning, Progressive Overload, Stability<br />

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel plug-in curriculum learning framework called Progressive Overload (POCL) to improve Knowledge Distillation (KD) for large language models (LLMs). Current KD methods for LLMs often face issues such as catastrophic forgetting and mode collapse. The POCL framework includes a difficulty measurer and a training scheduler that gradually introduces subsets of training samples with increasing difficulty levels into the distillation process. By starting with easier samples and progressively increasing difficulty, POCL enhances the stability and efficiency of learning for distilled student models. Extensive experiments in instruction-following settings show that POCL consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across various white-box KD methods and model families. The use of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs proves to be effective, demonstrating how structuring training data within the KD process can enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) compresses large language models (LLMs) by transferring the teacher model's capabilities to a smaller student model, reducing inference cost and memory usage while maintaining performance. However, existing KD methods for LLMs often fail to prevent significant shifts in the student model's distribution during training, leading to issues such as catastrophic forgetting, mode collapse, and training-inference mismatch. To address these challenges, we propose a novel, plug-in curriculum learning framework inspired by the strength training principle of "progressive overload" (POCL), which can be seamlessly integrated into existing white-box KD approaches with minimal computational overhead. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a difficulty measurer that ranks and partitions training samples from easy to hard, and (2) a training scheduler that incrementally introduces these subsets into the distillation process at fixed intervals while applying loss functions with progressively rising temperatures. By starting with the easiest samples and progressively increasing the difficulty, the approach enhances both the stability and efficiency of learning. Extensive experiments in instruction-following settings demonstrate that POCL consistently improves the performance of distilled student models across various white-box KD methods and model families. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of sorted training samples in KD for LLMs. More generally, our work demonstrates how to structure training data within the KD process to enhance the stability and performance of distilled LLMs.

Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, energy calculations, and vibrational analysis using various methods. Smaller language models perform well on simple tasks, while more complex tasks benefit from larger models. By decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework, smaller models can match or exceed the performance of larger models in specific scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Atomistic simulations are essential tools in chemistry and materials science, accelerating the discovery of novel catalysts, energy storage materials, and pharmaceuticals. However, running these simulations remains challenging due to the wide range of computational methods, diverse software ecosystems, and the need for expert knowledge and manual effort for the setup, execution, and validation stages. In this work, we present ChemGraph, an agentic framework powered by artificial intelligence and state-of-the-art simulation tools to streamline and automate computational chemistry and materials science workflows. ChemGraph leverages graph neural network-based foundation models for accurate yet computationally efficient calculations and large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding, task planning, and scientific reasoning to provide an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can perform tasks such as molecular structure generation, single-point energy, geometry optimization, vibrational analysis, and thermochemistry calculations with methods ranging from tight-binding and machine learning interatomic potentials to density functional theory or wave function theory-based methods. We evaluate ChemGraph across 13 benchmark tasks and demonstrate that smaller LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, Claude-3.5-haiku, Qwen2.5-14B) perform well on simple workflows, while more complex tasks benefit from using larger models like GPT-4o. Importantly, we show that decomposing complex tasks into smaller subtasks through a multi-agent framework enables smaller LLM models to match or exceed GPT-4o's performance in specific scenarios.

<div> SQL queries, Query rewrite, Large Language Models, QUITE, rewrite strategies<br />
<br />
Summary: QUITE is a new approach that utilizes Large Language Models to rewrite SQL queries with improved efficiency. Existing rule-based methods face challenges in discovering new rules, generalizing to new query patterns, and expressing certain rewrite techniques. QUITE addresses these limitations by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. It employs a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine to enhance rewrite processes, a middleware to generate optimized query equivalents, and a hint injection technique to improve execution plans. Experimental results show that QUITE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, reducing query execution time by up to 35.8% and producing 24.1% more rewrites. It covers a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies that previous systems could not handle. <div>
arXiv:2506.07675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query rewrite transforms SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms that run more efficiently. Existing approaches mainly rely on predefined rewrite rules, but they handle a limited subset of queries and can cause performance regressions. This limitation stems from three challenges of rule-based query rewrite: (1) it is hard to discover and verify new rules, (2) fixed rewrite rules do not generalize to new query patterns, and (3) some rewrite techniques cannot be expressed as fixed rules. Motivated by the fact that human experts exhibit significantly better rewrite ability but suffer from scalability, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated nearly human-level semantic and reasoning abilities, we propose a new approach of using LLMs to rewrite SQL queries beyond rules. Due to the hallucination problems in LLMs, directly applying LLMs often leads to nonequivalent and suboptimal queries. To address this issue, we propose QUITE (query rewrite), a training-free and feedback-aware system based on LLM agents that rewrites SQL queries into semantically equivalent forms with significantly better performance, covering a broader range of query patterns and rewrite strategies compared to rule-based methods. Firstly, we design a multi-agent framework controlled by a finite state machine (FSM) to equip LLMs with the ability to use external tools and enhance the rewrite process with real-time database feedback. Secondly, we develop a rewrite middleware to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate optimized query equivalents. Finally, we employ a novel hint injection technique to improve execution plans for rewritten queries. Extensive experiments show that QUITE reduces query execution time by up to 35.8% over state-of-the-art approaches and produces 24.1% more rewrites than prior methods, covering query cases that earlier systems did not handle.

<div> Keywords: Key-Value Cache, Large Language Models, Quantization, Mixed Precision, Dynamic Optimization

Summary:
KVmix is a novel mixed-precision quantization method for Key-Value (KV) Cache in Large Language Models (LLMs) that dynamically prioritizes critical KV pairs. By leveraging gradient-based importance analysis, KVmix achieves layer-specific bit-width allocation for efficient quantization. It introduces a dynamic long-context optimization strategy to balance accuracy and efficiency, keeping full-precision KV pairs for recent pivotal tokens while compressing older ones. KVmix also provides low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels for optimized computational overhead. Experimental results on LLMs like Llama and Mistral demonstrate near-lossless inference performance with significant memory compression (4.9x) and speedup in inference throughput (5.3x) using extremely low quantization configurations for Key and Value matrices. Overall, KVmix offers a tunable balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for deploying LLMs on resource-constrained platforms.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The high memory demands of the Key-Value (KV) Cache during the inference of Large Language Models (LLMs) severely restrict their deployment in resource-constrained platforms. Quantization can effectively alleviate the memory pressure caused by KV Cache. However, existing methods either rely on static one-size-fits-all precision allocation or fail to dynamically prioritize critical KV in long-context tasks, forcing memory-accuracy-throughput tradeoffs. In this work, we propose a novel mixed-precision quantization method for KV Cache named KVmix. KVmix leverages gradient-based importance analysis to evaluate how individual Key and Value projection matrices affect the model loss, enabling layer-specific bit-width allocation for mix-precision quantization. It dynamically prioritizes higher precision for important layers while aggressively quantizing less influential ones, achieving a tunable balance between accuracy and efficiency. KVmix also introduces a dynamic long-context optimization strategy that adaptively keeps full-precision KV pairs for recent pivotal tokens and compresses older ones, achieving high-quality sequence generation with low memory usage. Additionally, KVmix provides efficient low-bit quantization and CUDA kernels to optimize computational overhead. On LLMs such as Llama and Mistral, KVmix achieves near-lossless inference performance with extremely low quantization configuration (Key 2.19bit Value 2.38bit), while delivering a remarkable 4.9x memory compression and a 5.3x speedup in inference throughput.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model for Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) to align cross-domain samples while distinguishing outlier classes. Traditional weighting frameworks may be sensitive to inaccurate predictions and lack exploration of cluster structures. The BUOT model addresses these issues by simultaneously considering sample-wise and class-wise relations in a unified transport framework. It introduces a cooperation mechanism between sample-level and class-level transport, providing essential structure information for knowledge transfer and discriminative information for outlier identification. By incorporating label-aware transport costs, the model ensures local transport structure and improves efficiency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show the competitiveness of BUOT in PDA tasks. <div>

Abstract: Partial domain adaptation (PDA) problem requires aligning cross-domain samples while distinguishing the outlier classes for accurate knowledge transfer. The widely used weighting framework tries to address the outlier classes by introducing the reweighed source domain with a similar label distribution to the target domain. However, the empirical modeling of weights can only characterize the sample-wise relations, which leads to insufficient exploration of cluster structures, and the weights could be sensitive to the inaccurate prediction and cause confusion on the outlier classes. To tackle these issues, we propose a Bi-level Unbalanced Optimal Transport (BUOT) model to simultaneously characterize the sample-wise and class-wise relations in a unified transport framework. Specifically, a cooperation mechanism between sample-level and class-level transport is introduced, where the sample-level transport provides essential structure information for the class-level knowledge transfer, while the class-level transport supplies discriminative information for the outlier identification. The bi-level transport plan provides guidance for the alignment process. By incorporating the label-aware transport cost, the local transport structure is ensured and a fast computation formulation is derived to improve the efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the competitiveness of BUOT.

Summary:
Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO) addresses modality imbalance in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by generating hard negatives through adversarial perturbation of input images. It leverages close-ended tasks for online responses with verified rewards and uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train the model with hybrid data. The proposed framework improves LMM performance on vision-language tasks and reduces hallucinations by restraining biases and adapting to dynamic distributional shifts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MBPO in enhancing reasoning capabilities of LMMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: This paper aims to retrieve proteins with similar structures and semantics from large-scale protein dataset, facilitating the functional interpretation of protein structures derived by structural determination methods like cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Motivated by the recent progress of vision-language models (VLMs), we propose a CLIP-style framework for aligning 3D protein structures with functional annotations using contrastive learning.

In both cases, our approach demonstrates promising zero-shot retrieval performance, highlighting the potential of multimodal foundation models for structure-function understanding in protein biology.

<div> Keywords: precision scaling, GPU efficiency, microscaling formats, quantizing tensors, numeric stability

Summary: 
Precision scaling, specifically using microscaling formats on NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs, has shown potential for improving GPU efficiency by representing model parameters with fewer bits during pre-training. These formats utilize narrow floating-point types and block scaling factors for quantizing tensors at a fine-grained level. While microscaling formats offer improved numeric stability, the default rounding mode as per the OCP specification can lead to divergence during pre-training of large language models (LLMs) on immense datasets. The study proposes an alternative rounding mode utilizing round-to-infinity for computing scaling factors, enabling successful pre-training of an 8B model on a dataset of 15 trillion tokens. By careful adjustment of rounding modes, microscaling formats like MXFP8 can help achieve better convergence and accuracy in training LLMs on massive datasets.

Abstract: Precision scaling - using fewer bits to represent model parameters and related tensors during pre-training - has emerged as a compelling technique for improving GPU efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Microscaling (MX) formats in NVIDIA's latest Blackwell GPUs represent a major leap in enabling this precision scaling aspect. These formats combine narrow floating-point data types with per-block scaling factors, offering a fine-grained approach to quantizing tensors.
  Although MX-formats offer the promise of improved numeric stability compared to other reduced-precision representations, in practice they must be used carefully in order to successfully converge an LLM on a multi-trillion token dataset. In this paper, we show that the rounding mode suggested in OCP specification can lead to divergence when pre-training an LLM. We show an improved rounding mode, which uses round-to-infinity to compute scaling factors, enables successful pre-training in MXFP8 for an 8B model on 15T tokens.

Summary:
DCIDA is a design exploration framework for inverse design in distributed circuits. It aims to generate near-optimal designs meeting desired transfer function specifications. The framework uses a Transformer-based policy network to learn a near-optimal design sampling policy for a target transfer function. DCIDA makes compound single-step design decisions by sampling from jointly-trained conditional distributions. It transforms raw design actions into unique physical representations using an injective interdependent map, allowing it to learn conditional dependencies among joint design decisions. Experimental results show that DCIDA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant reductions in design error and better fit for complex transfer functions. <div>

Abstract: The goal of inverse design in distributed circuits is to generate near-optimal designs that meet a desirable transfer function specification. Existing design exploration methods use some combination of strategies involving artificial grids, differentiable evaluation procedures, and specific template topologies. However, real-world design practices often require non-differentiable evaluation procedures, varying topologies, and near-continuous placement spaces. In this paper, we propose DCIDA, a design exploration framework that learns a near-optimal design sampling policy for a target transfer function. DCIDA decides all design factors in a compound single-step action by sampling from a set of jointly-trained conditional distributions generated by the policy. Utilizing an injective interdependent ``map", DCIDA transforms raw sampled design ``actions" into uniquely equivalent physical representations, enabling the framework to learn the conditional dependencies among joint ``raw'' design decisions. Our experiments demonstrate DCIDA's Transformer-based policy network achieves significant reductions in design error compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with significantly better fit in cases involving more complex transfer functions.

Abstract: This work presents a novel course titled The World of AI designed for first-year undergraduate engineering students with little to no prior exposure to AI. The central problem addressed by this course is that engineering students often lack foundational knowledge of AI and its broader societal implications at the outset of their academic journeys. We believe the way to address this gap is to design and deliver an interdisciplinary course that can a) be accessed by first-year undergraduate engineering students across any domain, b) enable them to understand the basic workings of AI systems sans mathematics, and c) make them appreciate AI's far-reaching implications on our lives. The course was divided into three modules co-delivered by faculty from both engineering and humanities. The planetary module explored AI's dual role as both a catalyst for sustainability and a contributor to environmental challenges. The societal impact module focused on AI biases and concerns around privacy and fairness. Lastly, the workplace module highlighted AI-driven job displacement, emphasizing the importance of adaptation. The novelty of this course lies in its interdisciplinary curriculum design and pedagogical approach, which combines technical instruction with societal discourse. Results revealed that students' comprehension of AI challenges improved across diverse metrics like (a) increased awareness of AI's environmental impact, and (b) efficient corrective solutions for AI fairness. Furthermore, it also indicated the evolution in students' perception of AI's transformative impact on our lives.

Abstract: In augmented reality (AR)-guided surgical navigation, preoperative organ models are superimposed onto the patient's intraoperative anatomy to visualize critical structures such as vessels and tumors. Accurate deformation modeling is essential to maintain the reliability of AR overlays by ensuring alignment between preoperative models and the dynamically changing anatomy. Although the finite element method (FEM) offers physically plausible modeling, its high computational cost limits intraoperative applicability. Moreover, existing algorithms often fail to handle large anatomical changes, such as those induced by pneumoperitoneum or ligament dissection, leading to inaccurate anatomical correspondences and compromised AR guidance. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven biomechanics algorithm that preserves FEM-level accuracy while improving computational efficiency. In addition, we introduce a novel human-in-the-loop mechanism into the deformation modeling process. This enables surgeons to interactively provide prompts to correct anatomical misalignments, thereby incorporating clinical expertise and allowing the model to adapt dynamically to complex surgical scenarios. Experiments on a publicly available dataset demonstrate that our algorithm achieves a mean target registration error of 3.42 mm. Incorporating surgeon prompts through the interactive framework further reduces the error to 2.78 mm, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in volumetric accuracy. These results highlight the ability of our framework to deliver efficient and accurate deformation modeling while enhancing surgeon-algorithm collaboration, paving the way for safer and more reliable computer-assisted surgeries.

Abstract: Subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasting, which predicts climate conditions from several weeks to months in advance, presents significant challenges due to the chaotic dynamics of atmospheric systems and complex interactions across multiple scales. Current approaches often fail to explicitly model underlying physical processes and teleconnections that are crucial at S2S timescales. We introduce TelePiT, a novel deep learning architecture that enhances global S2S forecasting through integrated multi-scale physics and teleconnection awareness. Our approach consists of three key components: (1) Spherical Harmonic Embedding, which accurately encodes global atmospheric variables onto spherical geometry; (2) Multi-Scale Physics-Informed Neural ODE, which explicitly captures atmospheric physical processes across multiple learnable frequency bands; (3) Teleconnection-Aware Transformer, which models critical global climate interactions through tactfully injecting teleconnection patterns into the self-attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TelePiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven baselines and operational numerical weather prediction systems, with remarkable improvements for atmospheric variables including a 57.7% reduction in RMSE for 2-meter temperature compared to previous best models.

Abstract: Traffic data imputation is fundamentally important to support various applications in intelligent transportation systems such as traffic flow prediction. However, existing time-to-space sequential methods often fail to effectively extract features in block-wise missing data scenarios. Meanwhile, the static graph structure for spatial feature propagation significantly constrains the models flexibility in handling the distribution shift issue for the nonstationary traffic data. To address these issues, this paper proposes a SpatioTemporal Attention Mixture of experts network named STAMImputer for traffic data imputation. Specifically, we introduce a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework to capture latent spatio-temporal features and their influence weights, effectively imputing block missing. A novel Low-rank guided Sampling Graph ATtention (LrSGAT) mechanism is designed to dynamically balance the local and global correlations across road networks. The sampled attention vectors are utilized to generate dynamic graphs that capture real-time spatial correlations. Extensive experiments are conducted on four traffic datasets for evaluation. The result shows STAMImputer achieves significantly performance improvement compared with existing SOTA approaches. Our codes are available at https://github.com/RingBDStack/STAMImupter.

Abstract: Caco-2 permeability serves as a critical in vitro indicator for predicting the oral absorption of drug candidates during early-stage drug discovery. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of computational predictions, we systematically investigated the impact of eight molecular feature representation types including 2D/3D descriptors, structural fingerprints, and deep learning-based embeddings combined with automated machine learning techniques to predict Caco-2 permeability. Using two datasets of differing scale and diversity (TDC benchmark and curated OCHEM data), we assessed model performance across representations and identified PaDEL, Mordred, and RDKit descriptors as particularly effective for Caco-2 prediction. Notably, the AutoML-based model CaliciBoost achieved the best MAE performance. Furthermore, for both PaDEL and Mordred representations, the incorporation of 3D descriptors resulted in a 15.73% reduction in MAE compared to using 2D features alone, as confirmed by feature importance analysis. These findings highlight the effectiveness of AutoML approaches in ADMET modeling and offer practical guidance for feature selection in data-limited prediction tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have transformed natural language processing, yet supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains computationally intensive. This paper formally proves that capabilities acquired through SFT can be approximated by a base transformer model using inference-time techniques, specifically in-context learning (ICL), without altering model parameters, under idealized assumptions including unbounded computational resources and access to the fine-tuning dataset. We extend these results to practical scenarios with finite context lengths and partial dataset access. For text generation tasks with fixed output length $l$, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{m V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{m}{\delta} \right)$ or, with bounded context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{l \log V}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ suffice to approximate fine-tuned behavior across $m$ contexts within error $\varepsilon$, where $V$ is the vocabulary size and $\delta$ is the failure probability. For linear classification, datasets of size $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{d}{\varepsilon} \right)$ or, with fixed context, $\mathrm{O}\left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \log \frac{1}{\delta} \right)$ are sufficient, where $d$ is the input dimension. Grounded in the Turing completeness of transformers, these results provide a theoretical foundation for resource-efficient deployment of large language models, with practical techniques like retrieval-augmented generation bridging theory to real-world applications.

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize policies in the presence of conflicting objectives, where linear scalarization is commonly used to reduce vector-valued returns into scalar signals. While effective for certain preferences, this approach cannot capture fairness-oriented goals such as Nash social welfare or max-min fairness, which require nonlinear and non-additive trade-offs. Although several online algorithms have been proposed for specific fairness objectives, a unified approach for optimizing nonlinear welfare criteria in the offline setting-where learning must proceed from a fixed dataset-remains unexplored. In this work, we present FairDICE, the first offline MORL framework that directly optimizes nonlinear welfare objective. FairDICE leverages distribution correction estimation to jointly account for welfare maximization and distributional regularization, enabling stable and sample-efficient learning without requiring explicit preference weights or exhaustive weight search. Across multiple offline benchmarks, FairDICE demonstrates strong fairness-aware performance compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models. Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.

Abstract: Machine learning relies heavily on data, yet the continuous growth of real-world data poses challenges for efficient dataset construction and training. A fundamental yet unsolved question is: given our current model and data, does a new data (sample/batch) need annotation/learning? Conventional approaches retain all available data, leading to non-optimal data and training efficiency. Active learning aims to reduce data redundancy by selecting a subset of samples to annotate, while it increases pipeline complexity and introduces bias. In this work, we propose Info-Coevolution, a novel framework that efficiently enables models and data to coevolve through online selective annotation with no bias. Leveraging task-specific models (and open-source models), it selectively annotates and integrates online and web data to improve datasets efficiently. For real-world datasets like ImageNet-1K, Info-Coevolution reduces annotation and training costs by 32\% without performance loss. It is able to automatically give the saving ratio without tuning the ratio. It can further reduce the annotation ratio to 50\% with semi-supervised learning. We also explore retrieval-based dataset enhancement using unlabeled open-source data. Code is available at https://github.com/NUS-HPC-AI-Lab/Info-Coevolution/.

Abstract: Ferroelectric polarization switching underpins the functional performance of a wide range of materials and devices, yet its dependence on complex local microstructural features renders systematic exploration by manual or grid-based spectroscopic measurements impractical. Here, we introduce a multi-objective kernel-learning workflow that infers the microstructural rules governing switching behavior directly from high-resolution imaging data. Applied to automated piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) experiments, our framework efficiently identifies the key relationships between domain-wall configurations and local switching kinetics, revealing how specific wall geometries and defect distributions modulate polarization reversal. Post-experiment analysis projects abstract reward functions, such as switching ease and domain symmetry, onto physically interpretable descriptors including domain configuration and proximity to boundaries. This enables not only high-throughput active learning, but also mechanistic insight into the microstructural control of switching phenomena. While demonstrated for ferroelectric domain switching, our approach provides a powerful, generalizable tool for navigating complex, non-differentiable design spaces, from structure-property correlations in molecular discovery to combinatorial optimization across diverse imaging modalities.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds large language models in external evidence, yet it still falters when answers must be pieced together across semantically distant documents. We close this gap with the Hierarchical Lexical Graph (HLG), a three-tier index that (i) traces every atomic proposition to its source, (ii) clusters propositions into latent topics, and (iii) links entities and relations to expose cross-document paths. On top of HLG we build two complementary, plug-and-play retrievers: StatementGraphRAG, which performs fine-grained entity-aware beam search over propositions for high-precision factoid questions, and TopicGraphRAG, which selects coarse topics before expanding along entity links to supply broad yet relevant context for exploratory queries. Additionally, existing benchmarks lack the complexity required to rigorously evaluate multi-hop summarization systems, often focusing on single-document queries or limited datasets. To address this, we introduce a synthetic dataset generation pipeline that curates realistic, multi-document question-answer pairs, enabling robust evaluation of multi-hop retrieval systems. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that our methods outperform naive chunk-based RAG achieving an average relative improvement of 23.1% in retrieval recall and correctness. Open-source Python library is available at https://github.com/awslabs/graphrag-toolkit.

Abstract: Accurate electricity price forecasting (EPF) is crucial for effective decision-making in power trading on the spot market. While recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have inspired the development of numerous time series foundation models (TSFMs) for time series forecasting, their effectiveness in EPF remains uncertain. To address this gap, we benchmark several state-of-the-art pretrained models--Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-T5, TimesFM, Moirai, Time-MoE, and TimeGPT--against established statistical and machine learning (ML) methods for EPF. Using 2024 day-ahead auction (DAA) electricity prices from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Austria, and Belgium, we generate daily forecasts with a one-day horizon. Chronos-Bolt and Time-MoE emerge as the strongest among the TSFMs, performing on par with traditional models. However, the biseasonal MSTL model, which captures daily and weekly seasonality, stands out for its consistent performance across countries and evaluation metrics, with no TSFM statistically outperforming it.

Abstract: Accurate canal network mapping is essential for water management, including irrigation planning and infrastructure maintenance. State-of-the-art semantic segmentation models for infrastructure mapping, such as roads, rely on large, well-annotated remote sensing datasets. However, incomplete or inadequate ground truth can hinder these learning approaches. Many infrastructure networks have graph-level properties such as reachability to a source (like canals) or connectivity (roads) that can be leveraged to improve these existing ground truth. This paper develops a novel iterative framework IGraSS, combining a semantic segmentation module-incorporating RGB and additional modalities (NDWI, DEM)-with a graph-based ground-truth refinement module. The segmentation module processes satellite imagery patches, while the refinement module operates on the entire data viewing the infrastructure network as a graph. Experiments show that IGraSS reduces unreachable canal segments from around 18% to 3%, and training with refined ground truth significantly improves canal identification. IGraSS serves as a robust framework for both refining noisy ground truth and mapping canal networks from remote sensing imagery. We also demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of IGraSS using road networks as an example, applying a different graph-theoretic constraint to complete road networks.

Abstract: It is common in supervised machine learning to combine the feature extraction capabilities of neural networks with the predictive power of traditional algorithms, such as k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) or support vector machines. This procedure involves performing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a domain-appropriate feature extractor, followed by training a traditional predictor on the resulting SFT embeddings. When used in this manner, traditional predictors often deliver increased performance over the SFT model itself, despite the fine-tuned feature extractor yielding embeddings specifically optimized for prediction by the neural network's final dense layer. This suggests that directly incorporating traditional algorithms into SFT as prediction layers may further improve performance. However, many traditional algorithms have not been implemented as neural network layers due to their non-differentiable nature and their unique optimization requirements. As a step towards solving this problem, we introduce the Nearness of Neighbors Attention (NONA) regression layer. NONA uses the mechanics of neural network attention and a novel learned attention-masking scheme to yield a differentiable proxy of the k-NN regression algorithm. Results on multiple unstructured datasets show improved performance over both dense layer prediction and k-NN on SFT embeddings for regression.

<title>Multilingual Hate Speech Detection in Social Media Using Translation-Based Approaches with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Social media platforms are critical spaces for public discourse, shaping opinions and community dynamics, yet their widespread use has amplified harmful content, particularly hate speech, threatening online safety and inclusivity. While hate speech detection has been extensively studied in languages like English and Spanish, Urdu remains underexplored, especially using translation-based approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a trilingual dataset of 10,193 tweets in English (3,834 samples), Urdu (3,197 samples), and Spanish (3,162 samples), collected via keyword filtering, with a balanced distribution of 4,849 Hateful and 5,344 Not-Hateful labels. Our methodology leverages attention layers as a precursor to transformer-based models and large language models (LLMs), enhancing feature extraction for multilingual hate speech detection. For non-transformer models, we use TF-IDF for feature extraction. The dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art models, including GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, alongside traditional machine learning models like SVM and other transformers (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa). Three annotators, following rigorous guidelines, ensured high dataset quality, achieving a Fleiss' Kappa of 0.821. Our approach, integrating attention layers with GPT-3.5 Turbo and Qwen 2.5 72B, achieves strong performance, with macro F1 scores of 0.87 for English (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.85 for Spanish (GPT-3.5 Turbo), 0.81 for Urdu (Qwen 2.5 72B), and 0.88 for the joint multilingual model (Qwen 2.5 72B). These results reflect improvements of 8.75% in English (over SVM baseline 0.80), 8.97% in Spanish (over SVM baseline 0.78), 5.19% in Urdu (over SVM baseline 0.77), and 7.32% in the joint multilingual model (over SVM baseline 0.82). Our framework offers a robust solution for multilingual hate speech detection, fostering safer digital communities worldwide.

Abstract: We study multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for tasks in complex high-dimensional environments, such as autonomous driving. MARL is known to suffer from the \textit{partial observability} and \textit{non-stationarity} issues. To tackle these challenges, information sharing is often employed, which however faces major hurdles in practice, including overwhelming communication overhead and scalability concerns. By making use of generative AI embodied in world model together with its latent representation, we develop {\it CALL}, \underline{C}ommunic\underline{a}tive Wor\underline{l}d Mode\underline{l}, for MARL, where 1) each agent first learns its world model that encodes its state and intention into low-dimensional latent representation with smaller memory footprint, which can be shared with other agents of interest via lightweight communication; and 2) each agent carries out ego-centric learning while exploiting lightweight information sharing to enrich her world model, and then exploits its generalization capacity to improve prediction for better planning. We characterize the gain on the prediction accuracy from the information sharing and its impact on performance gap. Extensive experiments are carried out on the challenging local trajectory planning tasks in the CARLA platform to demonstrate the performance gains of using \textit{CALL}.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often suffers from severe performance degradation when faced with non-IID data, largely due to local classifier bias. Traditional remedies such as global model regularization or layer freezing either incur high computational costs or struggle to adapt to feature shifts. In this work, we propose UniVarFL, a novel FL framework that emulates IID-like training dynamics directly at the client level, eliminating the need for global model dependency. UniVarFL leverages two complementary regularization strategies during local training: Classifier Variance Regularization, which aligns class-wise probability distributions with those expected under IID conditions, effectively mitigating local classifier bias; and Hyperspherical Uniformity Regularization, which encourages a uniform distribution of feature representations across the hypersphere, thereby enhancing the model's ability to generalize under diverse data distributions. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that UniVarFL outperforms existing methods in accuracy, highlighting its potential as a highly scalable and efficient solution for real-world FL deployments, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of coding tasks, including code generation, completion, and repair. However, more complex symbolic reasoning tasks remain largely unexplored by LLMs. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs to reason about worst-case executions in programs through symbolic constraints analysis, aiming to connect LLMs and symbolic reasoning approaches. Specifically, we define and address the problem of worst-case symbolic constraints analysis as a measure to assess the comprehension of LLMs. We evaluate the performance of existing LLMs on this novel task and further improve their capabilities through symbolic reasoning-guided fine-tuning, grounded in SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) constraint solving and supported by a specially designed dataset of symbolic constraints. Experimental results show that our solver-aligned model, WARP-1.0-3B, consistently surpasses size-matched and even much larger baselines, demonstrating that a 3B LLM can recover the very constraints that pin down an algorithm's worst-case behaviour through reinforcement learning methods. These findings suggest that LLMs are capable of engaging in deeper symbolic reasoning, supporting a closer integration between neural network-based learning and formal methods for rigorous program analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in code generation and comprehension, yet their application to complex software engineering tasks often suffers from low precision and limited interpretability. We present Repeton, a fully open-source framework that leverages LLMs for precise and automated code manipulation in real-world Git repositories. Rather than generating holistic fixes, Repeton operates through a structured patch-and-test pipeline: it iteratively diagnoses issues, proposes code changes, and validates each patch through automated testing. This stepwise process is guided by lightweight heuristics and development tools, avoiding reliance on embedding-based retrieval systems. Evaluated on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark, our method shows good performance compared to RAG-based methods in both patch validity and interpretability. By decomposing software engineering tasks into modular, verifiable stages, Repeton provides a practical path toward scalable and transparent autonomous debugging.

<title>Unable to forget: Proactive lnterference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length</title>

arXiv:2506.08184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.

Abstract: Surgeons exhibit distinct operating styles due to differences in training, experience, and motor behavior - yet current AI systems often ignore this personalization signal. We propose a novel approach to model fine-grained, surgeon-specific fingerprinting in robotic surgery using a discrete diffusion framework integrated with a vision-language-action (VLA) pipeline. Our method formulates gesture prediction as a structured sequence denoising task, conditioned on multimodal inputs including endoscopic video, surgical intent language, and a privacy-aware embedding of surgeon identity and skill. Personalized surgeon fingerprinting is encoded through natural language prompts using third-party language models, allowing the model to retain individual behavioral style without exposing explicit identity. We evaluate our method on the JIGSAWS dataset and demonstrate that it accurately reconstructs gesture sequences while learning meaningful motion fingerprints unique to each surgeon. To quantify the privacy implications of personalization, we perform membership inference attacks and find that more expressive embeddings improve task performance but simultaneously increase susceptibility to identity leakage. These findings demonstrate that while personalized embeddings improve performance, they also increase vulnerability to identity leakage, revealing the importance of balancing personalization with privacy risk in surgical modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/huixin-zhan-ai/Surgeon_style_fingerprinting.

Abstract: Both text-to-image generation and large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements. However, many text-to-image models still employ the somewhat outdated T5 and CLIP as their text encoders. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of using modern decoder-only LLMs as text encoders for text-to-image diffusion models. We build a standardized training and evaluation pipeline that allows us to isolate and evaluate the effect of different text embeddings. We train a total of 27 text-to-image models with 12 different text encoders to analyze the critical aspects of LLMs that could impact text-to-image generation, including the approaches to extract embeddings, different LLMs variants, and model sizes. Our experiments reveal that the de facto way of using last-layer embeddings as conditioning leads to inferior performance. Instead, we explore embeddings from various layers and find that using layer-normalized averaging across all layers significantly improves alignment with complex prompts. Most LLMs with this conditioning outperform the baseline T5 model, showing enhanced performance in advanced visio-linguistic reasoning skills.

Abstract: We study the empirical scaling laws of a family of encoder-decoder autoregressive transformer models on the task of joint motion forecasting and planning in the autonomous driving domain. Using a 500 thousand hours driving dataset, we demonstrate that, similar to language modeling, model performance improves as a power-law function of the total compute budget, and we observe a strong correlation between model training loss and model evaluation metrics. Most interestingly, closed-loop metrics also improve with scaling, which has important implications for the suitability of open-loop metrics for model development and hill climbing. We also study the optimal scaling of the number of transformer parameters and the training data size for a training compute-optimal model. We find that as the training compute budget grows, optimal scaling requires increasing the model size 1.5x as fast as the dataset size. We also study inference-time compute scaling, where we observe that sampling and clustering the output of smaller models makes them competitive with larger models, up to a crossover point beyond which a larger models becomes more inference-compute efficient. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that optimizing the training and inference-time scaling properties of motion forecasting and planning models is a key lever for improving their performance to address a wide variety of driving scenarios. Finally, we briefly study the utility of training on general logged driving data of other agents to improve the performance of the ego-agent, an important research area to address the scarcity of robotics data for large capacity models training.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology. However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups. By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD, this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and AI systems have led to a paradigm shift in the design and optimization of complex AI workflows. By integrating multiple components, compound AI systems have become increasingly adept at performing sophisticated tasks. However, as these systems grow in complexity, new challenges arise in optimizing not only individual components but also their interactions. While traditional optimization methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) remain foundational, the rise of natural language feedback introduces promising new approaches, especially for optimizing non-differentiable systems. This paper provides a systematic review of recent progress in optimizing compound AI systems, encompassing both numerical and language-based techniques. We formalize the notion of compound AI system optimization, classify existing methods along several key dimensions, and highlight open research challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used for complex research tasks such as literature review, idea generation, and scientific paper analysis, yet their ability to truly understand and process the intricate relationships within complex research papers, such as the logical links between claims and supporting evidence remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present CLAIM-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capabilities in scientific claim-evidence extraction and validation, a task that reflects deeper comprehension of scientific argumentation. We systematically compare three approaches which are inspired by divide and conquer approaches, across six diverse LLMs, highlighting model-specific strengths and weaknesses in scientific comprehension. Through evaluation involving over 300 claim-evidence pairs across multiple research domains, we reveal significant limitations in LLMs' ability to process complex scientific content. Our results demonstrate that closed-source models like GPT-4 and Claude consistently outperform open-source counterparts in precision and recall across claim-evidence identification tasks. Furthermore, strategically designed three-pass and one-by-one prompting approaches significantly improve LLMs' abilities to accurately link dispersed evidence with claims, although this comes at increased computational cost. CLAIM-BENCH sets a new standard for evaluating scientific comprehension in LLMs, offering both a diagnostic tool and a path forward for building systems capable of deeper, more reliable reasoning across full-length papers.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks incorporate symmetries through group actions, embedding them as an inductive bias to improve performance on a wide variety of tasks. However, existing equivariant methods can be computationally intensive, with high parameter counts, and are often tied to a specific architecture. We propose a simple zero-parameter approach that imposes approximate equivariance for a finite group in the latent representation, as an additional term in the loss function. We conduct experiments which allow the network to learn a group representation on the latent space, and show in every case it prefers to learn the regular representation. Fixing this action on the latent space, this yields a simple method to impose approximate equivariance as an additional loss penalty. We benchmark our approach on three datasets and compare it against several existing equivariant methods, showing that in many cases it achieves similar or better performance for a fraction of the parameters.

Abstract: Traditional deep neural networks suffer from several limitations, including catastrophic forgetting. When models are adapted to new datasets, they tend to quickly forget previously learned knowledge. Another significant issue is the lack of robustness to even small perturbations in the input data. In practice, we can often easily perform adversarial attacks and change the network's predictions, adding minimal noise to the input. Dedicated architectures and training procedures can solve each of the above problems separately. Unfortunately, currently, no model can simultaneously address both catastrophic forgetting and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We introduce SHIELD (Secure Hypernetworks for Incremental Expansion and Learning Defense), a novel approach that integrates a hypernetwork-based continual learning approach with interval arithmetic. SHIELD use the hypernetwork to transfer trainable task embedding vectors into the weights of a target model dedicated to specific data. This paradigm allows for the dynamic generation of separate networks for each subtask, while the hypernetwork aggregates and analyzes information across all tasks. The target model takes in the input a data sample with a defined interval range, and by creating a hypercube, produces a prediction for the given range. Therefore, such target models provide strict guarantees against all possible attacks for data samples within the interval range. Our approach enhances security without sacrificing network adaptability, addressing the overlooked challenge of safety in continual learning.

Abstract: Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any generative model.

<title>Automatic Generation of Inference Making Questions for Reading Comprehension Assessments</title>

Abstract: Inference making is an essential but complex skill in reading comprehension (RC). Some inferences require resolving references across sentences, and some rely on using prior knowledge to fill in the detail that is not explicitly written in the text. Diagnostic RC questions can help educators provide more effective and targeted reading instruction and interventions for school-age students. We introduce a taxonomy of inference types for RC and use it to analyze the distribution of items within a diagnostic RC item bank. Next, we present experiments using GPT-4o to generate bridging-inference RC items for given reading passages via few-shot prompting, comparing conditions with and without chain-of-thought prompts. Generated items were evaluated on three aspects: overall item quality, appropriate inference type, and LLM reasoning, achieving high inter-rater agreements above 0.90. Our results show that GPT-4o produced 93.8% good-quality questions suitable for operational use in grade 3-12 contexts; however, only 42.6% of the generated questions accurately matched the targeted inference type. We conclude that combining automatic item generation with human judgment offers a promising path toward scalable, high-quality diagnostic RC assessments.

Abstract: Existing approaches to language model alignment often treat safety as a tradeoff against helpfulness, which can lead to unacceptable responses in sensitive domains. To ensure reliable performance in such settings, we propose High-Confidence Safe Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (HC-RLHF), a method that provides high-confidence safety guarantees while maximizing helpfulness. Similar to previous methods, HC-RLHF explicitly decouples human preferences into helpfulness and harmlessness (safety), which are learned by training a reward model and a cost model, respectively. It then employs a two-step process to find safe solutions. In the first step, it optimizes the reward function under an intentionally pessimistic version of the cost constraint. In the second step, the trained model undergoes a safety test to verify whether its performance stays within an upper-confidence bound of the actual cost constraint. We provide a theoretical analysis of HC-RLHF, including proof that it will not return an unsafe solution with a probability greater than a user-specified threshold. For our empirical analysis, we apply HC-RLHF to align three different language models (Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2.5-3B, and LLaMa3.2-3B) with human preferences. Our results demonstrate that HC-RLHF produces safe models with high probability and can improve harmlessness and helpfulness compared to previous methods.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover closed-form mathematical expressions that accurately describe data, offering interpretability and analytical insight beyond standard black-box models. Existing SR methods often rely on population-based search or autoregressive modeling, which struggle with scalability and symbolic consistency. We introduce LIES (Logarithm, Identity, Exponential, Sine), a fixed neural network architecture with interpretable primitive activations that are optimized to model symbolic expressions. We develop a framework to extract compact formulae from LIES networks by training with an appropriate oversampling strategy and a tailored loss function to promote sparsity and to prevent gradient instability. After training, it applies additional pruning strategies to further simplify the learned expressions into compact formulae. Our experiments on SR benchmarks show that the LIES framework consistently produces sparse and accurate symbolic formulae outperforming all baselines. We also demonstrate the importance of each design component through ablation studies.

Abstract: Recent voxel-wise multimodal brain encoding studies have shown that multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a higher degree of brain alignment compared to unimodal models in both unimodal and multimodal stimulus settings. More recently, instruction-tuned multimodal models have shown to generate task-specific representations that align strongly with brain activity. However, prior work evaluating the brain alignment of MLLMs has primarily focused on unimodal settings or relied on non-instruction-tuned multimodal models for multimodal stimuli. To address this gap, we investigated brain alignment, that is, measuring the degree of predictivity of neural activity recorded while participants were watching naturalistic movies (video along with audio) with representations derived from MLLMs. We utilized instruction-specific embeddings from six video and two audio instruction-tuned MLLMs. Experiments with 13 video task-specific instructions show that instruction-tuned video MLLMs significantly outperform non-instruction-tuned multimodal (by 15%) and unimodal models (by 20%). Our evaluation of MLLMs for both video and audio tasks using language-guided instructions shows clear disentanglement in task-specific representations from MLLMs, leading to precise differentiation of multimodal functional processing in the brain. We also find that MLLM layers align hierarchically with the brain, with early sensory areas showing strong alignment with early layers, while higher-level visual and language regions align more with middle to late layers. These findings provide clear evidence for the role of task-specific instructions in improving the alignment between brain activity and MLLMs, and open new avenues for mapping joint information processing in both the systems. We make the code publicly available [https://github.com/subbareddy248/mllm_videos].

<title>Seeing Voices: Generating A-Roll Video from Audio with Mirage</title>

Abstract: From professional filmmaking to user-generated content, creators and consumers have long recognized that the power of video depends on the harmonious integration of what we hear (the video's audio track) with what we see (the video's image sequence). Current approaches to video generation either ignore sound to focus on general-purpose but silent image sequence generation or address both visual and audio elements but focus on restricted application domains such as re-dubbing. We introduce Mirage, an audio-to-video foundation model that excels at generating realistic, expressive output imagery from scratch given an audio input. When integrated with existing methods for speech synthesis (text-to-speech, or TTS), Mirage results in compelling multimodal video. When trained on audio-video footage of people talking (A-roll) and conditioned on audio containing speech, Mirage generates video of people delivering a believable interpretation of the performance implicit in input audio. Our central technical contribution is a unified method for training self-attention-based audio-to-video generation models, either from scratch or given existing weights. This methodology allows Mirage to retain generality as an approach to audio-to-video generation while producing outputs of superior subjective quality to methods that incorporate audio-specific architectures or loss components specific to people, speech, or details of how images or audio are captured. We encourage readers to watch and listen to the results of Mirage for themselves (see paper and comments for links).

Abstract: Attention is the critical component of a transformer. Yet the quadratic computational complexity of vanilla full attention in the input size and the inability of its linear attention variant to focus have been challenges for computer vision tasks. We provide a mathematical definition of generalized attention and formulate both vanilla softmax attention and linear attention within the general framework. We prove that generalized attention disperses, that is, as the number of keys tends to infinity, the query assigns equal weights to all keys. Motivated by the dispersion property and recent development of Mamba form of attention, we design Scalable and Efficient Mamba like Attention (SEMA) which utilizes token localization to avoid dispersion and maintain focusing, complemented by theoretically consistent arithmetic averaging to capture global aspect of attention. We support our approach on Imagenet-1k where classification results show that SEMA is a scalable and effective alternative beyond linear attention, outperforming recent vision Mamba models on increasingly larger scales of images at similar model parameter sizes.

Abstract: Accurate predictions rely on the expressiveness power of graph deep learning frameworks like graph neural networks and graph transformers, where a positional encoding mechanism has become much more indispensable in recent state-of-the-art works to record the canonical position information. However, the current positional encoding is limited in three aspects: (1) most positional encoding methods use pre-defined, and fixed functions, which are inadequate to adapt to the complex attributed graphs; (2) a few pioneering works proposed the learnable positional encoding but are still limited to the structural information, not considering the real-world time-evolving topological and feature information; (3) most positional encoding methods are equipped with transformers' attention mechanism to fully leverage their capabilities, where the dense or relational attention is often unaffordable on large-scale structured data. Hence, we aim to develop Learnable Spatial-Temporal Positional Encoding in an effective and efficient manner and propose a simple temporal link prediction model named L-STEP. Briefly, for L-STEP, we (1) prove the proposed positional learning scheme can preserve the graph property from the spatial-temporal spectral viewpoint, (2) verify that MLPs can fully exploit the expressiveness and reach transformers' performance on that encoding, (3) change different initial positional encoding inputs to show robustness, (4) analyze the theoretical complexity and obtain less empirical running time than SOTA, and (5) demonstrate its temporal link prediction out-performance on 13 classic datasets and with 10 algorithms in both transductive and inductive settings using 3 different sampling strategies. Also, \name\ obtains the leading performance in the newest large-scale TGB benchmark. Our code is available at https://github.com/kthrn22/L-STEP.

Abstract: With the advent of large language models (LLMs), software engineering agents (SWE agents) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for automating a range of software tasks -- from code generation and repair to test case synthesis. These agents operate autonomously by interpreting user input and responding to environmental feedback. While various agent architectures have demonstrated strong empirical performance, the internal decision-making worfklows that drive their behavior remain poorly understood. Deeper insight into these workflows hold promise for improving both agent reliability and efficiency. In this work, we present the first systematic study of SWE agent behavior through the lens of execution traces. Our contributions are as follows: (1) we propose the first taxonomy of decision-making pathways across five representative agents; (2) using this taxonomy, we identify three core components essential to agent success -- bug localization, patch generation, and reproduction test generation -- and study each in depth; (3) we study the impact of test generation on successful patch production; and analyze strategies that can lead to successful test generation; (4) we further conduct the first large-scale code clone analysis comparing agent-generated and developer-written patches and provide a qualitative study revealing structural and stylistic differences in patch content. Together, these findings offer novel insights into agent design and open avenues for building agents that are both more effective and more aligned with human development practices.

Abstract: Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are rapidly being adopted across industry, academia, and government sectors, owing to their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing. However, despite their strengths, the inconsistency and unpredictability of LLM outputs present substantial challenges, especially in security-critical domains such as access control. One critical issue that emerges prominently is the consistency of LLM-generated responses, which is paramount for ensuring secure and reliable operations.
  In this paper, we study the application of LLMs within the context of Cybersecurity Access Control Systems. Specifically, we investigate the consistency and accuracy of LLM-generated password policies, translating natural language prompts into executable pwquality.conf configuration files. Our experimental methodology adopts two distinct approaches: firstly, we utilize pre-trained LLMs to generate configuration files purely from natural language prompts without additional guidance. Secondly, we provide these models with official pwquality.conf documentation to serve as an informative baseline. We systematically assess the soundness, accuracy, and consistency of these AI-generated configurations. Our findings underscore significant challenges in the current generation of LLMs and contribute valuable insights into refining the deployment of LLMs in Access Control Systems.

Abstract: Graph learning models have demonstrated great prowess in learning expressive representations from large-scale graph data in a wide variety of real-world scenarios. As a prevalent strategy for training powerful graph learning models, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme first pre-trains graph learning models on unlabeled graph data in a self-supervised manner and then adapts them to specific downstream tasks. During the adaptation phase, graph prompting emerges as a promising approach that learns trainable prompts while keeping the pre-trained graph learning models unchanged. In this paper, we present a systematic review of recent advancements in graph prompting. First, we introduce representative graph pre-training methods that serve as the foundation step of graph prompting. Next, we review mainstream techniques in graph prompting and elaborate on how they design learnable prompts for graph prompting. Furthermore, we summarize the real-world applications of graph prompting from different domains. Finally, we discuss several open challenges in existing studies with promising future directions in this field.

Abstract: Despite their growing adoption across domains, large language model (LLM)-powered agents face significant security risks from backdoor attacks during training and fine-tuning. These compromised agents can subsequently be manipulated to execute malicious operations when presented with specific triggers in their inputs or environments. To address this pressing risk, we present ReAgent, a novel defense against a range of backdoor attacks on LLM-based agents. Intuitively, backdoor attacks often result in inconsistencies among the user's instruction, the agent's planning, and its execution. Drawing on this insight, ReAgent employs a two-level approach to detect potential backdoors. At the execution level, ReAgent verifies consistency between the agent's thoughts and actions; at the planning level, ReAgent leverages the agent's capability to reconstruct the instruction based on its thought trajectory, checking for consistency between the reconstructed instruction and the user's instruction. Extensive evaluation demonstrates ReAgent's effectiveness against various backdoor attacks across tasks. For instance, ReAgent reduces the attack success rate by up to 90\% in database operation tasks, outperforming existing defenses by large margins. This work reveals the potential of utilizing compromised agents themselves to mitigate backdoor risks.

Abstract: Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom, such as mobile manipulators, are often computationally prohibitive for real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-model motion planning pipeline, termed Re4MPC, which computes trajectories using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Re4MPC generates trajectories in a computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and constraints of the NMPC problem depending on the complexity of the task and robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based simulation involving a mobile manipulator. Experimental results demonstrate that Re4MPC is more computationally efficient and achieves higher success rates in reaching end-effector goals than the NMPC baseline, which computes whole-body trajectories without our learning mechanism.

Abstract: Deep speech classification tasks, including keyword spotting and speaker verification, are vital in speech-based human-computer interaction. Recently, the security of these technologies has been revealed to be susceptible to backdoor attacks. Specifically, attackers use noisy disruption triggers and speech element triggers to produce poisoned speech samples that train models to become vulnerable. However, these methods typically create only a limited number of backdoors due to the inherent constraints of the trigger function. In this paper, we propose that speech backdoor attacks can strategically focus on speech elements such as timbre and emotion, leveraging the Speech Large Language Model (SLLM) to generate diverse triggers. Increasing the number of triggers may disproportionately elevate the poisoning rate, resulting in higher attack costs and a lower success rate per trigger. We introduce the Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) as a mitigation strategy to address this challenge. The proposed attack is called the Speech Prompt Backdoor Attack (SPBA). Building on this foundation, we conducted attack experiments on two speech classification tasks, demonstrating that SPBA shows significant trigger effectiveness and achieves exceptional performance in attack metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various medical benchmarks, but their capabilities across different cognitive levels remain underexplored. Inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, we propose a multi-cognitive-level evaluation framework for assessing LLMs in the medical domain in this study. The framework integrates existing medical datasets and introduces tasks targeting three cognitive levels: preliminary knowledge grasp, comprehensive knowledge application, and scenario-based problem solving. Using this framework, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art general and medical LLMs from six prominent families: Llama, Qwen, Gemma, Phi, GPT, and DeepSeek. Our findings reveal a significant performance decline as cognitive complexity increases across evaluated models, with model size playing a more critical role in performance at higher cognitive levels. Our study highlights the need to enhance LLMs' medical capabilities at higher cognitive levels and provides insights for developing LLMs suited to real-world medical applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of text-to-vision generation diffusion models, classifier-free guidance has emerged as the most prevalent method for conditioning. However, this approach inherently requires twice as many steps for model forwarding compared to unconditional generation, resulting in significantly higher costs. While previous study has introduced the concept of adaptive guidance, it lacks solid analysis and empirical results, making previous method unable to be applied to general diffusion models. In this work, we present another perspective of applying adaptive guidance and propose Step AG, which is a simple, universally applicable adaptive guidance strategy. Our evaluations focus on both image quality and image-text alignment. whose results indicate that restricting classifier-free guidance to the first several denoising steps is sufficient for generating high-quality, well-conditioned images, achieving an average speedup of 20% to 30%. Such improvement is consistent across different settings such as inference steps, and various models including video generation models, highlighting the superiority of our method.

Text embedding models have become foundational in modern NLP, powering a wide range of applications and drawing increasing research attention. Yet, much of this progress remains narrowly focused on surface-level semantics. In contrast, linguistic theory emphasizes that meaning is often implicit, shaped by pragmatics, speaker intent, and sociocultural context. Current embedding models are typically trained on data that lacks such depth and evaluated on benchmarks that reward the capture of surface meaning. As a result, they struggle with tasks requiring interpretive reasoning, speaker stance, or social meaning. Our pilot study highlights this gap, showing that even state-of-the-art models perform only marginally better than simplistic baselines on implicit semantics tasks. To address this, we call for a paradigm shift: embedding research should prioritize more diverse and linguistically grounded training data, design benchmarks that evaluate deeper semantic understanding, and explicitly frame implicit meaning as a core modeling objective, better aligning embeddings with real-world language complexity.

<title>MD-ViSCo: A Unified Model for Multi-Directional Vital Sign Waveform Conversion</title>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of deep-learning methods generating a target vital sign waveform from a source vital sign waveform, most existing models are designed exclusively for a specific source-to-target pair. This requires distinct model architectures, optimization procedures, and pre-processing pipelines, resulting in multiple models that hinder usability in clinical settings. To address this limitation, we propose the Multi-Directional Vital-Sign Converter (MD-ViSCo), a unified framework capable of generating any target waveform such as electrocardiogram (ECG), photoplethysmogram (PPG), or arterial blood pressure (ABP) from any single input waveform with a single model. MD-ViSCo employs a shallow 1-Dimensional U-Net integrated with a Swin Transformer that leverages Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) to capture distinct waveform styles. To evaluate the efficacy of MD-ViSCo, we conduct multi-directional waveform generation on two publicly available datasets. Our framework surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (NabNet & PPG2ABP) on average across all waveform types, lowering Mean absolute error (MAE) by 8.8% and improving Pearson correlation (PC) by 4.9% over two datasets. In addition, the generated ABP waveforms satisfy the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) criterion and achieve Grade B on the British Hypertension Society (BHS) standard, outperforming all baselines. By eliminating the need for developing a distinct model for each task, we believe that this work offers a unified framework that can deal with any kind of vital sign waveforms with a single model in healthcare monitoring.

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, which leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use draft models for approximate LLM inference acceleration, extending their utility beyond traditional lossless speculative decoding. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/draft-based-approx-llm.

Abstract: Leveraging more test-time computation has proven to be an effective way to boost the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among various methods, the verify-and-improve paradigm stands out for enabling dynamic solution exploration and feedback incorporation. However, existing approaches often suffer from restricted feedback spaces and lack of coordinated training of different parties, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we model this multi-turn refinement process as a Markov Decision Process and introduce DPSDP (Direct Policy Search by Dynamic Programming), a reinforcement learning algorithm that trains an actor-critic LLM system to iteratively refine answers via direct preference learning on self-generated data. Theoretically, DPSDP can match the performance of any policy within the training distribution. Empirically, we instantiate DPSDP with various base models and show improvements on both in- and out-of-distribution benchmarks. For example, on benchmark MATH 500, majority voting over five refinement steps increases first-turn accuracy from 58.2% to 63.2% with Ministral-based models. An ablation study further confirms the benefits of multi-agent collaboration and out-of-distribution generalization.

Abstract: Training reasoning language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) for one-hot correctness inherently relies on the LM being able to explore and solve its task with some chance at initialization. Furthermore, a key use case of reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs) focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to simply "connect-the-dots" with detailed explanations tailored for their students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning framework.

Abstract: Cyclone rapid intensification is the rapid increase in cyclone wind intensity, exceeding a threshold of 30 knots, within 24 hours. Rapid intensification is considered an extreme event during a cyclone, and its occurrence is relatively rare, contributing to a class imbalance in the dataset. A diverse array of factors influences the likelihood of a cyclone undergoing rapid intensification, further complicating the task for conventional machine learning models. In this paper, we evaluate deep learning, ensemble learning and data augmentation frameworks to detect cyclone rapid intensification based on wind intensity and spatial coordinates. We note that conventional data augmentation methods cannot be utilised for generating spatiotemporal patterns replicating cyclones that undergo rapid intensification. Therefore, our framework employs deep learning models to generate spatial coordinates and wind intensity that replicate cyclones to address the class imbalance problem of rapid intensification. We also use a deep learning model for the classification module within the data augmentation framework to differentiate between rapid and non-rapid intensification events during a cyclone. Our results show that data augmentation improves the results for rapid intensification detection in cyclones, and spatial coordinates play a critical role as input features to the given models. This paves the way for research in synthetic data generation for spatiotemporal data with extreme events.

Abstract: Machine translation has long been a central task in natural language processing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been remarkable progress in translation quality. However, fully realizing the translation potential of LLMs remains an open challenge. Recent studies have explored multi-agent systems to decompose complex translation tasks into collaborative subtasks, showing initial promise in enhancing translation quality through agent cooperation and specialization. Nevertheless, existing multi-agent translation frameworks largely neglect foundational insights from cognitive translation studies. These insights emphasize how human translators employ different cognitive strategies, such as balancing literal and free translation, refining expressions based on context, and iteratively evaluating outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a cognitively informed multi-agent framework called TACTIC, which stands for T ranslation A gents with Cognitive- T heoretic Interactive Collaboration. The framework comprises six functionally distinct agents that mirror key cognitive processes observed in human translation behavior. These include agents for drafting, refinement, evaluation, scoring, context reasoning, and external knowledge gathering. By simulating an interactive and theory-grounded translation workflow, TACTIC effectively leverages the full capacity of LLMs for high-quality translation. Experimental results on diverse language pairs from the FLORES-200 and WMT24 benchmarks show that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the base model, TACTIC surpasses GPT-4.1 by an average of +0.6 XCOMET and +1.18 COMETKIWI-23. Compared to DeepSeek-R1, it further improves by +0.84 XCOMET and +2.99 COMETKIWI-23.

<title>Offline RL with Smooth OOD Generalization in Convex Hull and its Neighborhood</title>

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) struggles with distributional shifts, leading to the $Q$-value overestimation for out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. Existing methods address this issue by imposing constraints; however, they often become overly conservative when evaluating OOD regions, which constrains the $Q$-function generalization. This over-constraint issue results in poor $Q$-value estimation and hinders policy improvement. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to achieve better $Q$-value estimation by enhancing $Q$-function generalization in OOD regions within Convex Hull and its Neighborhood (CHN). Under the safety generalization guarantees of the CHN, we propose the Smooth Bellman Operator (SBO), which updates OOD $Q$-values by smoothing them with neighboring in-sample $Q$-values. We theoretically show that SBO approximates true $Q$-values for both in-sample and OOD actions within the CHN. Our practical algorithm, Smooth Q-function OOD Generalization (SQOG), empirically alleviates the over-constraint issue, achieving near-accurate $Q$-value estimation. On the D4RL benchmarks, SQOG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm to democratize machine learning (ML) on edge devices by enabling layer-wise model partitioning. However, existing SFL approaches suffer significantly from the straggler effect due to the heterogeneous capabilities of edge devices. To address the fundamental challenge, we propose adaptively controlling batch sizes (BSs) and model splitting (MS) for edge devices to overcome resource heterogeneity. We first derive a tight convergence bound of SFL that quantifies the impact of varied BSs and MS on learning performance. Based on the convergence bound, we propose HASFL, a heterogeneity-aware SFL framework capable of adaptively controlling BS and MS to balance communication-computing latency and training convergence in heterogeneous edge networks. Extensive experiments with various datasets validate the effectiveness of HASFL and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Time-Aware World Model (TAWM), a model-based approach that explicitly incorporates temporal dynamics. By conditioning on the time-step size, {\Delta}t, and training over a diverse range of {\Delta}t values -- rather than sampling at a fixed time-step -- TAWM learns both high- and low-frequency task dynamics across diverse control problems. Grounded in the information-theoretic insight that the optimal sampling rate depends on a system's underlying dynamics, this time-aware formulation improves both performance and data efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that TAWM consistently outperforms conventional models across varying observation rates in a variety of control tasks, using the same number of training samples and iterations. Our code can be found online at: github.com/anh-nn01/Time-Aware-World-Model.

Abstract: Safety validation of autonomous driving systems is extremely challenging due to the high risks and costs of real-world testing as well as the rarity and diversity of potential failures. To address these challenges, we train a denoising diffusion model to generate potential failure cases of an autonomous vehicle given any initial traffic state. Experiments on a four-way intersection problem show that in a variety of scenarios, the diffusion model can generate realistic failure samples while capturing a wide variety of potential failures. Our model does not require any external training dataset, can perform training and inference with modest computing resources, and does not assume any prior knowledge of the system under test, with applicability to safety validation for traffic intersections.

Abstract: We study the off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning problem, where the goal is to learn a policy from offline datasets collected from source and target domains with mismatched transition. Existing off-dynamics offline RL methods typically either filter source transitions that resemble those of the target domain or apply reward augmentation to source data, both constrained by the limited transitions available from the target domain. As a result, the learned policy is unable to explore target domain beyond the offline datasets. We propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics offline RL algorithm that addresses this limitation by enabling exploration of the target domain via learned dynamics. MOBODY generates new synthetic transitions in the target domain through model rollouts, which are used as data augmentation during offline policy learning. Unlike existing model-based methods that learn dynamics from a single domain, MOBODY tackles the challenge of mismatched dynamics by leveraging both source and target datasets. Directly merging these datasets can bias the learned model toward source dynamics. Instead, MOBODY learns target dynamics by discovering a shared latent representation of states and transitions across domains through representation learning. To stabilize training, MOBODY incorporates a behavior cloning loss that regularizes the policy. Specifically, we introduce a Q-weighted behavior cloning loss that regularizes the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather than uniformly imitating all actions in the dataset. These Q-values are learned from an enhanced target dataset composed of offline target data, augmented source data, and rollout data from the learned target dynamics. We evaluate MOBODY on MuJoCo benchmarks and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in challenging scenarios.

<title>How to Provably Improve Return Conditioned Supervised Learning?</title>

Abstract: In sequential decision-making problems, Return-Conditioned Supervised Learning (RCSL) has gained increasing recognition for its simplicity and stability in modern decision-making tasks. Unlike traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, RCSL frames policy learning as a supervised learning problem by taking both the state and return as input. This approach eliminates the instability often associated with temporal difference (TD) learning in offline RL. However, RCSL has been criticized for lacking the stitching property, meaning its performance is inherently limited by the quality of the policy used to generate the offline dataset. To address this limitation, we propose a principled and simple framework called Reinforced RCSL. The key innovation of our framework is the introduction of a concept we call the in-distribution optimal return-to-go. This mechanism leverages our policy to identify the best achievable in-dataset future return based on the current state, avoiding the need for complex return augmentation techniques. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that Reinforced RCSL can consistently outperform the standard RCSL approach. Empirical results further validate our claims, showing significant performance improvements across a range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs) both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering (QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem: fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence. Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA, where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks, Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models, highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient and accurate QA.

Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models. Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of Small Language Models (SLMs) for on-device and resource-constrained deployments has outpaced our understanding of their ethical risks. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale audit of instruction-tuned SLMs spanning 0.5 to 5 billion parameters-an overlooked "middle tier" between BERT-class encoders and flagship LLMs. Our evaluation includes nine open-source models from the Qwen 2.5, LLaMA 3.2, Gemma 3, and Phi families. Using the BBQ benchmark under zero-shot prompting, we analyze both utility and fairness across ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. This evaluation reveals three key insights. First, competence and fairness need not be antagonistic: Phi models achieve F1 scores exceeding 90 percent while exhibiting minimal bias, showing that efficient and ethical NLP is attainable. Second, social bias varies significantly by architecture: Qwen 2.5 models may appear fair, but this often reflects vacuous neutrality, random guessing, or evasive behavior rather than genuine ethical alignment. In contrast, LLaMA 3.2 models exhibit stronger stereotypical bias, suggesting overconfidence rather than neutrality. Third, compression introduces nuanced trade-offs: 4-bit AWQ quantization improves F1 scores in ambiguous settings for LLaMA 3.2-3B but increases disability-related bias in Phi-4-Mini by over 7 percentage points. These insights provide practical guidance for the responsible deployment of SLMs in applications demanding fairness and efficiency, particularly benefiting small enterprises and resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have started analyzing the cultural sensitivity of LLMs. In this respect, Etiquettes have been an active area of research. Etiquettes are region-specific and are an essential part of the culture of a region; hence, it is imperative to make LLMs sensitive to etiquettes. However, there needs to be more resources in evaluating LLMs for their understanding and bias with regard to etiquettes. In this resource paper, we introduce EtiCor++, a corpus of etiquettes worldwide. We introduce different tasks for evaluating LLMs for knowledge about etiquettes across various regions. Further, we introduce various metrics for measuring bias in LLMs. Extensive experimentation with LLMs shows inherent bias towards certain regions.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a commonly used approach for enhancing large language models (LLMs) with relevant and up-to-date information. However, the retrieved sources can often contain conflicting information and it remains unclear how models should address such discrepancies. In this work, we first propose a novel taxonomy of knowledge conflict types in RAG, along with the desired model behavior for each type. We then introduce CONFLICTS, a high-quality benchmark with expert annotations of conflict types in a realistic RAG setting. CONFLICTS is the first benchmark that enables tracking progress on how models address a wide range of knowledge conflicts. We conduct extensive experiments on this benchmark, showing that LLMs often struggle to appropriately resolve conflicts between sources. While prompting LLMs to explicitly reason about the potential conflict in the retrieved documents significantly improves the quality and appropriateness of their responses, substantial room for improvement in future research remains.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in post-hoc explainability techniques for neural networks, many current methods rely on heuristics and do not provide formally provable guarantees over the explanations provided. Recent work has shown that it is possible to obtain explanations with formal guarantees by identifying subsets of input features that are sufficient to determine that predictions remain unchanged using neural network verification techniques. Despite the appeal of these explanations, their computation faces significant scalability challenges. In this work, we address this gap by proposing a novel abstraction-refinement technique for efficiently computing provably sufficient explanations of neural network predictions. Our method abstracts the original large neural network by constructing a substantially reduced network, where a sufficient explanation of the reduced network is also provably sufficient for the original network, hence significantly speeding up the verification process. If the explanation is in sufficient on the reduced network, we iteratively refine the network size by gradually increasing it until convergence. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances the efficiency of obtaining provably sufficient explanations for neural network predictions while additionally providing a fine-grained interpretation of the network's predictions across different abstraction levels.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-driven Multi-agent systems (Mas) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex real-world tasks. However, existing Mas construction methods typically rely on manually crafted interaction mechanisms or heuristic rules, introducing human biases and constraining the autonomous ability. Even with recent advances in adaptive Mas construction, existing systems largely remain within the paradigm of semi-autonomous patterns. In this work, we propose MasHost, a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based framework for autonomous and query-adaptive Mas design. By formulating Mas construction as a graph search problem, our proposed MasHost jointly samples agent roles and their interactions through a unified probabilistic sampling mechanism. Beyond the accuracy and efficiency objectives pursued in prior works, we introduce component rationality as an additional and novel design principle in Mas. To achieve this multi-objective optimization, we propose Hierarchical Relative Policy Optimization (HRPO), a novel RL strategy that collaboratively integrates group-relative advantages and action-wise rewards. To our knowledge, our proposed MasHost is the first RL-driven framework for autonomous Mas graph construction. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that MasHost consistently outperforms most competitive baselines, validating its effectiveness, efficiency, and structure rationality.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to localize video clips corresponding to natural language queries, is a fundamental yet challenging task in video understanding. Existing Transformer-based methods often suffer from redundant attention and suboptimal multi-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose MLVTG, a novel framework that integrates two key modules: MambaAligner and LLMRefiner. MambaAligner uses stacked Vision Mamba blocks as a backbone instead of Transformers to model temporal dependencies and extract robust video representations for multi-modal alignment. LLMRefiner leverages the specific frozen layer of a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to implicitly transfer semantic priors, enhancing multi-modal alignment without fine-tuning. This dual alignment strategy, temporal modeling via structured state-space dynamics and semantic purification via textual priors, enables more precise localization. Extensive experiments on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and TVSum demonstrate that MLVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound, focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as line-of-sight detection, Doppler effect estimation, and Direction-of-Arrival estimation, paving the way for enabling LLMs to understand physical world.

Abstract: This paper introduces Evolutionary Multi-Objective Network Architecture Search (EMNAS) for the first time to optimize neural network architectures in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Autonomous Driving (AD). EMNAS uses genetic algorithms to automate network design, tailored to enhance rewards and reduce model size without compromising performance. Additionally, parallelization techniques are employed to accelerate the search, and teacher-student methodologies are implemented to ensure scalable optimization. This research underscores the potential of transfer learning as a robust framework for optimizing performance across iterative learning processes by effectively leveraging knowledge from earlier generations to enhance learning efficiency and stability in subsequent generations. Experimental results demonstrate that tailored EMNAS outperforms manually designed models, achieving higher rewards with fewer parameters. The findings of these strategies contribute positively to EMNAS for RL in autonomous driving, advancing the field toward better-performing networks suitable for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in the apical four-chamber (A4C) view of fetal echocardiography is essential for early diagnosis and prenatal evaluation of congenital heart disease (CHD). However, precise segmentation remains challenging due to ultrasound artifacts, speckle noise, anatomical variability, and boundary ambiguity across different gestational stages. To reduce the workload of sonographers and enhance segmentation accuracy, we propose DCD, an advanced deep learning-based model for automatic segmentation of key anatomical structures in the fetal A4C view. Our model incorporates a Dense Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (Dense ASPP) module, enabling superior multi-scale feature extraction, and a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to enhance adaptive feature representation. By effectively capturing both local and global contextual information, DCD achieves precise and robust segmentation, contributing to improved prenatal cardiac assessment.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate motion prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and informed decision-making in autonomous driving, particularly under dynamic real-world conditions that necessitate multi-modal forecasts. We introduce TrajFlow, a novel flow matching-based motion prediction framework that addresses the scalability and efficiency challenges of existing generative trajectory prediction methods. Unlike conventional generative approaches that employ i.i.d. sampling and require multiple inference passes to capture diverse outcomes, TrajFlow predicts multiple plausible future trajectories in a single pass, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining coherence across predictions. Moreover, we propose a ranking loss based on the Plackett-Luce distribution to improve uncertainty estimation of predicted trajectories. Additionally, we design a self-conditioning training technique that reuses the model's own predictions to construct noisy inputs during a second forward pass, thereby improving generalization and accelerating inference. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) demonstrate that TrajFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness for safety-critical autonomous driving applications. The code and other details are available on the project website https://traj-flow.github.io/.

<title>Efficient Post-Training Refinement of Latent Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Reasoning is a key component of language understanding in Large Language Models. While Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances performance via explicit intermediate steps, it suffers from sufficient token overhead and a fixed reasoning trajectory, preventing step-wise refinement. Recent advances in latent reasoning address these limitations by refining internal reasoning processes directly in the model's latent space, without producing explicit outputs. However, a key challenge remains: how to effectively update reasoning embeddings during post-training to guide the model toward more accurate solutions. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight post-training framework that refines latent reasoning trajectories using two novel strategies: 1) Contrastive reasoning feedback, which compares reasoning embeddings against strong and weak baselines to infer effective update directions via embedding enhancement; 2) Residual embedding refinement, which stabilizes updates by progressively integrating current and historical gradients, enabling fast yet controlled convergence. Extensive experiments and case studies are conducted on five reasoning benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Notably, a 5\% accuracy gain on MathQA without additional training.

Abstract: Differential equations are involved in modeling many engineering problems. Many efforts have been devoted to solving differential equations. Due to the flexibility of neural networks, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently been proposed to solve complex differential equations and have demonstrated superior performance in many applications. While the L2 loss function is usually a default choice in PINNs, it has been shown that the corresponding numerical solution is incorrect and unstable for some complex equations. In this work, we propose a new PINNs framework named Kernel Packet accelerated PINNs (KP-PINNs), which gives a new expression of the loss function using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm and uses the Kernel Packet (KP) method to accelerate the computation. Theoretical results show that KP-PINNs can be stable across various differential equations. Numerical experiments illustrate that KP-PINNs can solve differential equations effectively and efficiently. This framework provides a promising direction for improving the stability and accuracy of PINNs-based solvers in scientific computing.

Abstract: Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns, within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize high-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to fine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA) systems differ significantly across many dimensions, such as training datasets, modeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates efforts to evaluate models fairly and pinpoint which design choices most influence performance. While factors like data and architecture are important, in this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into associated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future text-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably most common modeling paradigms: Auto-Regressive decoding and Conditional Flow-Matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from scratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone architectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including generation quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability, adherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing capabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds light on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing actionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions in the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities across various tasks, but their claim to practical relevance is still mired by concerns on their reliability. Recent works have proposed examining the activations produced by an LLM at inference time to assess whether its answer to a question is correct. Some works claim that a "geometry of truth" can be learned from examples, in the sense that the activations that generate correct answers can be distinguished from those leading to mistakes with a linear classifier. In this work, we underline a limitation of these approaches: we observe that these "geometries of truth" are intrinsically task-dependent and fail to transfer across tasks. More precisely, we show that linear classifiers trained across distinct tasks share little similarity and, when trained with sparsity-enforcing regularizers, have almost disjoint supports. We show that more sophisticated approaches (e.g., using mixtures of probes and tasks) fail to overcome this limitation, likely because activation vectors commonly used to classify answers form clearly separated clusters when examined across tasks.

Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning approach that harnesses the power of generative artificial intelligence to enhance the accuracy of contextual forecasting in sewerage systems. By developing a diffusion-based model that processes multivariate time series data, our system excels at capturing complex correlations across diverse environmental signals, enabling robust predictions even during extreme weather events. To strengthen the model's reliability, we further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique, tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable contextual predictions, maintaining accuracy even under severe weather conditions.

Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size. Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate, through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition, we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states, which closely match recent experimental observations that the quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking quantum devices to photoisomerization.

Abstract: Transformers have become the architecture of choice for learning long-range dependencies, yet their adoption in hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is still emerging. We reviewed more than 300 papers published up to 2025 and present the first end-to-end survey dedicated to Transformer-based HSI classification. The study categorizes every stage of a typical pipeline-pre-processing, patch or pixel tokenization, positional encoding, spatial-spectral feature extraction, multi-head self-attention variants, skip connections, and loss design-and contrasts alternative design choices with the unique spatial-spectral properties of HSI. We map the field's progress against persistent obstacles: scarce labeled data, extreme spectral dimensionality, computational overhead, and limited model explainability. Finally, we outline a research agenda prioritizing valuable public data sets, lightweight on-edge models, illumination and sensor shifts robustness, and intrinsically interpretable attention mechanisms. Our goal is to guide researchers in selecting, combining, or extending Transformer components that are truly fit for purpose for next-generation HSI applications.

<title>WGLE:Backdoor-free and Multi-bit Black-box Watermarking for Graph Neural Networks</title>

arXiv:2506.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly deployed in graph-related applications, making ownership verification critical to protect their intellectual property against model theft. Fingerprinting and black-box watermarking are two main methods. However, the former relies on determining model similarity, which is computationally expensive and prone to ownership collisions after model post-processing such as model pruning or fine-tuning. The latter embeds backdoors, exposing watermarked models to the risk of backdoor attacks. Moreover, both methods enable ownership verification but do not convey additional information. As a result, each distributed model requires a unique trigger graph, and all trigger graphs must be used to query the suspect model during verification. Multiple queries increase the financial cost and the risk of detection.
  To address these challenges, this paper proposes WGLE, a novel black-box watermarking paradigm for GNNs that enables embedding the multi-bit string as the ownership information without using backdoors. WGLE builds on a key insight we term Layer-wise Distance Difference on an Edge (LDDE), which quantifies the difference between the feature distance and the prediction distance of two connected nodes. By predefining positive or negative LDDE values for multiple selected edges, WGLE embeds the watermark encoding the intended information without introducing incorrect mappings that compromise the primary task. WGLE is evaluated on six public datasets and six mainstream GNN architectures along with state-of-the-art methods. The results show that WGLE achieves 100% ownership verification accuracy, an average fidelity degradation of 0.85%, comparable robustness against potential attacks, and low embedding overhead. The code is available in the repository.

Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.

Abstract: Existing graph benchmarks assume non-spatial, simple edges, collapsing physically distinct paths into a single link. We introduce HSG-12M, the first large-scale dataset of $\textbf{spatial multigraphs}-$graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. HSG-12M contains 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic $\textit{Hamiltonian spectral graphs}$ across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, derived from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Each graph encodes the full geometry of a 1-D crystal's energy spectrum on the complex plane, producing diverse, physics-grounded topologies that transcend conventional node-coordinate datasets. To enable future extensions, we release $\texttt{Poly2Graph}$: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that maps arbitrary 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning from multi-edge geometry at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for geometry-aware graph learning and new opportunities of data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics and beyond.

Abstract: In the past decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved wide applicaiton in semantic segmentation tasks. Although CNNs with Transformer models greatly improve performance, the global context modeling remains inadequate. Recently, Mamba achieved great potential in vision tasks, showing its advantages in modeling long-range dependency. In this paper, we propose a lightweight Efficient CNN-Mamba Network for semantic segmentation, dubbed as ECMNet. ECMNet combines CNN with Mamba skillfully in a capsule-based framework to address their complementary weaknesses. Specifically, We design a Enhanced Dual-Attention Block (EDAB) for lightweight bottleneck. In order to improve the representations ability of feature, We devise a Multi-Scale Attention Unit (MSAU) to integrate multi-scale feature aggregation, spatial aggregation and channel aggregation. Moreover, a Mamba enhanced Feature Fusion Module (FFM) merges diverse level feature, significantly enhancing segmented accuracy. Extensive experiments on two representative datasets demonstrate that the proposed model excels in accuracy and efficiency balance, achieving 70.6% mIoU on Cityscapes and 73.6% mIoU on CamVid test datasets, with 0.87M parameters and 8.27G FLOPs on a single RTX 3090 GPU platform.

Abstract: In this article, we present a novel multimodal feedback framework called MOSAIC-F, an acronym for a data-driven Framework that integrates Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA), Observations, Sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Collaborative assessments for generating personalized feedback on student learning activities. This framework consists of four key steps. First, peers and professors' assessments are conducted through standardized rubrics (that include both quantitative and qualitative evaluations). Second, multimodal data are collected during learning activities, including video recordings, audio capture, gaze tracking, physiological signals (heart rate, motion data), and behavioral interactions. Third, personalized feedback is generated using AI, synthesizing human-based evaluations and data-based multimodal insights such as posture, speech patterns, stress levels, and cognitive load, among others. Finally, students review their own performance through video recordings and engage in self-assessment and feedback visualization, comparing their own evaluations with peers and professors' assessments, class averages, and AI-generated recommendations. By combining human-based and data-based evaluation techniques, this framework enables more accurate, personalized and actionable feedback. We tested MOSAIC-F in the context of improving oral presentation skills.

Abstract: Time series classification is a fundamental task in healthcare and industry, yet the development of time series foundation models (TSFMs) remains limited by the scarcity of publicly available time series datasets. In this work, we propose Time Vision Transformer (TiViT), a framework that converts time series into images to leverage the representational power of frozen Vision Transformers (ViTs) pretrained on large-scale image datasets. First, we theoretically motivate our approach by analyzing the 2D patching of ViTs for time series, showing that it can increase the number of label-relevant tokens and reduce the sample complexity. Second, we empirically demonstrate that TiViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard time series classification benchmarks by utilizing the hidden representations of large OpenCLIP models. We explore the structure of TiViT representations and find that intermediate layers with high intrinsic dimension are the most effective for time series classification. Finally, we assess the alignment between TiViT and TSFM representation spaces and identify a strong complementarity, with further performance gains achieved by combining their features. Our findings reveal yet another direction for reusing vision representations in a non-visual domain.

Abstract: Despite the commendable progress of recent LLM-based data synthesis methods, they face two limitations in generating table instruction tuning data. First, they can not thoroughly explore the vast input space of table understanding tasks, leading to limited data diversity. Second, they ignore the weaknesses in table understanding ability of the target LLM and blindly pursue the increase of data quantity, resulting in suboptimal data efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a progressive and weakness-guided data synthesis framework tailored for table instruction tuning, named TableDreamer, to mitigate the above issues. Specifically, we first synthesize diverse tables and related instructions as seed data, and then perform an iterative exploration of the input space under the guidance of the newly identified weakness data, which eventually serve as the final training data for fine-tuning the target LLM. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which boosts the average accuracy of Llama3.1-8B-instruct by 11.62% (49.07% to 60.69%) with 27K GPT-4o synthetic data and outperforms state-of-the-art data synthesis baselines which use more training data.

Abstract: We explore a generative relation extraction (RE) pipeline tailored to the study of interactions in the intestinal microbiome, a complex and low-resource biomedical domain. Our method leverages summarization with large language models (LLMs) to refine context before extracting relations via instruction-tuned generation. Preliminary results on a dedicated corpus show that summarization improves generative RE performance by reducing noise and guiding the model. However, BERT-based RE approaches still outperform generative models. This ongoing work demonstrates the potential of generative methods to support the study of specialized domains in low-resources setting.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence, highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures. The code used in this work is available at https://github.com/mahesh-godavarti/joformer.

<title>Towards Robust Real-World Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: A Unified Framework for Dependency, Asynchrony, and Missingness</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08660</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Real-world time series data are inherently multivariate, often exhibiting complex inter-channel dependencies. Each channel is typically sampled at its own period and is prone to missing values due to various practical and operational constraints. These characteristics pose fundamental challenges related to channel dependency, sampling asynchrony, and missingness, all of which must be addressed to enable robust and reliable forecasting in practical settings. However, most existing architectures are built on oversimplified assumptions, such as identical sampling periods across channels and fully observed inputs at test time, which often do not hold in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose ChannelTokenFormer, a Transformer-based forecasting model with a flexible architecture designed to explicitly capture cross-channel interactions, accommodate channel-wise asynchronous sampling, and effectively handle missing values. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets modified to reflect practical settings, along with one real-world industrial dataset, demonstrate the superior robustness and accuracy of ChannelTokenFormer under challenging real-world conditions.

<title>Optimizing Learned Image Compression on Scalar and Entropy-Constraint Quantization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08662</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08662</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous improvements on image compression with variational autoencoders have lead to learned codecs competitive with conventional approaches in terms of rate-distortion efficiency. Nonetheless, taking the quantization into account during the training process remains a problem, since it produces zero derivatives almost everywhere and needs to be replaced with a differentiable approximation which allows end-to-end optimization. Though there are different methods for approximating the quantization, none of them model the quantization noise correctly and thus, result in suboptimal networks. Hence, we propose an additional finetuning training step: After conventional end-to-end training, parts of the network are retrained on quantized latents obtained at the inference stage. For entropy-constraint quantizers like Trellis-Coded Quantization, the impact of the quantizer is particularly difficult to approximate by rounding or adding noise as the quantized latents are interdependently chosen through a trellis search based on both the entropy model and a distortion measure. We show that retraining on correctly quantized data consistently yields additional coding gain for both uniform scalar and especially for entropy-constraint quantization, without increasing inference complexity. For the Kodak test set, we obtain average savings between 1% and 2%, and for the TecNick test set up to 2.2% in terms of Bj{\o}ntegaard-Delta bitrate.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) offer promising and efficient alternatives to large language models (LLMs). However, SLMs' limited capacity restricts their reasoning capabilities and makes them sensitive to prompt variations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that enhances SLM reasoning capabilities through LLM generated blueprints. The blueprints provide structured, high-level reasoning guides that help SLMs systematically tackle related problems. Furthermore, our framework integrates a prompt template search mechanism to mitigate the SLMs' sensitivity to prompt variations. Our framework demonstrates improved SLM performance across various tasks, including math (GSM8K), coding (MBPP), and logic reasoning (BBH). Our approach improves the reasoning capabilities of SLMs without increasing model size or requiring additional training, offering a lightweight and deployment-friendly solution for on-device or resource-constrained environments.

<title>Variational Autoencoder-Based Approach to Latent Feature Analysis on Efficient Representation of Power Load Monitoring Data</title>

Abstract: With the development of smart grids, High-Dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) Power Load Monitoring (PLM) data challenges the performance of Power Load Forecasting (PLF) models. In this paper, we propose a potential characterization model VAE-LF based on Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for efficiently representing and complementing PLM missing data. VAE-LF learns a low-dimensional latent representation of the data using an Encoder-Decoder structure by splitting the HDI PLM data into vectors and feeding them sequentially into the VAE-LF model, and generates the complementary data. Experiments on the UK-DALE dataset show that VAE-LF outperforms other benchmark models in both 5% and 10% sparsity test cases, with significantly lower RMSE and MAE, and especially outperforms on low sparsity ratio data. The method provides an efficient data-completion solution for electric load management in smart grids.

<title>ConfPO: Exploiting Policy Model Confidence for Critical Token Selection in Large Language Model Preference Optimization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.08712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ConfPO, a method for preference learning in Large Language Models (LLMs) that identifies and optimizes preference-critical tokens based solely on the training policy's confidence, without requiring any auxiliary models or compute. Unlike prior Direct Alignment Algorithms (DAAs) such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which uniformly adjust all token probabilities regardless of their relevance to preference, ConfPO focuses optimization on the most impactful tokens. This targeted approach improves alignment quality while mitigating overoptimization (i.e., reward hacking) by using the KL divergence budget more efficiently. In contrast to recent token-level methods that rely on credit-assignment models or AI annotators, raising concerns about scalability and reliability, ConfPO is simple, lightweight, and model-free. Experimental results on challenging alignment benchmarks, including AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, demonstrate that ConfPO consistently outperforms uniform DAAs across various LLMs, delivering better alignment with zero additional computational overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on numerous natural language processing tasks. However, LLMs still struggle with numerical question answering for financial documents that include tabular and textual data. Recent works have showed the effectiveness of critic agents (i.e., self-correction) for this task given oracle labels. Building upon this framework, this paper examines the effectiveness of the traditional critic agent when oracle labels are not available, and show, through experiments, that this critic agent's performance deteriorates in this scenario. With this in mind, we present an improved critic agent, along with the calculator agent which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach (program-of-thought) and is safer. Furthermore, we investigate how our agents interact with each other, and how this interaction affects their performance.

Abstract: While Generative AI stands to be one of the fastest adopted technologies ever, studies have made evident that the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) puts significant burden on energy grids and our environment. It may prove a hindrance to the Sustainability goals of any organization. A crucial step in any Sustainability strategy is monitoring or estimating the energy consumption of various components. While there exist multiple tools for monitoring energy consumption, there is a dearth of tools/frameworks for estimating the consumption or carbon emissions. Current drawbacks of both monitoring and estimation tools include high input data points, intrusive nature, high error margin, etc. We posit that leveraging emerging LLM benchmarks and related data points can help overcome aforementioned challenges while balancing accuracy of the emission estimations. To that extent, we discuss the challenges of current approaches and present our evolving framework, R-ICE, which estimates prompt level inference carbon emissions by leveraging existing state-of-the-art(SOTA) benchmark. This direction provides a more practical and non-intrusive way to enable emerging use-cases like dynamic LLM routing, carbon accounting, etc. Our promising validation results suggest that benchmark-based modelling holds great potential for inference emission estimation and warrants further exploration from the scientific community.

<title>Geometric deep learning for local growth prediction on abdominal aortic aneurysm surfaces</title>

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are progressive focal dilatations of the abdominal aorta. AAAs may rupture, with a survival rate of only 20\%. Current clinical guidelines recommend elective surgical repair when the maximum AAA diameter exceeds 55 mm in men or 50 mm in women. Patients that do not meet these criteria are periodically monitored, with surveillance intervals based on the maximum AAA diameter. However, this diameter does not take into account the complex relation between the 3D AAA shape and its growth, making standardized intervals potentially unfit. Personalized AAA growth predictions could improve monitoring strategies. We propose to use an SE(3)-symmetric transformer model to predict AAA growth directly on the vascular model surface enriched with local, multi-physical features. In contrast to other works which have parameterized the AAA shape, this representation preserves the vascular surface's anatomical structure and geometric fidelity. We train our model using a longitudinal dataset of 113 computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 24 AAA patients at irregularly sampled intervals. After training, our model predicts AAA growth to the next scan moment with a median diameter error of 1.18 mm. We further demonstrate our model's utility to identify whether a patient will become eligible for elective repair within two years (acc = 0.93). Finally, we evaluate our model's generalization on an external validation set consisting of 25 CTAs from 7 AAA patients from a different hospital. Our results show that local directional AAA growth prediction from the vascular surface is feasible and may contribute to personalized surveillance strategies.

Abstract: We introduce Random Reward Perturbation (RRP), a novel exploration strategy for reinforcement learning (RL). Our theoretical analyses demonstrate that adding zero-mean noise to environmental rewards effectively enhances policy diversity during training, thereby expanding the range of exploration. RRP is fully compatible with the action-perturbation-based exploration strategies, such as $\epsilon$-greedy, stochastic policies, and entropy regularization, providing additive improvements to exploration effects. It is general, lightweight, and can be integrated into existing RL algorithms with minimal implementation effort and negligible computational overhead. RRP establishes a theoretical connection between reward shaping and noise-driven exploration, highlighting their complementary potential. Experiments show that RRP significantly boosts the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic, achieving higher sample efficiency and escaping local optima across various tasks, under both sparse and dense reward scenarios.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become deeply embedded in everyday life, calls to align AI development with ethical and societal values have intensified. Interdisciplinary collaboration is often championed as a key pathway for fostering such engagement. Yet it remains unclear whether interdisciplinary research teams are actually leading this shift in practice. This study analyzes over 100,000 AI-related papers published on ArXiv between 2014 and 2024 to examine how ethical values and societal concerns are integrated into technical AI research. We develop a classifier to identify societal content and measure the extent to which research papers express these considerations. We find a striking shift: while interdisciplinary teams remain more likely to produce societally-oriented research, computer science-only teams now account for a growing share of the field's overall societal output. These teams are increasingly integrating societal concerns into their papers and tackling a wide range of domains - from fairness and safety to healthcare and misinformation. These findings challenge common assumptions about the drivers of societal AI and raise important questions. First, what are the implications for emerging understandings of AI safety and governance if most societally-oriented research is being undertaken by exclusively technical teams? Second, for scholars in the social sciences and humanities: in a technical field increasingly responsive to societal demands, what distinctive perspectives can we still offer to help shape the future of AI?

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have substantially advanced the field of recommender systems. However, despite the creation of more than a thousand knowledge graphs (KGs) under the W3C standard RDF, their rich semantic information has not yet been fully leveraged in GNN-based recommender systems. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive integration of RDF KGs with GNNs that utilizes both the topological information from RDF object properties and the content information from RDF datatype properties. Our main focus is an in-depth evaluation of various GNNs, analyzing how different semantic feature initializations and types of graph structure heterogeneity influence their performance in recommendation tasks. Through experiments across multiple recommendation scenarios involving multi-million-node RDF graphs, we demonstrate that harnessing the semantic richness of RDF KGs significantly improves recommender systems and lays the groundwork for GNN-based recommender systems for the Linked Open Data cloud. The code and data are available on our GitHub repository: https://github.com/davidlamprecht/rdf-gnn-recommendation

Abstract: This study explores the application of in-context learning (ICL) to the dialogue state tracking (DST) problem and investigates the factors that influence its effectiveness. We use a sentence embedding based k-nearest neighbour method to retrieve the suitable demonstrations for ICL. The selected demonstrations, along with the test samples, are structured within a template as input to the LLM. We then conduct a systematic study to analyse the impact of factors related to demonstration selection and prompt context on DST performance. This work is conducted using the MultiWoZ2.4 dataset and focuses primarily on the OLMo-7B-instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama3.2-3B-Instruct models. Our findings provide several useful insights on in-context learning abilities of LLMs for dialogue state tracking.

Abstract: Real-world robotic applications, from autonomous exploration to assistive technologies, require adaptive, interpretable, and data-efficient learning paradigms. While deep learning architectures and foundation models have driven significant advances in diverse robotic applications, they remain limited in their ability to operate efficiently and reliably in unknown and dynamic environments. In this position paper, we critically assess these limitations and introduce a conceptual framework for combining data-driven learning with deliberate, structured reasoning. Specifically, we propose leveraging differentiable physics for efficient world modeling, Bayesian inference for uncertainty-aware decision-making, and meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new tasks. By embedding physical symbolic reasoning within neural models, robots could generalize beyond their training data, reason about novel situations, and continuously expand their knowledge. We argue that such hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures are essential for the next generation of autonomous systems, and to this end, we provide a research roadmap to guide and accelerate their development.

Abstract: Different machine learning models can represent the same underlying concept in different ways. This variability is particularly valuable for in-the-wild multimodal retrieval, where the objective is to identify the corresponding representation in one modality given another modality as input. This challenge can be effectively framed as a feature alignment problem. For example, given a sentence encoded by a language model, retrieve the most semantically aligned image based on features produced by an image encoder, or vice versa. In this work, we first investigate the geometric relationships between visual and textual embeddings derived from both vision-language models and combined unimodal models. We then align these representations using four standard similarity metrics as well as two learned ones, implemented via neural networks. Our findings indicate that the Wasserstein distance can serve as an informative measure of the modality gap, while cosine similarity consistently outperforms alternative metrics in feature alignment tasks. Furthermore, we observe that conventional architectures such as multilayer perceptrons are insufficient for capturing the complex interactions between image and text representations. Our study offers novel insights and practical considerations for researchers working in multimodal information retrieval, particularly in real-world, cross-modal applications.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of AI models requires flexible hardware capable of supporting diverse precision formats, particularly for energy-constrained edge platforms. This work presents PARV-CE, a SIMD-enabled, multi-precision MAC engine that performs efficient multiply-accumulate operations using a unified data-path for 4/8/16-bit fixed-point, floating point, and posit formats. The architecture incorporates a layer adaptive precision strategy to align computational accuracy with workload sensitivity, optimizing both performance and energy usage. PARV-CE integrates quantization-aware execution with a reconfigurable SIMD pipeline, enabling high-throughput processing with minimal overhead through hardware-software co-design. The results demonstrate up to 2x improvement in PDP and 3x reduction in resource usage compared to SoTA designs, while retaining accuracy within 1.8% FP32 baseline. The architecture supports both on-device training and inference across a range of workloads, including DNNs, RNNs, RL, and Transformer models. The empirical analysis establish PARVCE incorporated POLARON as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for precision-adaptive AI acceleration at edge.

Abstract: Software sustainability is emerging as a primary concern, aiming to optimize resource utilization, minimize environmental impact, and promote a greener, more resilient digital ecosystem. The sustainability or "greenness" of software is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and effective remediation strategies.

Abstract: Limb loss affects millions globally, impairing physical function and reducing quality of life. Most traditional surface electromyographic (sEMG) and semi-autonomous methods require users to generate myoelectric signals for each control, imposing physically and mentally taxing demands. This study aims to develop a fully autonomous control system that enables a prosthetic hand to automatically grasp and release objects of various shapes using only a camera attached to the wrist. By placing the hand near an object, the system will automatically execute grasping actions with a proper grip force in response to the hand's movements and the environment. To release the object being grasped, just naturally place the object close to the table and the system will automatically open the hand. Such a system would provide individuals with limb loss with a very easy-to-use prosthetic control interface and greatly reduce mental effort while using. To achieve this goal, we developed a teleoperation system to collect human demonstration data for training the prosthetic hand control model using imitation learning, which mimics the prosthetic hand actions from human. Through training the model using only a few objects' data from one single participant, we have shown that the imitation learning algorithm can achieve high success rates, generalizing to more individuals and unseen objects with a variation of weights.

Abstract: Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue, existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency 93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: The extraction of information about traffic accidents from legal documents is crucial for quantifying insurance company costs. Extracting entities such as percentages of physical and/or psychological disability and the involved compensation amounts is a challenging process, even for experts, due to the subtle arguments and reasoning in the court decision. A two-step procedure is proposed: first, segmenting the document identifying the most relevant segments, and then extracting the entities. For text segmentation, two methodologies are compared: a classic method based on regular expressions and a second approach that divides the document into blocks of n-tokens, which are then vectorized using multilingual models for semantic searches (text-embedding-ada-002/MiniLM-L12-v2 ). Subsequently, large language models (LLaMA-2 7b, 70b, LLaMA-3 8b, and GPT-4 Turbo) are applied with prompting to the selected segments for entity extraction. For the LLaMA models, fine-tuning is performed using LoRA. LLaMA-2 7b, even with zero temperature, shows a significant number of hallucinations in extractions which are an important contention point for named entity extraction. This work shows that these hallucinations are substantially reduced after finetuning the model. The performance of the methodology based on segment vectorization and subsequent use of LLMs significantly surpasses the classic method which achieves an accuracy of 39.5%. Among open-source models, LLaMA-2 70B with finetuning achieves the highest accuracy 79.4%, surpassing its base version 61.7%. Notably, the base LLaMA-3 8B model already performs comparably to the finetuned LLaMA-2 70B model, achieving 76.6%, highlighting the rapid progress in model development. Meanwhile, GPT-4 Turbo achieves the highest accuracy at 86.1%.

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics is a technology that captures gene expression levels at different spatial locations, widely used in tumor microenvironment analysis and molecular profiling of histopathology, providing valuable insights into resolving gene expression and clinical diagnosis of cancer. Due to the high cost of data acquisition, large-scale spatial transcriptomics data remain challenging to obtain. In this study, we develop a contrastive learning-based deep learning method to predict spatially resolved gene expression from whole-slide images. Evaluation across six different disease datasets demonstrates that, compared to existing studies, our method improves Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) in the prediction of highly expressed genes, highly variable genes, and marker genes by 6.27%, 6.11%, and 11.26% respectively. Further analysis indicates that our method preserves gene-gene correlations and applies to datasets with limited samples. Additionally, our method exhibits potential in cancer tissue localization based on biomarker expression.

<title>On The Impact of Merge Request Deviations on Code Review Practices</title>

Abstract: Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes (e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models for review analysis.
  We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in 53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*).
  Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and ensuring reliable insights.

Abstract: We introduce SeerAttention-R, a sparse attention framework specifically tailored for the long decoding of reasoning models. Extended from SeerAttention, SeerAttention-R retains the design of learning attention sparsity through a self-distilled gating mechanism, while removing query pooling to accommodate auto-regressive decoding. With a lightweight plug-in gating, SeerAttention-R is flexible and can be easily integrated into existing pretrained model without modifying the original parameters. We demonstrate that SeerAttention-R, trained on just 0.4B tokens, maintains near-lossless reasoning accuracy with 4K token budget in AIME benchmark under large sparse attention block sizes (64/128). Using TileLang, we develop a highly optimized sparse decoding kernel that achieves near-theoretical speedups of up to 9x over FlashAttention-3 on H100 GPU at 90% sparsity. Code is available at: https://github.com/microsoft/SeerAttention.

Abstract: Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of transformer-based language models has catalyzed breakthroughs in biomedical and clinical natural language processing; however, plant science remains markedly underserved by such domain-adapted tools. In this work, we present PlantBert, a high-performance, open-source language model specifically tailored for extracting structured knowledge from plant stress-response literature. Built upon the DeBERTa architecture-known for its disentangled attention and robust contextual encoding-PlantBert is fine-tuned on a meticulously curated corpus of expert-annotated abstracts, with a primary focus on lentil (Lens culinaris) responses to diverse abiotic and biotic stressors. Our methodology combines transformer-based modeling with rule-enhanced linguistic post-processing and ontology-grounded entity normalization, enabling PlantBert to capture biologically meaningful relationships with precision and semantic fidelity. The underlying corpus is annotated using a hierarchical schema aligned with the Crop Ontology, encompassing molecular, physiological, biochemical, and agronomic dimensions of plant adaptation. PlantBert exhibits strong generalization capabilities across entity types and demonstrates the feasibility of robust domain adaptation in low-resource scientific fields. By providing a scalable and reproducible framework for high-resolution entity recognition, PlantBert bridges a critical gap in agricultural NLP and paves the way for intelligent, data-driven systems in plant genomics, phenomics, and agronomic knowledge discovery. Our model is publicly released to promote transparency and accelerate cross-disciplinary innovation in computational plant science.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to the automated semantic analysis of legal texts using large language models (LLMs), targeting their transformation into formal representations in Defeasible Deontic Logic (DDL). We propose a structured pipeline that segments complex normative language into atomic snippets, extracts deontic rules, and evaluates them for syntactic and semantic coherence. Our methodology is evaluated across various LLM configurations, including prompt engineering strategies, fine-tuned models, and multi-stage pipelines, focusing on legal norms from the Australian Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code. Empirical results demonstrate promising alignment between machine-generated and expert-crafted formalizations, showing that LLMs - particularly when prompted effectively - can significantly contribute to scalable legal informatics.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training has fundamentally changed how machine learning research is done today: large foundation models are trained once, and then can be used by anyone in the community (including those without data or compute resources to train a model from scratch) to adapt and fine-tune to specific tasks. Applying this same framework to reinforcement learning (RL) is appealing because it offers compelling avenues for addressing core challenges in RL, including sample efficiency and robustness. However, there remains a fundamental challenge to pre-train large models in the context of RL: actions have long-term dependencies, so training a foundation model that reasons across time is important. Recent advances in generative AI have provided new tools for modeling highly complex distributions. In this paper, we build a probabilistic model to predict which states an agent will visit in the temporally distant future (i.e., an occupancy measure) using flow matching. As large datasets are often constructed by many distinct users performing distinct tasks, we include in our model a latent variable capturing the user intention. This intention increases the expressivity of our model, and enables adaptation with generalized policy improvement. We call our proposed method intention-conditioned flow occupancy models (InFOM). Comparing with alternative methods for pre-training, our experiments on $36$ state-based and $4$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves $1.8 \times$ median improvement in returns and increases success rates by $36\%$.

Abstract: We introduce an attention-based method that uses learned binary attention masks to ensure that only attended image regions influence the prediction. Context can strongly affect object perception, sometimes leading to biased representations, particularly when objects appear in out-of-distribution backgrounds. At the same time, many image-level object-centric tasks require identifying relevant regions, often requiring context. To address this conundrum, we propose a two-stage framework: stage 1 processes the full image to discover object parts and identify task-relevant regions, while stage 2 leverages input attention masking to restrict its receptive field to these regions, enabling a focused analysis while filtering out potentially spurious information. Both stages are trained jointly, allowing stage 2 to refine stage 1. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves robustness against spurious correlations and out-of-distribution backgrounds.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the predominant AI technology to date. An important perspective for Quantum Computing (QC) is the question whether QC has the potential to reduce the vast resource requirements for training and operating GenAI models. While large-scale generative NLP tasks are currently out of reach for practical quantum computers, the generation of short semantic structures such as passwords is not. Generating passwords that mimic real user behavior has many applications, for example to test an authentication system against realistic threat models. Classical password generation via deep learning have recently been investigated with significant progress in their ability to generate novel, realistic password candidates. In the present work we investigate the utility of adiabatic quantum computers for this task. More precisely, we study different encodings of token strings and propose novel approaches based on the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and the Unit-Disk Maximum Independent Set (UD-MIS) problems. Our approach allows us to estimate the token distribution from data and adiabatically prepare a quantum state from which we eventually sample the generated passwords via measurements. Our results show that relatively small samples of 128 passwords, generated on the QuEra Aquila 256-qubit neutral atom quantum computer, contain human-like passwords such as "Tunas200992" or "teedem28iglove".

Abstract: Knowledge editing techniques for large language models (LLMs) can inject knowledge that is later reproducible verbatim, but they fall short on propagating that knowledge: models cannot answer questions that require reasoning with the injected knowledge. We present a hypernetwork-based approach for knowledge propagation, named PropMEND, where we meta-learn how to modify gradients of a language modeling loss to encourage injected information to propagate. Our approach extends the meta-objective of MEND [29] so that gradient updates on knowledge are transformed to enable answering multi-hop questions involving that knowledge. We show improved performance on the RippleEdit dataset, showing almost 2x accuracy on challenging multi-hop questions whose answers are not explicitly stated in the injected fact. We further introduce a new dataset, Controlled RippleEdit, to evaluate the generalization of our hypernetwork, testing knowledge propagation along relations and entities unseen during hypernetwork training. PropMEND still outperforms existing approaches in unseen entity-relation pairs, yet the performance gap decreases substantially, suggesting future work in propagating knowledge to a wide range of relations.

Abstract: Recent research in vision-language models (VLMs) has centered around the possibility of equipping them with implicit long-form chain-of-thought reasoning -- akin to the success observed in language models -- via distillation and reinforcement learning. But what about the non-reasoning models already trained and deployed across the internet? Should we simply abandon them, or is there hope for a search mechanism that can elicit hidden knowledge and induce long reasoning traces -- without any additional training or supervision? In this paper, we explore this possibility using a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired algorithm, which injects subquestion-subanswer pairs into the model's output stream. We show that framing reasoning as a search process -- where subquestions act as latent decisions within a broader inference trajectory -- helps the model "connect the dots" between fragmented knowledge and produce extended reasoning traces in non-reasoning models. We evaluate our method across three benchmarks and observe consistent improvements. Notably, our approach yields a 2% overall improvement on MMMU-PRO, including a significant 9% gain in Liberal Arts.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in various tasks including mathematical reasoning, their development typically demands prohibitive computational resources. Recent advancements have reduced costs for training capable models, yet even these approaches rely on high-end hardware clusters. In this paper, we demonstrate that a single average gaming GPU can train a solid mathematical reasoning model, by integrating reinforcement learning and memory optimization techniques. Specifically, we train a 1.5B parameter mathematical reasoning model on RTX 3080 Ti of 16GB memory that achieves comparable or better performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks than models several times larger, in resource-constrained environments. Our results challenge the paradigm that state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning necessitates massive infrastructure, democratizing access to high-performance AI research. https://github.com/shinandrew/YouronMath.

Abstract: Communication among humans relies on conversational grounding, allowing interlocutors to reach mutual understanding even when they do not have perfect knowledge and must resolve discrepancies in each other's beliefs. This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) manage common ground in cases where they (don't) possess knowledge, focusing on facts in the political domain where the risk of misinformation and grounding failure is high. We examine the ability of LLMs to answer direct knowledge questions and loaded questions that presuppose misinformation. We evaluate whether loaded questions lead LLMs to engage in active grounding and correct false user beliefs, in connection to their level of knowledge and their political bias. Our findings highlight significant challenges in LLMs' ability to engage in grounding and reject false user beliefs, raising concerns about their role in mitigating misinformation in political discourse.

Abstract: Incompletely-Supervised Concealed Object Segmentation (ISCOS) involves segmenting objects that seamlessly blend into their surrounding environments, utilizing incompletely annotated data, such as weak and semi-annotations, for model training. This task remains highly challenging due to (1) the limited supervision provided by the incompletely annotated training data, and (2) the difficulty of distinguishing concealed objects from the background, which arises from the intrinsic similarities in concealed scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first unified method for ISCOS to address these challenges. To tackle the issue of incomplete supervision, we propose a unified mean-teacher framework, SEE, that leverages the vision foundation model, ``\emph{Segment Anything Model (SAM)}'', to generate pseudo-labels using coarse masks produced by the teacher model as prompts. To mitigate the effect of low-quality segmentation masks, we introduce a series of strategies for pseudo-label generation, storage, and supervision. These strategies aim to produce informative pseudo-labels, store the best pseudo-labels generated, and select the most reliable components to guide the student model, thereby ensuring robust network training. Additionally, to tackle the issue of intrinsic similarity, we design a hybrid-granularity feature grouping module that groups features at different granularities and aggregates these results. By clustering similar features, this module promotes segmentation coherence, facilitating more complete segmentation for both single-object and multiple-object images. We validate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple ISCOS tasks, and experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, SEE can serve as a plug-and-play solution, enhancing the performance of existing models.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks and robustness in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have been widely studied in various threat models; however, few consider environmental state perturbations, which are natural in embodied scenarios. To improve the robustness of DRL agents, we formulate the problem of environmental state perturbation, introducing a preliminary non-targeted attack method as a calibration adversary, and then propose a defense framework, named Boosted Adversarial Training (BAT), which first tunes the agents via supervised learning to avoid catastrophic failure and subsequently adversarially trains the agent with reinforcement learning. Extensive experimental results substantiate the vulnerability of mainstream agents under environmental state perturbations and the effectiveness of our proposed attack. The defense results demonstrate that while existing robust reinforcement learning algorithms may not be suitable, our BAT framework can significantly enhance the robustness of agents against environmental state perturbations across various situations.

Abstract: This research-to-practice work-in-progress (WIP) paper presents an AI-enabled smart tutor designed to provide homework assessment and feedback for students in an undergraduate circuit analysis course. We detail the tutor's design philosophy and core components, including open-ended question answering and homework feedback generation. The prompts are carefully crafted to optimize responses across different problems. The smart tutor was deployed on the Microsoft Azure platform and is currently in use in an undergraduate circuit analysis course at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering in a large, public, research-intensive institution in the Southeastern United States. Beyond offering personalized instruction and feedback, the tutor collects student interaction data, which is summarized and shared with the course instructor. To evaluate its effectiveness, we collected student feedback, with 90.9% of responses indicating satisfaction with the tutor. Additionally, we analyze a subset of collected data on preliminary circuit analysis topics to assess tutor usage frequency for each problem and identify frequently asked questions. These insights help instructors gain real-time awareness of student difficulties, enabling more targeted classroom instruction. In future work, we will release a full analysis once the complete dataset is available after the Spring 2025 semester. We also explore the potential applications of this smart tutor across a broader range of engineering disciplines by developing improved prompts, diagram-recognition methods, and database management strategies, which remain ongoing areas of research.

Abstract: The ability to train high-performing reward models with few-shot data is critical for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We propose a data augmentation and expansion framework that enables generative reward models trained on small datasets to achieve comparable performance to those trained on large-scale datasets. Traditional methods to train a generative reward model, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), are constrained by inefficiencies in sample pairing and limited data diversity. This work introduces preference refinement, which employs Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sampling to uncover diverse and high-quality preference relationships. It also incorporates a perplexity-based scoring mechanism to assign nuanced preference levels and utilizes Multi-level Direct Preference Optimization (M-DPO) to enable the model to capture finer-grained preference differences between samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances data efficiency and model performance, enabling reward models trained in a few-shot setting to achieve results on par with those trained on large-scale datasets. This study underscores the potential of data-efficient strategies in advancing reward model optimization, offering a robust solution for low-resource RLHF applications.

Abstract: Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models. Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them. Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models, offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series conditions.

Much current work focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation, remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.

Abstract: Medical vision-language alignment through cross-modal contrastive learning shows promising performance in image-text matching tasks, such as retrieval and zero-shot classification. However, conventional cross-modal contrastive learning (CLIP-based) methods suffer from suboptimal visual representation capabilities, which also limits their effectiveness in vision-language alignment. In contrast, although the models pretrained via multimodal masked modeling struggle with direct cross-modal matching, they excel in visual representation. To address this contradiction, we propose ALTA (ALign Through Adapting), an efficient medical vision-language alignment method that utilizes only about 8% of the trainable parameters and less than 1/5 of the computational consumption required for masked record modeling. ALTA achieves superior performance in vision-language matching tasks like retrieval and zero-shot classification by adapting the pretrained vision model from masked record modeling. Additionally, we integrate temporal-multiview radiograph inputs to enhance the information consistency between radiographs and their corresponding descriptions in reports, further improving the vision-language alignment. Experimental evaluations show that ALTA outperforms the best-performing counterpart by over 4% absolute points in text-to-image accuracy and approximately 6% absolute points in image-to-text retrieval accuracy. The adaptation of vision-language models during efficient alignment also promotes better vision and language understanding. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/DopamineLcy/ALTA.

Abstract: Speech technology systems struggle with many downstream tasks for child speech due to small training corpora and the difficulties that child speech pose. We apply a novel dataset, SpeechMaturity, to state-of-the-art transformer models to address a fundamental classification task: identifying child vocalizations. Unlike previous corpora, our dataset captures maximally ecologically-valid child vocalizations across an unprecedented sample, comprising children acquiring 25+ languages in the U.S., Bolivia, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The dataset contains 242,004 labeled vocalizations, magnitudes larger than previous work. Models were trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature (consonant+vowel), and immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Models trained on the dataset outperform state-of-the-art models trained on previous datasets, achieved classification accuracy comparable to humans, and were robust across rural and urban settings.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid, token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.

Abstract: The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.

Abstract: The rapid emergence of diverse large language models (LLMs) has spurred the development of LLM routers that assign user queries to the most suitable model. However, existing LLM routers typically perform a single-round, one-to-one mapping (\textit{i.e.}, assigning each query to a single model in isolation), which limits their capability to tackle complex tasks that demand the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs. In this paper, we present \textbf{Router-R1}, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that formulates multi-LLM routing and aggregation as a sequential decision process. Router-R1 instantiates the router itself as a capable LLM, leveraging its reasoning ability to interleave "think" actions (internal deliberation) with "route" actions (dynamic model invocation), and integrates each response into its evolving context. To guide learning, we employ a lightweight rule-based reward comprising format rewards, final outcome rewards, and a novel cost reward for performance and cost trade-off optimization, opening a pathway toward optimizing performance-cost tradeoffs via RL. Router-R1 also conditions only on simple model descriptors such as pricing, latency, and example performance, enabling strong generalization to unseen model selection. Experiments on seven general and multi-hop QA benchmarks show that Router-R1 outperforms over several strong baselines, achieving superior performance while maintaining robust generalization and cost management.Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/Router-R1.

<title>FZOO: Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer for Fine-Tuning Large Language Models towards Adam-Scale Speed</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09034</link>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often faces GPU memory bottlenecks: the backward pass of first-order optimizers like Adam increases memory usage to more than 10 times the inference level (e.g., 633 GB for OPT-30B). Zeroth-order (ZO) optimizers avoid this cost by estimating gradients only from forward passes, yet existing methods like MeZO usually require many more steps to converge. Can this trade-off between speed and memory in ZO be fundamentally improved? Normalized-SGD demonstrates strong empirical performance with greater memory efficiency than Adam. In light of this, we introduce FZOO, a Fast Zeroth-Order Optimizer toward Adam-Scale Speed. FZOO reduces the total forward passes needed for convergence by employing batched one-sided estimates that adapt step sizes based on the standard deviation of batch losses. It also accelerates per-batch computation through the use of Rademacher random vector perturbations coupled with CUDA's parallel processing. Extensive experiments on diverse models, including RoBERTa-large, OPT (350M-66B), Phi-2, and Llama3, across 11 tasks validate FZOO's effectiveness. On average, FZOO outperforms MeZO by 3 percent in accuracy while requiring 3 times fewer forward passes. For RoBERTa-large, FZOO achieves average improvements of 5.6 percent in accuracy and an 18 times reduction in forward passes compared to MeZO, achieving convergence speeds comparable to Adam. We also provide theoretical analysis proving FZOO's formal equivalence to a normalized-SGD update rule and its convergence guarantees. FZOO integrates smoothly into PEFT techniques, enabling even larger memory savings. Overall, our results make single-GPU, high-speed, full-parameter fine-tuning practical and point toward future work on memory-efficient pre-training.

<title>Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better</title>

Abstract: Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

Abstract: Agent Based Models (ABMs) often deal with systems where there is a lack of quantitative data or where quantitative data alone may be insufficient to fully capture the complexities of real-world systems. Expert knowledge and qualitative insights, such as those obtained through interviews, ethnographic research, historical accounts, or participatory workshops, are critical in constructing realistic behavioral rules, interactions, and decision-making processes within these models. However, there is a lack of systematic approaches that are able to incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data across the entire modeling cycle. To address this, we propose FREIDA (FRamework for Expert-Informed Data-driven Agent-based models), a systematic mixed-methods framework to develop, train, and validate ABMs, particularly in data-sparse contexts. Our main technical innovation is to extract what we call Expected System Behaviors (ESBs) from qualitative data, which are testable statements that can be evaluated on model simulations. Divided into Calibration Statements (CS) for model calibration and Validation Statements (VS) for model validation, they provide a quantitative scoring mechanism on the same footing as quantitative data. In this way, qualitative insights can inform not only model specification but also its parameterization and assessment of fitness for purpose, which is a long standing challenge. We illustrate the application of FREIDA through a case study of criminal cocaine networks in the Netherlands.

Abstract: Understanding how humans conceptualize and categorize natural objects offers critical insights into perception and cognition. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), a key question arises: can these models develop human-like object representations from linguistic and multimodal data? In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analyses to explore the relationship between object concept representations in LLMs and human cognition. We collected 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were stable, predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering similar to human mental representations. Remarkably, the dimensions underlying these embeddings were interpretable, suggesting that LLMs and MLLMs develop human-like conceptual representations of objects. Further analysis showed strong alignment between model embeddings and neural activity patterns in brain regions such as EBA, PPA, RSC, and FFA. This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to human ones, share fundamental similarities that reflect key aspects of human conceptual knowledge. Our findings advance the understanding of machine intelligence and inform the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.

Abstract: We introduce a relational approach to program synthesis. The key idea is to decompose synthesis tasks into simpler relational synthesis subtasks. Specifically, our representation decomposes a training input-output example into sets of input and output facts respectively. We then learn relations between the input and output facts. We demonstrate our approach using an off-the-shelf inductive logic programming (ILP) system on four challenging synthesis datasets. Our results show that (i) our representation can outperform a standard one, and (ii) an off-the-shelf ILP system with our representation can outperform domain-specific approaches.

Abstract: Innate values describe agents' intrinsic motivations, which reflect their inherent interests and preferences for pursuing goals and drive them to develop diverse skills that satisfy their various needs. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) is learning from interaction based on the feedback rewards of the environment. However, in real scenarios, the rewards are generated by agents' innate value systems, which differ vastly from individuals based on their needs and requirements. In other words, considering the AI agent as a self-organizing system, developing its awareness through balancing internal and external utilities based on its needs in different tasks is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support others and integrate community with safety and harmony in the long term. To address this gap, we propose a new RL model termed innate-values-driven RL (IVRL) based on combined motivations' models and expected utility theory to mimic its complex behaviors in the evolution through decision-making and learning. Then, we introduce two IVRL-based models: IV-DQN and IV-A2C. By comparing them with benchmark algorithms such as DQN, DDQN, A2C, and PPO in the Role-Playing Game (RPG) reinforcement learning test platform VIZDoom, we demonstrated that the IVRL-based models can help the agent rationally organize various needs, achieve better performance effectively.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for planning. However, unlike Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-whose performance naturally improves with inference-time computation scaling-standard diffusion-based planners offer only limited avenues for the scalability. In this paper, we introduce Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion (MCTD), a novel framework that integrates the generative strength of diffusion models with the adaptive search capabilities of MCTS. Our method reconceptualizes denoising as a tree-structured process, allowing partially denoised plans to be iteratively evaluated, pruned, and refined. By selectively expanding promising trajectories while retaining the flexibility to revisit and improve suboptimal branches, MCTD achieves the benefits of MCTS such as controlling exploration-exploitation trade-offs within the diffusion framework. Empirical results on challenging long-horizon tasks show that MCTD outperforms diffusion baselines, yielding higher-quality solutions as inference-time computation increases.

Abstract: While recent work has found that vision-language models trained under the Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework contain intrinsic social biases, the extent to which different upstream pre-training features of the framework relate to these biases, and hence how intrinsic bias and downstream performance are connected has been unclear. In this work, we present the largest comprehensive analysis to-date of how the upstream pre-training factors and downstream performance of CLIP models relate to their intrinsic biases. Studying 131 unique CLIP models, trained on 26 datasets, using 55 architectures, and in a variety of sizes, we evaluate bias in each model using 26 well-established unimodal and cross-modal principled Embedding Association Tests. We find that the choice of pre-training dataset is the most significant upstream predictor of bias, whereas architectural variations have minimal impact. Additionally, datasets curated using sophisticated filtering techniques aimed at enhancing downstream model performance tend to be associated with higher levels of intrinsic bias. Finally, we observe that intrinsic bias is often significantly correlated with downstream performance ($0.3 \leq r \leq 0.8$), suggesting that models optimized for performance inadvertently learn to amplify representational biases. Comparisons between unimodal and cross-modal association tests reveal that social group bias depends heavily on the modality. Our findings imply that more sophisticated strategies are needed to address intrinsic model bias for vision-language models across the entire model development pipeline.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization is identifying equivalent formulations. Despite the growing need for automated equivalence checks -- driven, for example, by optimization copilots, which generate problem formulations from natural language descriptions -- current approaches rely on simple heuristics that fail to reliably check formulation equivalence. Inspired by Karp reductions, in this work we introduce Quasi-Karp equivalence, a formal criterion for determining when two optimization formulations are equivalent based on the existence of a mapping between their decision variables. We propose EquivaMap, a framework that leverages large language models to automatically discover such mappings for scalable, reliable equivalence checking, with a verification stage that ensures mapped solutions preserve feasibility and optimality without additional solver calls. To evaluate our approach, we construct EquivaFormulation, the first open-source dataset of equivalent optimization formulations, generated by applying transformations such as adding slack variables or valid inequalities to existing formulations. Empirically, EquivaMap significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial improvements in correctly identifying formulation equivalence.

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine learning, current artificial intelligence systems continue to fall short of human-like general intelligence. While large language models can generate fluent and coherent outputs, they lack the deep understanding and adaptive reasoning that characterize truly general intelligence. Existing evaluation frameworks, which are centered on broad language or perception tasks, fail to capture generality at its core and offer little guidance for incremental progress. To address this gap, this paper introduces the artificial general intelligence testbed (AGITB), a novel and freely available benchmarking suite comprising twelve fully automatable tests designed to evaluate low-level cognitive precursors through binary signal prediction. AGITB requires models to forecast temporal sequences without pretraining, symbolic manipulation, or semantic grounding. The framework isolates core computational invariants - such as determinism, sensitivity, and generalization - that align with principles of biological information processing. Engineered to resist brute-force and memorization-based approaches, AGITB presumes no prior knowledge and demands learning from first principles. While humans pass all tests, no current AI system has met the full AGITB criteria, underscoring its potential as a rigorous, interpretable, and actionable benchmark for guiding and evaluating progress toward artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: Map digitization is an important process that converts maps into digital formats that can be used for further analysis. This process typically requires a deep human involvement because of the need for interpretation and decision-making when translating complex features. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, there is an alternative to conducting map digitization with the help of machine learning techniques. Deepness, or Deep Neural Remote Sensing, is an advanced AI-driven tool designed and integrated as a plugin in QGIS application. This research focuses on assessing the effectiveness of Deepness in automated digitization. This study analyses AI-generated digitization results from Google Earth imagery and compares them with digitized outputs from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to evaluate performance.

Abstract: Large multi-modal models inevitably decay over time as facts update and previously learned information becomes outdated. Traditional approaches such as fine-tuning are often impractical for updating these models due to their size and complexity. Instead, direct knowledge editing within the models presents a more viable solution. Current model editing techniques, however, typically overlook the unique influence ranges of different facts, leading to compromised model performance in terms of both generality and locality. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. We develop a new model editing dataset named OKEDIT, specifically designed to effectively evaluate this trade-off. Building on this foundation, we propose \textbf{BalancEdit}, a novel method for balanced model editing that dynamically achieves an optimal balance between generality and locality. BalancEdit utilizes a unique mechanism that generates both positive and negative samples for each fact to accurately determine its influence scope and incorporates these insights into the model's latent space using a discrete, localized codebook of edits, without modifying the underlying model weights. To our knowledge, this is the first approach explicitly addressing the generality-locality trade-off in multi-modal model editing. Our comprehensive results confirm the effectiveness of BalancEdit, demonstrating minimal trade-offs while maintaining robust editing capabilities. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/donglgcn/BalancEdit/tree/MMOKVQA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1) we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require trustworthiness.

Abstract: Human-like agents are an increasingly important topic in games and beyond. Believable non-player characters enhance the gaming experience by improving immersion and providing entertainment. They also offer players the opportunity to engage with AI entities that can function as opponents, teachers, or cooperating partners. Additionally, in games where bots are prohibited -- and even more so in non-game environments -- there is a need for methods capable of identifying whether digital interactions occur with bots or humans. This leads to two fundamental research questions: (1) how to model and implement human-like AI, and (2) how to measure its degree of human likeness.
  This article offers two contributions. The first one is a survey of the most significant challenges in implementing human-like AI in games (or any virtual environment featuring simulated agents, although this article specifically focuses on games). Thirteen such challenges, both conceptual and technical, are discussed in detail. The second is an empirical study performed in a tactical video game that addresses the research question: "Is it possible to distinguish human players from bots (AI agents) based on empirical data?" A machine-learning approach using a custom deep recurrent convolutional neural network is presented. We hypothesize that the more challenging it is to create human-like AI for a given game, the easier it becomes to develop a method for distinguishing humans from AI-driven players.

Abstract: This paper presents an intelligent work automation approach in the context of contemporary digital transformation by integrating generative AI and Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) technologies with an Automation Agent to realize End-to-End (E2E) automation of corporate financial expense processing tasks. While traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven effective for repetitive, rule-based simple task automation, it faces limitations in handling unstructured data, exception management, and complex decision-making. This study designs and implements a four-stage integrated process comprising automatic recognition of supporting documents such as receipts via OCR/IDP, item classification based on a policy-driven database, intelligent exception handling supported by generative AI (large language models, LLMs), and human-in-the-loop final decision-making with continuous system learning through an Automation Agent. Applied to a major Korean enterprise (Company S), the system demonstrated quantitative benefits including over 80% reduction in processing time for paper receipt expense tasks, decreased error rates, and improved compliance, as well as qualitative benefits such as enhanced accuracy and consistency, increased employee satisfaction, and data-driven decision support. Furthermore, the system embodies a virtuous cycle by learning from human judgments to progressively improve automatic exception handling capabilities. Empirically, this research confirms that the organic integration of generative AI, IDP, and Automation Agents effectively overcomes the limitations of conventional automation and enables E2E automation of complex corporate processes. The study also discusses potential extensions to other domains such as accounting, human resources, and procurement, and proposes future directions for AI-driven hyper-automation development.

Abstract: The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful, tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL (Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness, evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.

Abstract: We present a lightweight system for stereo matching through embedded GPUs. It breaks the trade-off between accuracy and processing speed in stereo matching, enabling our embedded system to further improve the matching accuracy while ensuring real-time processing. The main idea of our method is to construct a tiny neural network based on variational auto-encoder (VAE) to upsample and refinement a small size of coarse disparity map, which is first generated by a traditional matching method. The proposed hybrid structure cannot only bring the advantage of traditional methods in terms of computational complexity, but also ensure the matching accuracy under the impact of neural network. Extensive experiments on the KITTI 2015 benchmark demonstrate that our tiny system exhibits high robustness in improving the accuracy of the coarse disparity maps generated by different algorithms, while also running in real-time on embedded GPUs.

Abstract: Robotic systems that rely primarily on self-supervised learning have the potential to decrease the amount of human annotation and engineering effort required to learn control strategies. In the same way that prior robotic systems have leveraged self-supervised techniques from computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), our work builds on prior work showing that the reinforcement learning (RL) itself can be cast as a self-supervised problem: learning to reach any goal without human-specified rewards or labels. Despite the seeming appeal, little (if any) prior work has demonstrated how self-supervised RL methods can be practically deployed on robotic systems. By first studying a challenging simulated version of this task, we discover design decisions about architectures and hyperparameters that increase the success rate by $2 \times$. These findings lay the groundwork for our main result: we demonstrate that a self-supervised RL algorithm based on contrastive learning can solve real-world, image-based robotic manipulation tasks, with tasks being specified by a single goal image provided after training.

<title>Edge Computing based Human-Robot Cognitive Fusion: A Medical Case Study in the Autism Spectrum Disorder Therapy</title>

Abstract: In recent years, edge computing has served as a paradigm that enables many future technologies like AI, Robotics, IoT, and high-speed wireless sensor networks (like 5G) by connecting cloud computing facilities and services to the end users. Especially in medical and healthcare applications, it provides remote patient monitoring and increases voluminous multimedia. From the robotics angle, robot-assisted therapy (RAT) is an active-assistive robotic technology in rehabilitation robotics, attracting researchers to study and benefit people with disability like autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children. However, the main challenge of RAT is that the model capable of detecting the affective states of ASD people exists and can recall individual preferences. Moreover, involving expert diagnosis and recommendations to guide robots in updating the therapy approach to adapt to different statuses and scenarios is a crucial part of the ASD therapy process. This paper proposes the architecture of edge cognitive computing by combining human experts and assisted robots collaborating in the same framework to achieve a seamless remote diagnosis, round-the-clock symptom monitoring, emergency warning, therapy alteration, and advanced assistance.

<title>Innate-Values-driven Reinforcement Learning based Cooperative Multi-Agent Cognitive Modeling</title>

Abstract: In multi-agent systems (MAS), the dynamic interaction among multiple decision-makers is driven by their innate values, affecting the environment's state, and can cause specific behavioral patterns to emerge. On the other hand, innate values in cognitive modeling reflect individual interests and preferences for specific tasks and drive them to develop diverse skills and plans, satisfying their various needs and achieving common goals in cooperation. Therefore, building the awareness of AI agents to balance the group utilities and system costs and meet group members' needs in their cooperation is a crucial problem for individuals learning to support their community and even integrate into human society in the long term. However, the current MAS reinforcement learning domain lacks a general intrinsic model to describe agents' dynamic motivation for decision-making and learning from an individual needs perspective in their cooperation. To address the gap, this paper proposes a general MAS innate-values reinforcement learning (IVRL) architecture from the individual preferences angle. We tested the Multi-Agent IVRL Actor-Critic Model in different StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) settings, which demonstrated its potential to organize the group's behaviours to achieve better performance.

<title>Structuring Concept Space with the Musical Circle of Fifths by Utilizing Music Grammar Based Activations</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the intriguing similarities between the structure of a discrete neural network, such as a spiking network, and the composition of a piano piece. While both involve nodes or notes that are activated sequentially or in parallel, the latter benefits from the rich body of music theory to guide meaningful combinations. We propose a novel approach that leverages musical grammar to regulate activations in a spiking neural network, allowing for the representation of symbols as attractors. By applying rules for chord progressions from music theory, we demonstrate how certain activations naturally follow others, akin to the concept of attraction. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of modulating keys to navigate different basins of attraction within the network. Ultimately, we show that the map of concepts in our model is structured by the musical circle of fifths, highlighting the potential for leveraging music theory principles in deep learning algorithms.

<title>Exploring the Escalation of Source Bias in User, Data, and Recommender System Feedback Loop</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems are essential for information access, allowing users to present their content for recommendation. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), primarily in the form of text, has become a central part of the content ecosystem. As AIGC becomes increasingly prevalent, it is important to understand how it affects the performance and dynamics of recommender systems. To this end, we construct an environment that incorporates AIGC to explore its short-term impact. The results from popular sequential recommendation models reveal that AIGC are ranked higher in the recommender system, reflecting the phenomenon of source bias. To further explore the long-term impact of AIGC, we introduce a feedback loop with realistic simulators. The results show that the model's preference for AIGC increases as the user clicks on AIGC rises and the model trains on simulated click data. This leads to two issues: In the short term, bias toward AIGC encourages LLM-based content creation, increasing AIGC content, and causing unfair traffic distribution. From a long-term perspective, our experiments also show that when AIGC dominates the content ecosystem after a feedback loop, it can lead to a decline in recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose a debiasing method based on L1-loss optimization to maintain long-term content ecosystem balance. In a real-world environment with AIGC generated by mainstream LLMs, our method ensures a balance between AIGC and human-generated content in the ecosystem. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Yuqi-Zhou/Rec_SourceBias.

<title>AI as Decision-Maker: Ethics and Risk Preferences of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit surprisingly diverse risk preferences when acting as AI decision makers, a crucial characteristic whose origins remain poorly understood despite their expanding economic roles. We analyze 50 LLMs using behavioral tasks, finding stable but diverse risk profiles. Alignment tuning for harmlessness, helpfulness, and honesty significantly increases risk aversion, causally increasing risk aversion confirmed via comparative difference analysis: a ten percent ethics increase cuts risk appetite two to eight percent. This induced caution persists against prompts and affects economic forecasts. Alignment enhances safety but may also suppress valuable risk taking, revealing a tradeoff risking suboptimal economic outcomes. With AI models becoming more powerful and influential in economic decisions while alignment grows increasingly critical, our empirical framework serves as an adaptable and enduring benchmark to track risk preferences and monitor this crucial tension between ethical alignment and economically valuable risk-taking.

<title>Scaling Laws in Linear Regression: Compute, Parameters, and Data</title>

Abstract: Empirically, large-scale deep learning models often satisfy a neural scaling law: the test error of the trained model improves polynomially as the model size and data size grow. However, conventional wisdom suggests the test error consists of approximation, bias, and variance errors, where the variance error increases with model size. This disagrees with the general form of neural scaling laws, which predict that increasing model size monotonically improves performance.
  We study the theory of scaling laws in an infinite dimensional linear regression setup. Specifically, we consider a model with $M$ parameters as a linear function of sketched covariates. The model is trained by one-pass stochastic gradient descent (SGD) using $N$ data. Assuming the optimal parameter satisfies a Gaussian prior and the data covariance matrix has a power-law spectrum of degree $a>1$, we show that the reducible part of the test error is $\Theta(M^{-(a-1)} + N^{-(a-1)/a})$. The variance error, which increases with $M$, is dominated by the other errors due to the implicit regularization of SGD, thus disappearing from the bound. Our theory is consistent with the empirical neural scaling laws and verified by numerical simulation.

<title>Textual Unlearning Gives a False Sense of Unlearning</title>

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are prone to ''memorizing'' training data, including substantial sensitive user information. To mitigate privacy risks and safeguard the right to be forgotten, machine unlearning has emerged as a promising approach for enabling LMs to efficiently ''forget'' specific texts. However, despite the good intentions, is textual unlearning really as effective and reliable as expected? To address the concern, we first propose Unlearning Likelihood Ratio Attack+ (U-LiRA+), a rigorous textual unlearning auditing method, and find that unlearned texts can still be detected with very high confidence after unlearning. Further, we conduct an in-depth investigation on the privacy risks of textual unlearning mechanisms in deployment and present the Textual Unlearning Leakage Attack (TULA), along with its variants in both black- and white-box scenarios. We show that textual unlearning mechanisms could instead reveal more about the unlearned texts, exposing them to significant membership inference and data reconstruction risks. Our findings highlight that existing textual unlearning actually gives a false sense of unlearning, underscoring the need for more robust and secure unlearning mechanisms.

Abstract: Macro placement is a vital step in digital circuit design that defines the physical location of large collections of components, known as macros, on a 2D chip. Because key performance metrics of the chip are determined by the placement, optimizing it is crucial. Existing learning-based methods typically fall short because of their reliance on reinforcement learning (RL), which is slow and struggles to generalize, requiring online training on each new circuit. Instead, we train a diffusion model capable of placing new circuits zero-shot, using guided sampling in lieu of RL to optimize placement quality. To enable such models to train at scale, we designed a capable yet efficient architecture for the denoising model, and propose a novel algorithm to generate large synthetic datasets for pre-training. To allow zero-shot transfer to real circuits, we empirically study the design decisions of our dataset generation algorithm, and identify several key factors enabling generalization. When trained on our synthetic data, our models generate high-quality placements on unseen, realistic circuits, achieving competitive performance on placement benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Early detection of drought stress is critical for taking timely measures for reducing crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible. The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress. This offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring for farmers to undertake informed decisions for improved crop management.

Abstract: High-throughput phenotyping automates the mapping of patient signs to standardized ontology concepts and is essential for precision medicine. This study evaluates the automation of phenotyping of clinical summaries from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database using large language models. Due to their rich phenotype data, these summaries can be surrogates for physician notes. We conduct a performance comparison of GPT-4 and GPT-3.5-Turbo. Our results indicate that GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5-Turbo in identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while obviating the need for manually annotated training data. Large language models are expected to be the dominant method for automating high-throughput phenotyping of clinical text.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in computer vision tasks. However, their parameter-intensive nature and reliance on large amounts of data for effective performance have shifted the focus from traditional human-annotated labels to unsupervised learning and pretraining strategies that uncover hidden structures within the data. In response to this challenge, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm. SSL leverages inherent relationships within the data itself as a form of supervision, eliminating the need for manual labeling and offering a more scalable and resource-efficient alternative for model training. Given these advantages, it is imperative to explore the integration of SSL techniques with ViTs, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Inspired by this evolving trend, this survey aims to systematically review SSL mechanisms tailored for ViTs. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy to classify SSL techniques based on their representations and pre-training tasks. Additionally, we discuss the motivations behind SSL, review prominent pre-training tasks, and highlight advancements and challenges in this field. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative analysis of various SSL methods designed for ViTs, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and applicability to different scenarios.

<title>The Impact of Large Language Models on Open-source Innovation: Evidence from GitHub Copilot</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to enhance individual productivity in guided settings. Whereas LLMs are likely to also transform innovation processes in a collaborative work setting, it is unclear what trajectory this transformation will follow. Innovation in these contexts encompasses both capability innovation that explores new possibilities by acquiring new competencies in a project and iterative innovation that exploits existing foundations by enhancing established competencies and improving project quality. Whether LLMs affect these two aspects of collaborative work and to what extent is an open empirical question. Open-source development provides an ideal setting to examine LLM impacts on these innovation types, as its voluntary and open/collaborative nature of contributions provides the greatest opportunity for technological augmentation. We focus on open-source projects on GitHub by leveraging a natural experiment around the selective rollout of GitHub Copilot (a programming-focused LLM) in October 2021, where GitHub Copilot selectively supported programming languages like Python or Rust, but not R or Haskell. We observe a significant jump in overall contributions, suggesting that LLMs effectively augment collaborative innovation in an unguided setting. Interestingly, Copilot's launch increased iterative innovation focused on maintenance-related or feature-refining contributions significantly more than it did capability innovation through code-development or feature-introducing commits. This disparity was more pronounced after the model upgrade in June 2022 and was evident in active projects with extensive coding activity, suggesting that as both LLM capabilities and/or available contextual information improve, the gap between capability and iterative innovation may widen. We discuss practical and policy implications to incentivize high-value innovative solutions.

Abstract: We present a system that transforms speech into physical objects using 3D generative AI and discrete robotic assembly. By leveraging natural language input, the system makes design and manufacturing more accessible to individuals without expertise in 3D modeling or robotic programming. While current generative AI models can produce a wide range of 3D digital assets, AI-generated meshes are not directly suitable for robotic fabrication and do not account for fabrication constraints. To address this, we contribute a workflow that integrates natural language processing, 3D generative AI, and discrete robotic assembly. The system automatically analyzes and modifies AI-generated geometry to meet physical constraints, such as component count, overhangs, and connectivity, and produces a feasible robotic assembly sequence and toolpath. The results are demonstrated through the assembly of various objects, ranging from chairs to shelves, which are prompted via speech and realized within 5 minutes using a robotic arm.

Abstract: To effectively study complex causal systems, it is often useful to construct abstractions of parts of the system by discarding irrelevant details while preserving key features. The Information Bottleneck (IB) method is a widely used approach to construct variable abstractions by compressing random variables while retaining predictive power over a target variable. Traditional methods like IB are purely statistical and ignore underlying causal structures, making them ill-suited for causal tasks. We propose the Causal Information Bottleneck (CIB), a causal extension of the IB, which compresses a set of chosen variables while maintaining causal control over a target variable. This method produces abstractions of (sets of) variables which are causally interpretable, give us insight about the interactions between the abstracted variables and the target variable, and can be used when reasoning about interventions. We present experimental results demonstrating that the learned abstractions accurately capture causal relations as intended.

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the ability of neural networks to execute algorithmic tasks (e.g., arithmetic, summary statistics, and sorting). The goal of this work is to better understand the role of attention in Transformers for algorithmic execution. Its importance for algorithmic execution has been studied theoretically and empirically using parallel computational models. Notably, many parallel algorithms communicate between processors solely using positional information. Inspired by this observation, we investigate how Transformers can execute algorithms using positional attention, where attention weights depend exclusively on positional encodings. We prove that Transformers with positional attention (positional Transformers) maintain the same expressivity of parallel computational models, incurring a logarithmic depth cost relative to the input length. We analyze their in-distribution learnability and explore how parameter norms in positional attention affect sample complexity. Our results show that positional Transformers introduce a learning trade-off: while they exhibit better theoretical dependence on parameter norms, certain tasks may require more layers, which can, in turn, increase sample complexity. Finally, we empirically explore the out-of-distribution performance of positional Transformers and find that they perform well in tasks where their underlying algorithmic solution relies on positional information.

<title>Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Audio Captioning with Generation-Assisted Multimodal Querying and Progressive Learning</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation can improve audio captioning by incorporating relevant audio-text pairs from a knowledge base. Existing methods typically rely solely on the input audio as a unimodal retrieval query. In contrast, we propose Generation-Assisted Multimodal Querying, which generates a text description of the input audio to enable multimodal querying. This approach aligns the query modality with the audio-text structure of the knowledge base, leading to more effective retrieval. Furthermore, we introduce a novel progressive learning strategy that gradually increases the number of interleaved audio-text pairs to enhance the training process. Our experiments on AudioCaps, Clotho, and Auto-ACD demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across these benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. FlickerFusion stochastically drops out parts of the observation space, emulating being in-domain when inferenced OOD. The results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. Benchmarks, implementations, and model weights are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.

<title>xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): You Only Need 32 Tokens to Represent a Video Even in VLMs</title>

Abstract: We present xGen-MM-Vid (BLIP-3-Video): a multimodal language model for videos, particularly designed to efficiently capture temporal information over multiple frames. BLIP-3-Video takes advantage of the 'temporal encoder' in addition to the conventional visual tokenizer, which maps a sequence of tokens over multiple frames into a compact set of visual tokens. This enables BLIP3-Video to use much fewer visual tokens than its competing models (e.g., 32 vs. 4608 tokens). We explore different types of temporal encoders, including learnable spatio-temporal pooling as well as sequential models like Token Turing Machines. We experimentally confirm that BLIP-3-Video obtains video question-answering accuracies comparable to much larger state-of-the-art models (e.g., 34B), while being much smaller (i.e., 4B) and more efficient by using fewer visual tokens.

Abstract: We present a prosody-guided framework for speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) that aligns and translates speech \emph{without} transcripts by leveraging cross-linguistic pause synchrony. Analyzing a 6{,}000-hour East African news corpus spanning five languages, we show that \emph{within-phylum} language pairs exhibit 30--40\% lower pause variance and over 3$\times$ higher onset/offset correlation compared to cross-phylum pairs. These findings motivate \textbf{SPaDA}, a dynamic-programming alignment algorithm that integrates silence consistency, rate synchrony, and semantic similarity. SPaDA improves alignment $F_1$ by +3--4 points and eliminates up to 38\% of spurious matches relative to greedy VAD baselines. Using SPaDA-aligned segments, we train \textbf{SegUniDiff}, a diffusion-based S2ST model guided by \emph{external gradients} from frozen semantic and speaker encoders. SegUniDiff matches an enhanced cascade in BLEU (30.3 on CVSS-C vs.\ 28.9 for UnitY), reduces speaker error rate (EER) from 12.5\% to 5.3\%, and runs at an RTF of 1.02. To support evaluation in low-resource settings, we also release a three-tier, transcript-free BLEU suite (M1--M3) that correlates strongly with human judgments. Together, our results show that prosodic cues in multilingual speech provide a reliable scaffold for scalable, non-autoregressive S2ST.

<title>Length-Induced Embedding Collapse in PLM-based Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24200</link>

Abstract: Text embeddings from PLM-based models enable a wide range of applications, yet their performance often degrades on longer texts. In this paper, we introduce a phenomenon we call Length Collapse, where embeddings of longer texts tend to cluster together. This clustering results in a distributional inconsistency between the embeddings of short and long texts. We further investigate how these differences contribute to the performance decline observed with longer texts across various downstream tasks. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis of the self-attention mechanism, which acts as a low-pass filter in PLM-based models, we demonstrate that as text length increases, the strength of low-pass filtering intensifies, causing embeddings to retain more low-frequency components. As a result, input token features become more similar, leading to clustering and ultimately the collapse of embeddings for longer texts. To address this issue, we propose a simple method, TempScale, which mitigates the Length Collapse phenomenon. By narrowing the gap in low-pass filtering rates between long and short texts, TempScale ensures more consistent embeddings across different text lengths. This approach leads to performance improvements of 0.94% on MTEB and 1.10% on LongEmbed, which focuses specifically on long-context retrieval, providing strong evidence for the validity of our analysis. The source code is available at https://github.com/Yuqi-Zhou/Length_Collapse.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their knowledge and generative capabilities, leading to a surge of interest in leveraging LLMs for high-quality data synthesis. However, synthetic data generation via prompting LLMs remains challenging due to LLMs' limited understanding of target data distributions and the complexity of prompt engineering, especially for structured formatted data. To address these issues, we introduce DiffLM, a controllable data synthesis framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE), which further (1) leverages diffusion models to reserve more information of original distribution and format structure in the learned latent distribution and (2) decouples the learning of target distribution knowledge from the LLM's generative objectives via a plug-and-play latent feature injection module. As we observed significant discrepancies between the VAE's latent representations and the real data distribution, the latent diffusion module is introduced into our framework to learn a fully expressive latent distribution. Evaluations on seven real-world datasets with structured formatted data (i.e., Tabular, Code, and Tool data) demonstrate that DiffLM generates high-quality data, with performance on downstream tasks surpassing that of real data by 2%-7% in certain cases. Data and code are available at https://github.com/bytedance/DiffLM.

Abstract: Despite the utility that Generative AI (GenAI) tools provide for tasks such as writing code, the use of these tools raises important legal questions and potential risks, particularly those associated with copyright law. As lawmakers and regulators engage with those questions, the views of users can provide relevant perspectives. In this paper, we provide: (1) a survey of 574 developers on the licensing and copyright aspects of GenAI for coding, as well as follow-up interviews; (2) a snapshot of developers' views at a time when GenAI and perceptions of it are rapidly evolving; and (3) an analysis of developers' views, yielding insights and recommendations that can inform future regulatory decisions in this evolving field. Our results show the benefits developers derive from GenAI, how they view the use of AI-generated code as similar to using other existing code, the varied opinions they have on who should own or be compensated for such code, that they are concerned about data leakage via GenAI, and much more, providing organizations and policymakers with valuable insights into how the technology is being used and what concerns stakeholders would like to see addressed.

Abstract: What can we learn about language from studying how it is used by ChatGPT and other large language model (LLM)-based chatbots? In this paper, we analyse the distinctive character of language generated by ChatGPT, in relation to questions raised by natural language processing pioneer, and student of Wittgenstein, Margaret Masterman. Following frequent complaints that LLM-based chatbots produce "slop," or even "bullshit," in the sense of Frankfurt's popular monograph On Bullshit, we conduct an empirical study to contrast the language of 1,000 scientific publications with typical text generated by ChatGPT. We then explore whether the same language features can be detected in two well-known contexts of social dysfunction: George Orwell's critique of political speech, and David Graeber's characterisation of bullshit jobs. Using simple hypothesis-testing methods, we demonstrate that a statistical model of sloppy bullshit can reliably relate the Frankfurtian artificial bullshit of ChatGPT to the political and workplace functions of bullshit as observed in natural human language.

arXiv:2411.19339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple, training-free mechanism which explains the generalization behaviour of diffusion models. By comparing pre-trained diffusion models to their theoretically optimal empirical counterparts, we identify a shared local inductive bias across a variety of network architectures. From this observation, we hypothesize that network denoisers generalize through localized denoising operations, as these operations approximate the training objective well over much of the training distribution. To validate our hypothesis, we introduce novel denoising algorithms which aggregate local empirical denoisers to replicate network behaviour. Comparing these algorithms to network denoisers across forward and reverse diffusion processes, our approach exhibits consistent visual similarity to neural network outputs, with lower mean squared error than previously proposed methods.

Abstract: Performative prediction is a framework accounting for the shift in the data distribution induced by the prediction of a model deployed in the real world. Ensuring rapid convergence to a stable solution where the data distribution remains the same after the model deployment is crucial, especially in evolving environments. This paper extends the Repeated Risk Minimization (RRM) framework by utilizing historical datasets from previous retraining snapshots, yielding a class of algorithms that we call Affine Risk Minimizers and enabling convergence to a performatively stable point for a broader class of problems. We introduce a new upper bound for methods that use only the final iteration of the dataset and prove for the first time the tightness of both this new bound and the previous existing bounds within the same regime. We also prove that utilizing historical datasets can surpass the lower bound for last iterate RRM, and empirically observe faster convergence to the stable point on various performative prediction benchmarks. We offer at the same time the first lower bound analysis for RRM within the class of Affine Risk Minimizers, quantifying the potential improvements in convergence speed that could be achieved with other variants in our framework.

<title>From Language Models over Tokens to Language Models over Characters</title>

arXiv:2412.03719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern language models are internally -- and mathematically -- distributions over $\it{token}$ strings rather than $\it{character}$ strings, posing numerous challenges for programmers building user applications on top of them. For example, if a prompt is specified as a character string, it must be tokenized before passing it to the token-level language model. Thus, the tokenizer and consequent processing are very sensitive to the specification of the prompt (e.g., whether the prompt ends with a space or not). This paper presents algorithms for converting token-level language models to character-level ones. We present both exact and approximate algorithms. In the empirical portion of the paper, we benchmark the practical runtime and approximation quality. Across four publicly available language models, we find that -- even with a small computation budget -- our method is able to accurately approximate the character-level distribution at reasonably fast speeds, and that a significant improvement in the language model's compression rate (bits/byte) is achieved.

arXiv:2412.04323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reliable deployment of deep reinforcement learning in real-world settings requires the ability to generalize across a variety of conditions, including both in-distribution scenarios seen during training as well as novel out-of-distribution scenarios. In this work, we present a framework for dynamics generalization in deep reinforcement learning that unifies these two distinct types of generalization within a single architecture. We introduce a robust adaptation module that provides a mechanism for identifying and reacting to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution environment dynamics, along with a joint training pipeline that combines the goals of in-distribution adaptation and out-of-distribution robustness. Our algorithm GRAM achieves strong generalization performance across in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios upon deployment, which we demonstrate through extensive simulation and hardware locomotion experiments on a quadruped robot.

Abstract: Given the rapid progress of generative AI, there is a pressing need to systematically compare and choose between the numerous models and configurations available. The scale and versatility of such evaluations make the use of LLM-based judges a compelling solution for this challenge. Crucially, this approach requires first to validate the quality of the LLM judge itself. Previous work has focused on instance-based assessment of LLM judges, where a judge is evaluated over a set of responses, or response pairs, while being agnostic to their source systems. We argue that this setting overlooks critical factors affecting system-level ranking, such as a judge's positive or negative bias towards certain systems. To address this gap, we conduct the first large-scale study of LLM judges as system rankers. System scores are generated by aggregating judgment scores over multiple system outputs, and the judge's quality is assessed by comparing the resulting system ranking to a human-based ranking. Beyond overall judge assessment, our analysis provides a fine-grained characterization of judge behavior, including their decisiveness and bias.

Abstract: We have witnessed the unprecedented success of diffusion-based video generation over the past year. Recently proposed models from the community have wielded the power to generate cinematic and high-resolution videos with smooth motions from arbitrary input prompts. However, as a supertask of image generation, video generation models require more computation and are thus hosted mostly on cloud servers, limiting broader adoption among content creators. In this work, we propose a comprehensive acceleration framework to bring the power of the large-scale video diffusion model to the hands of edge users. From the network architecture scope, we initialize from a compact image backbone and search out the design and arrangement of temporal layers to maximize hardware efficiency. In addition, we propose a dedicated adversarial fine-tuning algorithm for our efficient model and reduce the denoising steps to 4. Our model, with only 0.6B parameters, can generate a 5-second video on an iPhone 16 PM within 5 seconds. Compared to server-side models that take minutes on powerful GPUs to generate a single video, we accelerate the generation by magnitudes while delivering on-par quality.

Abstract: At present, all textual backdoor attack methods are based on single triggers: for example, inserting specific content into the text to activate the backdoor; or changing the abstract text features. The former is easier to be identified by existing defense strategies due to its obvious characteristics; the latter, although improved in invisibility, has certain shortcomings in terms of attack performance, construction of poisoned datasets, and selection of the final poisoning rate. On this basis, this paper innovatively proposes a Dual-Trigger backdoor attack based on syntax and mood, and optimizes the construction of the poisoned dataset and the selection strategy of the final poisoning rate. A large number of experimental results show that this method significantly outperforms the previous methods based on abstract features in attack performance, and achieves comparable attack performance (almost 100% attack success rate) with the insertion-based method. In addition, the two trigger mechanisms included in this method can be activated independently in the application phase of the model, which not only improves the flexibility of the trigger style, but also enhances its robustness against defense strategies. These results profoundly reveal that textual backdoor attacks are extremely harmful and provide a new perspective for security protection in this field.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification (ReID) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in surveillance and security. Despite progress in recent years, most existing ReID models often struggle to generalize across diverse cultural contexts, particularly in Islamic regions like Iran, where modest clothing styles are prevalent. Existing datasets predominantly feature Western and East Asian fashion, limiting their applicability in these settings. To address this gap, we introduce Iran University of Science and Technology Person Re-Identification (IUST_PersonReId), a dataset designed to reflect the unique challenges of ReID in new cultural environments, emphasizing modest attire and diverse scenarios from Iran, including markets, campuses, and mosques. Experiments on IUST_PersonReId with state-of-the-art models, such as Semantic Controllable Self-supervised Learning (SOLIDER) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining Re-Identification (CLIP-ReID), reveal significant performance drops compared to benchmarks like Market1501 and Multi-Scene MultiTime (MSMT17), specifically, SOLIDER shows a drop of 50.75% and 23.01% Mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to Market1501 and MSMT17 respectively, while CLIP-ReID exhibits a drop of 38.09% and 21.74% mAP, highlighting the challenges posed by occlusion and limited distinctive features. Sequence-based evaluations show improvements by leveraging temporal context, emphasizing the dataset's potential for advancing culturally sensitive and robust ReID systems. IUST_PersonReId offers a critical resource for addressing fairness and bias in ReID research globally.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise in aligning generative AI, we present empirical evidence that it can also cause severe, systematic misalignment. We hypothesize that this stems from evaluator feedback depending on downstream outcome predictions (foresight) that can be influenced by the AI's output, inducing Goodhart's law dynamics. We present a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations (hindsight) inhibits this effect by decoupling the alignment signal from potentially compromised predictions--crucially, the result holds even if the observed outcomes are sampled from the AI's own world model. Building on this insight, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which presents plausible simulated outcomes to evaluators before eliciting feedback. We validate RLHS across three consultancy settings--marketplace interactions, restaurant recommendations, and online course advising--using both online (PPO) and offline (DPO) fine-tuning methods, and show that it substantially improves alignment over RLHF in experiments and human evaluations. We perform post-hoc benchmark evaluations on TruthfulQA, HaluEval, and TrustLLM, finding that even after single-task fine-tuning, RLHF misalignment persists, whereas RLHS consistently outperforms baselines and demonstrates robust alignment generalization.

Abstract: With the rapid development of deep reinforcement learning technology, it gradually demonstrates excellent potential and is becoming the most promising solution in the robotics. However, in the smart manufacturing domain, there is still not too much research involved in dynamic adaptive control mechanisms optimizing complex processes. This research advances the integration of Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with digital twins for industrial robotics applications, providing a framework for enhanced adaptive real-time control for smart additive manufacturing processing. The system architecture combines Unity's simulation environment with ROS2 for seamless digital twin synchronization, while leveraging transfer learning to efficiently adapt trained models across tasks. We demonstrate our methodology using a Viper X300s robot arm with the proposed hierarchical reward structure to address the common reinforcement learning challenges in two distinct control scenarios. The results show rapid policy convergence and robust task execution in both simulated and physical environments demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across various domains. Accompanying the evolving capabilities and expanding deployment scenarios of LLMs, their deployment challenges escalate due to their sheer scale and the advanced yet complex activation designs prevalent in notable model series, such as Llama, Gemma, Mistral. These challenges have become particularly pronounced in resource-constrained deployment scenarios, where mitigating inference bottlenecks is imperative. Among various recent efforts, activation approximation has emerged as a promising avenue for pursuing inference efficiency, sometimes considered indispensable in applications such as private inference. Despite achieving substantial speedups with minimal impact on utility, even appearing sound and practical for real-world deployment, the safety implications of activation approximations remain unclear. In this work, we fill this critical gap in LLM safety by conducting the first systematic safety evaluation of activation approximations. Our safety vetting spans seven state-of-the-art techniques across three popular categories (activation polynomialization, activation sparsification, and activation quantization), revealing consistent safety degradation across ten safety-aligned LLMs. To overcome the hurdle of devising a unified defense accounting for diverse activation approximation methods, we perform an in-depth analysis of their shared error patterns and uncover three key findings. We propose QuadA, a novel safety enhancement method tailored to mitigate the safety compromises introduced by activation approximations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies corroborate QuadA's effectiveness in enhancing the safety capabilities of LLMs after activation approximations.

Abstract: Values are core drivers of individual and collective perception, cognition, and behavior. Value systems, such as Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling cross-disciplinary investigations into decision-making and societal dynamics. Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in evaluating, understanding, and aligning LLM values, a psychologically grounded LLM value system remains underexplored. This study addresses the gap by introducing the Generative Psycho-Lexical Approach (GPLA), a scalable, adaptable, and theoretically informed method for constructing value systems. Leveraging GPLA, we propose a psychologically grounded five-factor value system tailored for LLMs. For systematic validation, we present three benchmarking tasks that integrate psychological principles with cutting-edge AI priorities. Our results reveal that the proposed value system meets standard psychological criteria, better captures LLM values, improves LLM safety prediction, and enhances LLM alignment, when compared to the canonical Schwartz's values.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence with capabilities in reasoning, coding, and communication, driving innovation across industries. Their true potential depends on effective alignment to ensure correct, trustworthy and ethical behavior, addressing challenges like misinformation, hallucinations, bias and misuse. While existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based alignment methods are notoriously complex, direct optimization approaches offer a simpler alternative. In this work, we introduce a novel direct optimization approach for LLM alignment by drawing on established Information Retrieval (IR) principles. We present a systematic framework that bridges LLM alignment and IR methodologies, mapping LLM generation and reward models to IR's retriever-reranker paradigm. Building on this foundation, we propose LLM Alignment as Retriever Preference Optimization (LarPO), a new alignment method that enhances overall alignment quality. Extensive experiments validate LarPO's effectiveness with 38.9 % and 13.7 % averaged improvement on AlpacaEval2 and MixEval-Hard respectively. Our work opens new avenues for advancing LLM alignment by integrating IR foundations, offering a promising direction for future research.

<title>In Praise of Stubbornness: An Empirical Case for Cognitive-Dissonance Aware Continual Update of Knowledge in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Through systematic empirical investigation, we uncover a fundamental and concerning property of Large Language Models: while they can safely learn facts that don't contradict their knowledge, attempting to update facts with contradictory information triggers catastrophic corruption of unrelated knowledge. Unlike humans, who naturally resist contradictory information, these models indiscriminately accept contradictions, leading to devastating interference, destroying up to 80% of unrelated knowledge even when learning as few as 10-100 contradicting facts. To understand whether this interference could be mitigated through selective plasticity, we experiment with targeted network updates, distinguishing between previously used (stubborn) and rarely used (plastic) neurons. We uncover another asymmetry: while sparing frequently-used neurons significantly improves retention of existing knowledge for non-contradictory updates (98% vs 93% with standard updates), contradictory updates trigger catastrophic interference regardless of targeting strategy. This effect which persists across tested model scales (GPT-2 to GPT-J-6B), suggests a fundamental limitation in how neural networks handle contradictions. Finally, we demonstrate that contradictory information can be reliably detected (95%+ accuracy) using simple model features, offering a potential protective mechanism. These findings motivate new architectures that can, like humans, naturally resist contradictions rather than allowing destructive overwrites.

Abstract: Simulating complex physical systems is crucial for understanding and predicting phenomena across diverse fields, such as fluid dynamics and heat transfer, as well as plasma physics and structural mechanics. Traditional approaches rely on solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using numerical methods, which are computationally expensive and often prohibitively slow for real-time applications or large-scale simulations. Neural PDEs have emerged as efficient alternatives to these costly numerical solvers, offering significant computational speed-ups. However, their lack of robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) limits deployment in critical applications. We introduce a model-agnostic, physics-informed conformal prediction (CP) framework that provides guaranteed uncertainty estimates without requiring labelled data. By utilising a physics-based approach, we can quantify and calibrate the model's inconsistencies with the physics rather than the uncertainty arising from the data. Our approach utilises convolutional layers as finite-difference stencils and leverages physics residual errors as nonconformity scores, enabling data-free UQ with marginal and joint coverage guarantees across prediction domains for a range of complex PDEs. We further validate the efficacy of our method on neural PDE models for plasma modelling and shot design in fusion reactors.

Abstract: We present an Adversarially Pre-trained Transformer (APT) that is able to perform zero-shot meta-learning on tabular prediction tasks without pre-training on any real-world dataset, extending on the recent development of Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) and TabPFN. Specifically, APT is pre-trained with adversarial synthetic data agents, who continue to shift their underlying data generating distribution and deliberately challenge the model with different synthetic datasets. In addition, we propose a mixture block architecture that is able to handle classification tasks with arbitrary number of classes, addressing the class size limitation -- a crucial weakness of prior deep tabular zero-shot learners. In experiments, we show that our framework matches state-of-the-art performance on small classification tasks without filtering on dataset characteristics such as number of classes and number of missing values, while maintaining an average runtime under one second. On common benchmark dataset suites in both classification and regression, we show that adversarial pre-training was able to enhance TabPFN's performance. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the adversarial synthetic data agents were able to generate a more diverse collection of data compared to the ordinary random generator in TabPFN. In addition, we demonstrate that our mixture block neural design has improved generalizability and greatly accelerated pre-training.

<title>Accelerating LLM Inference with Lossless Speculative Decoding Algorithms for Heterogeneous Vocabularies</title>

arXiv:2502.05202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) methods offer substantial efficiency gains by generating multiple tokens using a single target forward pass. However, existing SD approaches require the drafter and target models to share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the pool of possible drafters, often necessitating the training of a drafter from scratch. We present three new SD methods that remove this shared-vocabulary constraint. All three methods preserve the target distribution (i.e., they are lossless) and work with off-the-shelf models without requiring additional training or modifications. Empirically, on summarization, programming, and long-context tasks, our algorithms demonstrate significant speedups of up to 2.8x over standard autoregressive decoding. By enabling any off-the-shelf model to serve as a drafter and requiring no retraining, this work substantially broadens the applicability of the SD framework in practice.

<title>Lightweight Dataset Pruning without Full Training via Example Difficulty and Prediction Uncertainty</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06905</link>

arXiv:2502.06905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning rely heavily on massive datasets, leading to substantial storage and training costs. Dataset pruning aims to alleviate this demand by discarding redundant examples. However, many existing methods require training a model with a full dataset over a large number of epochs before being able to prune the dataset, which ironically makes the pruning process more expensive than just training the model on the entire dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Difficulty and Uncertainty-Aware Lightweight (DUAL) score, which aims to identify important samples from the early training stage by considering both example difficulty and prediction uncertainty. To address a catastrophic accuracy drop at an extreme pruning, we further propose a ratio-adaptive sampling using Beta distribution. Experiments on various datasets and learning scenarios such as image classification with label noise and image corruption, and model architecture generalization demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Specifically, on ImageNet-1k, our method reduces the time cost for pruning to 66% compared to previous methods while achieving a SOTA, specifically 60% test accuracy at a 90% pruning ratio. On CIFAR datasets, the time cost is reduced to just 15% while maintaining SOTA performance.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a modular approach for the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) task by decomposing the problem into four sub-modules that use state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in a zero-shot setting. Given navigation instruction in natural language, we first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names, which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches that use joint semantic maps like VLMaps on the complex R2R-Habitat instruction dataset and quantify in detail the effect of visual grounding on navigation performance.

Abstract: Time series modeling and analysis have become critical in various domains. Conventional methods such as RNNs and Transformers, while effective for discrete-time and regularly sampled data, face significant challenges in capturing the continuous dynamics and irregular sampling patterns inherent in real-world scenarios. Neural Differential Equations (NDEs) represent a paradigm shift by combining the flexibility of neural networks with the mathematical rigor of differential equations. This paper presents a comprehensive review of NDE-based methods for time series analysis, including neural ordinary differential equations, neural controlled differential equations, and neural stochastic differential equations. We provide a detailed discussion of their mathematical formulations, numerical methods, and applications, highlighting their ability to model continuous-time dynamics. Furthermore, we address key challenges and future research directions. This survey serves as a foundation for researchers and practitioners seeking to leverage NDEs for advanced time series analysis.

Abstract: Memory is crucial for enabling agents to tackle complex tasks with temporal and spatial dependencies. While many reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms incorporate memory, the field lacks a universal benchmark to assess an agent's memory capabilities across diverse scenarios. This gap is particularly evident in tabletop robotic manipulation, where memory is essential for solving tasks with partial observability and ensuring robust performance, yet no standardized benchmarks exist. To address this, we introduce MIKASA (Memory-Intensive Skills Assessment Suite for Agents), a comprehensive benchmark for memory RL, with three key contributions: (1) we propose a comprehensive classification framework for memory-intensive RL tasks, (2) we collect MIKASA-Base -- a unified benchmark that enables systematic evaluation of memory-enhanced agents across diverse scenarios, and (3) we develop MIKASA-Robo (pip install mikasa-robo-suite) -- a novel benchmark of 32 carefully designed memory-intensive tasks that assess memory capabilities in tabletop robotic manipulation. Our work introduces a unified framework to advance memory RL research, enabling more robust systems for real-world use. MIKASA is available at https://tinyurl.com/membenchrobots.

Abstract: First-order model counting (FOMC) is the problem of counting the number of models of a sentence in first-order logic. Since lifted inference techniques rely on reductions to variants of FOMC, the design of scalable methods for FOMC has attracted attention from both theoreticians and practitioners over the past decade. Recently, a new approach based on first-order knowledge compilation was proposed. This approach, called Crane, instead of simply providing the final count, generates definitions of (possibly recursive) functions that can be evaluated with different arguments to compute the model count for any domain size. However, this approach is not fully automated, as it requires manual evaluation of the constructed functions. The primary contribution of this work is a fully automated compilation algorithm, called Crane2, which transforms the function definitions into C++ code equipped with arbitrary-precision arithmetic. These additions allow the new FOMC algorithm to scale to domain sizes over 500,000 times larger than the current state of the art, as demonstrated through experimental results.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly explored for their energy efficiency and robustness in real-world applications, yet their privacy risks remain largely unexamined. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility of SNNs to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) -- a major privacy threat where an adversary attempts to determine whether a given sample was part of the training dataset. While prior work suggests that SNNs may offer inherent robustness due to their discrete, event-driven nature, we find that its resilience diminishes as latency (T) increases. Furthermore, we introduce an input dropout strategy under black box setting, that significantly enhances membership inference in SNNs. Our findings challenge the assumption that SNNs are inherently more secure, and even though they are expected to be better, our results reveal that SNNs exhibit privacy vulnerabilities that are equally comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MIA_SNN-3610.

Abstract: Patients have long sought health information online, and increasingly, they are turning to generative AI to answer their health-related queries. Given the high stakes of the medical domain, techniques like retrieval-augmented generation and citation grounding have been widely promoted as methods to reduce hallucinations and improve the accuracy of AI-generated responses and have been widely adopted into search engines. This paper argues that even when these methods produce literally accurate content drawn from source documents sans hallucinations, they can still be highly misleading. Patients may derive significantly different interpretations from AI-generated outputs than they would from reading the original source material, let alone consulting a knowledgeable clinician. Through a large-scale query analysis on topics including disputed diagnoses and procedure safety, we support our argument with quantitative and qualitative evidence of the suboptimal answers resulting from current systems. In particular, we highlight how these models tend to decontextualize facts, omit critical relevant sources, and reinforce patient misconceptions or biases. We propose a series of recommendations -- such as the incorporation of communication pragmatics and enhanced comprehension of source documents -- that could help mitigate these issues and extend beyond the medical domain.

Abstract: Which large language model (LLM) is better? Every evaluation tells a story, but what do users really think about current LLMs? This paper presents CLUE, an LLM-powered interviewer that conducts in-the-moment user experience interviews, right after users interact with LLMs, and automatically gathers insights about user opinions from massive interview logs. We conduct a study with thousands of users to understand user opinions on mainstream LLMs, recruiting users to first chat with a target LLM and then be interviewed by CLUE. Our experiments demonstrate that CLUE captures interesting user opinions, e.g., the bipolar views on the displayed reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1 and demands for information freshness and multi-modality.

arXiv:2502.15794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Transformer-based framework for Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). CSPs find use in many applications and thus accelerating their solution with machine learning is of wide interest. Most existing approaches rely on supervised learning from feasible solutions or reinforcement learning, paradigms that require either feasible solutions to these NP-Complete CSPs or large training budgets and a complex expert-designed reward signal. To address these challenges, we propose ConsFormer, a self-supervised framework that leverages a Transformer as a solution refiner. ConsFormer constructs a solution to a CSP iteratively in a process that mimics local search. Instead of using feasible solutions as labeled data, we devise differentiable approximations to the discrete constraints of a CSP to guide model training. Our model is trained to improve random assignments for a single step but is deployed iteratively at test time, circumventing the bottlenecks of supervised and reinforcement learning. Experiments on Sudoku, Graph Coloring, Nurse Rostering, and MAXCUT demonstrate that our method can tackle out-of-distribution CSPs simply through additional iterations.

arXiv:2502.18462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable sampling of molecular states in thermodynamic equilibrium is a long-standing challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann generators tackle this problem by pairing normalizing flows with importance sampling to obtain uncorrelated samples under the target distribution. In this paper, we extend the Boltzmann generator framework with two key contributions, denoting our framework Sequential Boltzmann Generators (SBG). The first is a highly efficient Transformer-based normalizing flow operating directly on all-atom Cartesian coordinates. In contrast to the equivariant continuous flows of prior methods, we leverage exactly invertible non-equivariant architectures which are highly efficient during both sample generation and likelihood evaluation. This efficiency unlocks more sophisticated inference strategies beyond standard importance sampling. In particular, we perform inference-time scaling of flow samples using a continuous-time variant of sequential Monte Carlo, in which flow samples are transported towards the target distribution with annealed Langevin dynamics. SBG achieves state-of-the-art performance w.r.t. all metrics on peptide systems, demonstrating the first equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of tri-, tetra- and hexa-peptides that were thus far intractable for prior Boltzmann generators.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has enabled large language models (LLMs) to utilize additional computation through intermediate tokens to solve complex tasks. However, we posit that typical reasoning traces contain many redundant tokens, incurring extraneous inference costs. Upon examination of the output distribution of current LLMs, we find evidence on their latent ability to reason more concisely, relative to their default behavior. To elicit this capability, we propose simple fine-tuning methods which leverage self-generated concise reasoning paths obtained by best-of-N sampling and few-shot conditioning, in task-specific settings. Our combined method achieves a 30% reduction in output tokens on average, across five model families on GSM8K and MATH, while maintaining average accuracy. By exploiting the fundamental stochasticity and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs, our self-training approach robustly elicits concise reasoning on a wide range of models, including those with extensive post-training.

Abstract: Causal reasoning and compositional reasoning are two core aspirations in AI. Measuring the extent of these behaviors requires principled evaluation methods. We explore a unified perspective that considers both behaviors simultaneously, termed compositional causal reasoning (CCR): the ability to infer how causal measures compose and, equivalently, how causal quantities propagate through graphs. We instantiate a framework for the systematic evaluation of CCR for the average treatment effect and the probability of necessity and sufficiency. As proof of concept, we demonstrate CCR evaluation for language models in the LLama, Phi, and GPT families. On a math word problem, our framework revealed a range of taxonomically distinct error patterns. CCR errors increased with the complexity of causal paths for all models except o1.

arXiv:2503.05816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formal economic framework to analyze whether neural scaling laws in artificial intelligence will activate Jevons' Paradox in labor markets, potentially leading to increased AI adoption and human labor substitution. By using a time-varying elasticity of substitution (VES) approach, we establish analytical conditions under which AI systems transition from complementing to substituting for human labor. Our model formalizes four interconnected mechanisms: (1) exponential growth in computational capacity ($C(t) = C(0) \cdot e^{g \cdot t}$); (2) logarithmic scaling of AI capabilities with computation ($\sigma(t) = \delta \cdot \ln(C(t)/C(0))$); (3) declining AI prices ($p_A(t) = p_A(0) \cdot e^{-d \cdot t}$); and (4) a resulting compound effect parameter ($\phi = \delta \cdot g$) that governs market transformation dynamics. We identify five distinct phases of AI market penetration, demonstrating that complete market transformation requires the elasticity of substitution to exceed unity ($\sigma > 1$), with the timing determined primarily by the compound parameter $\phi$ rather than price competition alone. These findings provide an analytical framing for evaluating industry claims about AI substitution effects, especially on the role of quality versus price in the technological transition.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) browser assistants integrate powerful capabilities of GenAI in web browsers to provide rich experiences such as question answering, content summarization, and agentic navigation. These assistants, available today as browser extensions, can not only track detailed browsing activity such as search and click data, but can also autonomously perform tasks such as filling forms, raising significant privacy concerns. It is crucial to understand the design and operation of GenAI browser extensions, including how they collect, store, process, and share user data. To this end, we study their ability to profile users and personalize their responses based on explicit or inferred demographic attributes and interests of users. We perform network traffic analysis and use a novel prompting framework to audit tracking, profiling, and personalization by the ten most popular GenAI browser assistant extensions. We find that instead of relying on local in-browser models, these assistants largely depend on server-side APIs, which can be auto-invoked without explicit user interaction. When invoked, they collect and share webpage content, often the full HTML DOM and sometimes even the user's form inputs, with their first-party servers. Some assistants also share identifiers and user prompts with third-party trackers such as Google Analytics. The collection and sharing continues even if a webpage contains sensitive information such as health or personal information such as name or SSN entered in a web form. We find that several GenAI browser assistants infer demographic attributes such as age, gender, income, and interests and use this profile--which carries across browsing contexts--to personalize responses. In summary, our work shows that GenAI browser assistants can and do collect personal and sensitive information for profiling and personalization with little to no safeguards.

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are widely used for their strong asymptotic performance and training stability, but they struggle to scale with larger batch sizes, as additional parallel environments yield redundant data due to limited policy-induced diversity. In contrast, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) scale naturally and encourage exploration via randomized population-based search, but are often sample-inefficient. We propose Evolutionary Policy Optimization (EPO), a hybrid algorithm that combines the scalability and diversity of EAs with the performance and stability of policy gradients. EPO maintains a population of agents conditioned on latent variables, shares actor-critic network parameters for coherence and memory efficiency, and aggregates diverse experiences into a master agent. Across tasks in dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and classic control, EPO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and scalability.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) are emerging as a compelling alternative to Transformers because of their consistent memory usage and high performance. Despite this, scaling up SSMs on cloud services or limited-resource devices is challenging due to their storage requirements and computational power. To overcome this, quantizing SSMs with low bit-width data formats can reduce model size and benefit from hardware acceleration. As SSMs are prone to quantization-induced errors, recent efforts have focused on optimizing a particular model or bit-width for efficiency without sacrificing performance. However, distinct bit-width configurations are essential for different scenarios, like W4A8 for boosting large-batch decoding speed, and W4A16 for enhancing generation speed in short prompt applications for a single user. To this end, we present Quamba2, compatible with W8A8, W4A8, and W4A16 for both Mamba1 and Mamba2 backbones, addressing the growing demand for SSM deployment on various platforms. Based on the channel order preserving and activation persistence of SSMs, we propose an offline approach to quantize inputs of a linear recurrence in 8-bit by sorting and clustering for input $x$, combined with a per-state-group quantization for input-dependent parameters $B$ and $C$. To ensure compute-invariance in the SSM output, we rearrange weights offline according to the clustering sequence. The experiments show that Quamba2-8B outperforms two state-of-the-art SSM quantization methods and delivers 1.3$\times$ and 3$\times$ speed-ups in the pre-filling and generation stages, respectively, while offering 4$\times$ memory reduction with only a $1.6\%$ average accuracy drop. The evaluation on MMLU shows the generalizability and robustness of our framework. The code and quantized models will be released at: https://github.com/enyac-group/Quamba.

Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) focuses on identifying whether observations in streaming data deviate significantly from normal patterns. With the prevalence of connected devices, anomaly detection on time series has become paramount, as it enables real-time monitoring and early detection of irregular behaviors across various application domains. In this work, we introduce PatchTrAD, a Patch-based Transformer model for time series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a Transformer encoder along with the use of patches under a reconstructionbased framework for anomaly detection. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets show that PatchTrAD is on par, in terms of detection performance, with state-of-the-art deep learning models for anomaly detection while being time efficient during inference.

<title>On Large-scale Evaluation of Embedding Models for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models are extensively studied for knowledge graph completion, yet their evaluation remains constrained by unrealistic benchmarks. Standard evaluation metrics rely on the closed-world assumption, which penalizes models for correctly predicting missing triples, contradicting the fundamental goals of link prediction. These metrics often compress accuracy assessment into a single value, obscuring models' specific strengths and weaknesses. The prevailing evaluation protocol, link prediction, operates under the unrealistic assumption that an entity's properties, for which values are to be predicted, are known in advance. While alternative protocols such as property prediction, entity-pair ranking, and triple classification address some of these limitations, they remain underutilized. Moreover, commonly used datasets are either faulty or too small to reflect real-world data. Few studies examine the role of mediator nodes, which are essential for modeling n-ary relationships, or investigate model performance variation across domains. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of four representative KGE models on large-scale datasets FB-CVT-REV and FB+CVT-REV. Our analysis reveals critical insights, including substantial performance variations between small and large datasets, both in relative rankings and absolute metrics, systematic overestimation of model capabilities when n-ary relations are binarized, and fundamental limitations in current evaluation protocols and metrics.

<title>Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics</title>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin. To address this problem, we propose Activated LoRA (aLoRA), an adapter architecture which modifies the LoRA framework to only adapt weights for the tokens in the sequence \emph{after} the aLoRA is invoked. This change crucially allows aLoRA to accept the base model's KV cache of the input string, meaning that aLoRA can be instantly activated whenever needed in a chain without recomputing the cache. This enables building what we call \emph{intrinsics}, i.e. specialized models invoked to perform well-defined operations on portions of an input chain or conversation that otherwise uses the base model by default. We train a set of aLoRA-based intrinsics models, demonstrating competitive accuracy with standard LoRA while achieving significant inference benefits. The codebase is at https://github.com/IBM/activated-lora.

Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Genetic Algorithm technique, which optimizes neural networks for binary image classification tasks, such as cat vs. non-cat classification. The proposed method employs only two individuals for crossover, represented by two parameter sets: Leader and Follower. The Leader focuses on exploitation, representing the primary optimal solution, while the Follower promotes exploration by preserving diversity and avoiding premature convergence. Leader and Follower are modeled as two phases or roles. The key contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a self-adaptive layer dimension mechanism that eliminates the need for manual tuning of layer architectures; (2) generates two parameter sets, leader and follower parameter sets, with 10 layer architecture configurations (5 for each set), ranked by Pareto dominance and cost post-optimization; and (3) achieved better results compared to gradient-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves 99.04% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.06) on a three-layer network with architecture [12288, 17, 4, 1], higher performance a gradient-based approach that achieves 98% training accuracy and 80% testing accuracy (cost = 0.092) on a four-layer network with architecture [12288, 20, 7, 5, 1].

Abstract: Visual storytelling is an interdisciplinary field combining computer vision and natural language processing to generate cohesive narratives from sequences of images. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages recent advancements in multimodal models, specifically adapting transformer-based architectures and large multimodal models, for the visual storytelling task. Leveraging the large-scale Visual Storytelling (VIST) dataset, our VIST-GPT model produces visually grounded, contextually appropriate narratives. We address the limitations of traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CIDEr, which are not suitable for this task. Instead, we utilize RoViST and GROOVIST, novel reference-free metrics designed to assess visual storytelling, focusing on visual grounding, coherence, and non-redundancy. These metrics provide a more nuanced evaluation of narrative quality, aligning closely with human judgment.

<title>Doxing via the Lens: Revealing Location-related Privacy Leakage on Multi-modal Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have shown significant ability to interpret complex visual content. While these models enable impressive reasoning capabilities, they also introduce novel and underexplored privacy risks. In this paper, we identify a novel category of privacy leakage in MLRMs: Adversaries can infer sensitive geolocation information, such as a user's home address or neighborhood, from user-generated images, including selfies captured in private settings. To formalize and evaluate these risks, we propose a three-level visual privacy risk framework that categorizes image content based on contextual sensitivity and potential for location inference. We further introduce DoxBench, a curated dataset of 500 real-world images reflecting diverse privacy scenarios. Our evaluation across 11 advanced MLRMs and MLLMs demonstrates that these models consistently outperform non-expert humans in geolocation inference and can effectively leak location-related private information. This significantly lowers the barrier for adversaries to obtain users' sensitive geolocation information. We further analyze and identify two primary factors contributing to this vulnerability: (1) MLRMs exhibit strong reasoning capabilities by leveraging visual clues in combination with their internal world knowledge; and (2) MLRMs frequently rely on privacy-related visual clues for inference without any built-in mechanisms to suppress or avoid such usage. To better understand and demonstrate real-world attack feasibility, we propose GeoMiner, a collaborative attack framework that decomposes the prediction process into two stages: clue extraction and reasoning to improve geolocation performance while introducing a novel attack perspective. Our findings highlight the urgent need to reassess inference-time privacy risks in MLRMs to better protect users' sensitive information.

Abstract: Gradient-based bilevel optimisation is a powerful technique with applications in hyperparameter optimisation, task adaptation, algorithm discovery, meta-learning more broadly, and beyond. It often requires differentiating through the gradient-based optimisation itself, leading to "gradient-of-a-gradient" calculations with computationally expensive second-order and mixed derivatives. While modern automatic differentiation libraries provide a convenient way to write programs for calculating these derivatives, they oftentimes cannot fully exploit the specific structure of these problems out-of-the-box, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we analyse such cases and propose Mixed-Flow Meta-Gradients, or MixFlow-MG -- a practical algorithm that uses mixed-mode differentiation to construct more efficient and scalable computational graphs yielding over 10x memory and up to 25% wall-clock time improvements over standard implementations in modern meta-learning setups.

<title>Value Portrait: Assessing Language Models' Values through Psychometrically and Ecologically Valid Items</title>

Abstract: The importance of benchmarks for assessing the values of language models has been pronounced due to the growing need of more authentic, human-aligned responses. However, existing benchmarks rely on human or machine annotations that are vulnerable to value-related biases. Furthermore, the tested scenarios often diverge from real-world contexts in which models are commonly used to generate text and express values. To address these issues, we propose the Value Portrait benchmark, a reliable framework for evaluating LLMs' value orientations with two key characteristics. First, the benchmark consists of items that capture real-life user-LLM interactions, enhancing the relevance of assessment results to real-world LLM usage. Second, each item is rated by human subjects based on its similarity to their own thoughts, and correlations between these ratings and the subjects' actual value scores are derived. This psychometrically validated approach ensures that items strongly correlated with specific values serve as reliable items for assessing those values. Through evaluating 44 LLMs with our benchmark, we find that these models prioritize Benevolence, Security, and Self-Direction values while placing less emphasis on Tradition, Power, and Achievement values. Also, our analysis reveals biases in how LLMs perceive various demographic groups, deviating from real human data.

Abstract: Finding the optimal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) configuration for a given use case can be complex and expensive. Motivated by this challenge, frameworks for RAG hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) have recently emerged, yet their effectiveness has not been rigorously benchmarked. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study involving 5 HPO algorithms over 5 datasets from diverse domains, including a new one collected for this work on real-world product documentation. Our study explores the largest HPO search space considered to date, with three evaluation metrics as optimization targets. Analysis of the results shows that RAG HPO can be done efficiently, either greedily or with random search, and that it significantly boosts RAG performance for all datasets. For greedy HPO approaches, we show that optimizing model selection first is preferable to the prevalent practice of optimizing according to RAG pipeline order.

<title>Efficient Fine-Tuning of Quantized Models via Adaptive Rank and Bitwidth</title>

Abstract: QLoRA effectively combines low-bit quantization and LoRA to achieve memory-friendly fine-tuning for large language models (LLM). Recently, methods based on SVD for continuous update iterations to initialize LoRA matrices to accommodate quantization errors have generally failed to consistently improve performance. Dynamic mixed precision is a natural idea for continuously improving the fine-tuning performance of quantized models, but previous methods often optimize low-rank subspaces or quantization components separately, without considering their synergy. To address this, we propose \textbf{QR-Adaptor}, a unified, gradient-free strategy that uses partial calibration data to jointly search the quantization components and the rank of low-rank spaces for each layer, thereby continuously improving model performance. QR-Adaptor does not minimize quantization error but treats precision and rank allocation as a discrete optimization problem guided by actual downstream performance and memory usage. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) quantized LoRA fine-tuning methods, our approach achieves a 4.89\% accuracy improvement on GSM8K, and in some cases even outperforms the 16-bit fine-tuned model while maintaining the memory footprint of the 4-bit setting.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has provided significant support and opportunities for the advancement of domain-specific LLMs. However, fine-tuning these large models using Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) data inevitably faces challenges such as bias, incorrect knowledge inheritance, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.

Abstract: The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint, ensuring stable training. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for an 1.5B model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly aligned with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Among RLHF methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has gained attention for its simplicity and strong performance, notably eliminating the need for a learned value function. However, GRPO implicitly assumes a balanced domain distribution and uniform semantic alignment across groups - assumptions that rarely hold in real-world datasets. When applied to multi-domain, imbalanced data, GRPO disproportionately optimizes for dominant domains, neglecting underrepresented ones and resulting in poor generalization and fairness. We propose Domain-Informed Self-Consistency Policy Optimization (DISCO), a principled extension to GRPO that addresses inter-group imbalance with two key innovations. Domain-aware reward scaling counteracts frequency bias by reweighting optimization based on domain prevalence. Difficulty-aware reward scaling leverages prompt-level self-consistency to identify and prioritize uncertain prompts that offer greater learning value. Together, these strategies promote more equitable and effective policy learning across domains. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and skewed training distributions show that DISCO improves generalization, outperforms existing GRPO variants by 5% on Qwen3 models, and sets new state-of-the-art results on multi-domain alignment benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in volumetric medical images is crucial for clinical applications, including disease monitoring and cancer treatment planning. Contemporary interactive segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) and its medical variant (MedSAM-2), rely on manually provided prompts like bounding boxes and mouse clicks. In this study, we introduce eye gaze as a novel informational modality for interactive segmentation, marking the application of eye-tracking for 3D medical image segmentation. We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data. Compared to bounding boxes, gaze-based prompts offer a time-efficient interaction approach with slightly lower segmentation quality. Our findings highlight the potential of using gaze as a complementary input modality for interactive 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models exhibit In-Context Learning (ICL), where predictions are made adaptively based on context. While prior work links induction heads to ICL through a sudden jump in accuracy, this can only account for ICL when the answer is included within the context. However, an important property of practical ICL in large language models is the ability to meta-learn how to solve tasks from context, rather than just copying answers from context; how such an ability is obtained during training is largely unexplored. In this paper, we experimentally clarify how such meta-learning ability is acquired by analyzing the dynamics of the model's circuit during training. Specifically, we extend the copy task from previous research into an In-Context Meta Learning setting, where models must infer a task from examples to answer queries. Interestingly, in this setting, we find that there are multiple phases in the process of acquiring such abilities, and that a unique circuit emerges in each phase, contrasting with the single-phases change in induction heads. The emergence of such circuits can be related to several phenomena known in large language models, and our analysis lead to a deeper understanding of the source of the transformer's ICL ability.

Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design, sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise, and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for robust brain anatomy detection.

<title>How Do Images Align and Complement LiDAR? Towards a Harmonized Multi-modal 3D Panoptic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D panoptic segmentation often struggles with the inherent sparsity of data from LiDAR sensors, which makes it challenging to accurately recognize distant or small objects. Recently, a few studies have sought to overcome this challenge by integrating LiDAR inputs with camera images, leveraging the rich and dense texture information provided by the latter. While these approaches have shown promising results, they still face challenges, such as misalignment during data augmentation and the reliance on post-processing steps. To address these issues, we propose Image-Assists-LiDAR (IAL), a novel multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation framework. In IAL, we first introduce a modality-synchronized data augmentation strategy, PieAug, to ensure alignment between LiDAR and image inputs from the start. Next, we adopt a transformer decoder to directly predict panoptic segmentation results. To effectively fuse LiDAR and image features into tokens for the decoder, we design a Geometric-guided Token Fusion (GTF) module. Additionally, we leverage the complementary strengths of each modality as priors for query initialization through a Prior-based Query Generation (PQG) module, enhancing the decoder's ability to generate accurate instance masks. Our IAL framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous multi-modal 3D panoptic segmentation methods on two widely used benchmarks. Code and models are publicly available at .

Abstract: Neural retrieval methods using transformer-based pre-trained language models have advanced multilingual and cross-lingual retrieval. However, their effectiveness for low-resource, morphologically rich languages such as Amharic remains underexplored due to data scarcity and suboptimal tokenization. We address this gap by introducing Amharic-specific dense retrieval models based on pre-trained Amharic BERT and RoBERTa backbones. Our proposed RoBERTa-Base-Amharic-Embed model (110M parameters) achieves a 17.6% relative improvement in MRR@10 and a 9.86% gain in Recall@10 over the strongest multilingual baseline, Arctic Embed 2.0 (568M parameters). More compact variants, such as RoBERTa-Medium-Amharic-Embed (42M), remain competitive while being over 13x smaller. Additionally, we train a ColBERT-based late interaction retrieval model that achieves the highest MRR@10 score (0.843) among all evaluated models. We benchmark our proposed models against both sparse and dense retrieval baselines to systematically assess retrieval effectiveness in Amharic. Our analysis highlights key challenges in low-resource settings and underscores the importance of language-specific adaptation. To foster future research in low-resource IR, we publicly release our dataset, codebase, and trained models at https://github.com/kidist-amde/amharic-ir-benchmarks.

Abstract: Flexible tool selection reflects a complex cognitive ability that distinguishes humans from other species, yet computational models that capture this ability remain underdeveloped. We developed a framework using low-dimensional attribute representations to bridge visual tool perception and linguistic task understanding. We constructed a comprehensive dataset (ToolNet) containing 115 common tools labeled with 13 carefully designed attributes spanning physical, functional, and psychological properties, paired with natural language scenarios describing tool usage. Visual encoders (ResNet or ViT) extract attributes from tool images while fine-tuned language models (GPT-2, LLaMA, DeepSeek) derive required attributes from task descriptions. Our approach achieves 74% accuracy in tool selection tasks-significantly outperforming direct tool matching (20%) and smaller multimodal models (21%-58%), while approaching performance of much larger models like GPT-4o (73%) with substantially fewer parameters. Ablation studies revealed that manipulation-related attributes (graspability, hand-relatedness, elongation) consistently prove most critical across modalities. This work provides a parameter-efficient, interpretable solution that mimics human-like tool cognition, advancing both cognitive science understanding and practical applications in tool selection tasks.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

<title>Can Slow-thinking LLMs Reason Over Time? Empirical Studies in Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) is a fundamental and widely studied task, spanning methods from classical statistical approaches to modern deep learning and multimodal language modeling. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often follow a fast thinking paradigm emphasizing pattern extraction and direct value mapping, while overlooking explicit reasoning over temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies. Meanwhile, emerging slow-thinking LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT-o1, DeepSeek-R1) have demonstrated impressive multi-step reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, suggesting a new opportunity for reframing TSF as a structured reasoning task. This motivates a key question: can slow-thinking LLMs effectively reason over temporal patterns to support time series forecasting, even in zero-shot manner? To investigate this, in this paper, we propose TimeReasoner, an extensive empirical study that formulates TSF as a conditional reasoning task. We design a series of prompting strategies to elicit inference-time reasoning from pretrained slow-thinking LLMs and evaluate their performance across diverse TSF benchmarks. Our findings reveal that slow-thinking LLMs exhibit non-trivial zero-shot forecasting capabilities, especially in capturing high-level trends and contextual shifts. While preliminary, our study surfaces important insights into the reasoning behaviors of LLMs in temporal domains highlighting both their potential and limitations. We hope this work catalyzes further research into reasoning-based forecasting paradigms and paves the way toward more interpretable and generalizable TSF frameworks.

Abstract: Supervised Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents an intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, aiming to use quantum resources to support model training and inference. This paper reviews recent developments in supervised QML, focusing on methods such as variational quantum circuits, quantum neural networks, and quantum kernel methods, along with hybrid quantum-classical workflows. We examine recent experimental studies that show partial indications of quantum advantage and describe current limitations including noise, barren plateaus, scalability issues, and the lack of formal proofs of performance improvement over classical methods. The main contribution is a ten-year outlook (2025-2035) that outlines possible developments in supervised QML, including a roadmap describing conditions under which QML may be used in applied research and enterprise systems over the next decade.

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios, to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed and screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive "fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: During long-duration Large Language Model (LLM) training runs the gradient norm increases rapidly near the end of training. In this short note, we show that this increase is due to an unintended interaction between weight decay, normalization layers, and the learning rate schedule. We propose a simple correction that fixes this behavior while also resulting in lower loss values throughout training.

Abstract: We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lww007/Text-Atari-Agents.

Abstract: Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.

This paper explores a joint phase design and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) and addressed using a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. Proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ optimizes RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N handles subcarrier allocation decisions. A multi-agent strategy is introduced for more efficient subcarrier allocation.

Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.

Summary:<br /><br />This study introduces a novel attack framework called AVATAR, which leverages metaphors to induce Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate harmful content.

This approach effectively jailbreaks LLMs by either directly producing harmful responses or calibrating between benign and harmful content. Experimental results show that AVATAR successfully attacks multiple advanced LLMs with a high success rate. The risk of LLMs generating harmful content through jailbreak attacks is highlighted, emphasizing the significance of understanding and mitigating this threat. <div>

Abstract: Current studies have exposed the risk of Large Language Models (LLMs) generating harmful content by jailbreak attacks. However, they overlook that the direct generation of harmful content from scratch is more difficult than inducing LLM to calibrate benign content into harmful forms. In our study, we introduce a novel attack framework that exploits AdVersArial meTAphoR (AVATAR) to induce the LLM to calibrate malicious metaphors for jailbreaking. Specifically, to answer harmful queries, AVATAR adaptively identifies a set of benign but logically related metaphors as the initial seed. Then, driven by these metaphors, the target LLM is induced to reason and calibrate about the metaphorical content, thus jailbroken by either directly outputting harmful responses or calibrating residuals between metaphorical and professional harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that AVATAR can effectively and transferable jailbreak LLMs and achieve a state-of-the-art attack success rate across multiple advanced LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, extensive deep learning architectures and pretraining strategies have been explored to support downstream protein applications. Additionally, domain-specific models incorporating biological knowledge have been developed to enhance performance in specialized tasks. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Protap}$, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically compares backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and domain-specific models across diverse and realistic downstream protein applications. Specifically, Protap covers five applications: three general tasks and two novel specialized tasks, i.e., enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage site prediction and targeted protein degradation, which are industrially relevant yet missing from existing benchmarks. For each application, Protap compares various domain-specific models and general architectures under multiple pretraining settings. Our empirical studies imply that: (i) Though large-scale pretraining encoders achieve great results, they often underperform supervised encoders trained on small downstream training sets. (ii) Incorporating structural information during downstream fine-tuning can match or even outperform protein language models pretrained on large-scale sequence corpora. (iii) Domain-specific biological priors can enhance performance on specialized downstream tasks. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Trust-App-AI-Lab/protap.

Summary:
Multimodal foundation models have made significant advancements by leveraging large-scale unlabeled multimodal data and fine-tuning with labeled datasets and prompts. However, increasing the number of instruction-tuning tasks does not always improve performance. Task grouping based on common multimodal interactions, such as identifying shared information, modality selection, and synergistic fusion, can enhance model learning by promoting transferrable skills and reducing interference from mismatched tasks. The MINT strategy introduced in this study outperforms existing task grouping methods, striking a balance between generalization and specialization in multimodal instruction tuning. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks. These breakthroughs are largely driven by new pre-training paradigms that leverage large-scale, unlabeled multimodal data, followed by instruction fine-tuning on curated labeled datasets and high-quality prompts. While there is growing interest in scaling instruction fine-tuning to ever-larger datasets in both quantity and scale, our findings reveal that simply increasing the number of instruction-tuning tasks does not consistently yield better performance. Instead, we observe that grouping tasks by the common interactions across modalities, such as discovering redundant shared information, prioritizing modality selection with unique information, or requiring synergistic fusion to discover new information from both modalities, encourages the models to learn transferrable skills within a group while suppressing interference from mismatched tasks. To this end, we introduce MINT, a simple yet surprisingly effective task-grouping strategy based on the type of multimodal interaction. We demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms existing task grouping baselines for multimodal instruction tuning, striking an effective balance between generalization and specialization.

Summary: 
BiMa is a novel framework designed to address biases in visual-linguistic datasets in text-video retrieval systems. It generates scene elements to characterize videos by identifying relevant entities and activities, enhancing video embeddings to focus on fine-grained details. For visual debiasing, scene elements are integrated into embeddings. Textual debiasing involves disentangling text features into content and bias components to prioritize meaningful content and handle biased information separately. BiMa performs well on five major TVR benchmarks and excels in out-of-distribution retrieval tasks, demonstrating its competitive performance and bias mitigation capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

Traditional methods using registration-based interpolation struggle with large deformations, leading to misregistration and artifacts. The proposed TSSC-Net framework addresses these issues by generating intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. A diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network enhances temporal fidelity under fast motion by achieving 6x super-resolution in a single step. The introduction of a tri-directional Mamba-based module helps resolve spatial inconsistencies caused by cross-slice misalignment, improving volumetric coherence and correcting errors. Experiments on cardiac and knee joint datasets show that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI images from fast-motion data while maintaining structural fidelity and spatial consistency. <div>

Abstract: In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.

<div> Latent action space, reinforcement learning, mobile manipulators, sim-to-real, autonomous learning<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces SLAC, a method designed to enable real-world reinforcement learning for complex robotic systems like mobile manipulators by utilizing a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC focuses on promoting temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety during the pretraining phase to enhance downstream learning efficiency. By using the learned latent action space as the action interface for an off-policy RL algorithm, SLAC can autonomously learn various tasks through interactions in the real world. Compared to existing methods, SLAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on a set of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness. Noteworthy is SLAC's ability to learn contact-rich whole-body tasks in a short period of time, without the need for demonstrations or manually crafted behavior priors.

Abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

<div> scalability, offline reinforcement learning, horizon reduction, SHARSA, performance improvement

Summary:
The study explores the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms by testing their performance on challenging tasks with datasets 1000 times larger than usual. The research reveals that many existing offline RL algorithms do not scale well, primarily due to long horizons. Empirical analysis confirms that long horizons act as a barrier to scalability in offline RL. Horizon reduction techniques are shown to enhance scalability significantly. A new method called SHARSA is introduced, focusing on reducing the horizon, which leads to improved performance and scalability. SHARSA outperforms other evaluation methods, demonstrating that explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the potential for scaling up offline RL. The findings provide important insights into the challenges and solutions for achieving scalability in offline RL. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL.

Abstract: Effective financial reasoning demands not only textual understanding but also the ability to interpret complex visual data such as charts, tables, and trend graphs. This paper introduces a new benchmark designed to evaluate how well AI models - especially large language and multimodal models - reason in finance-specific contexts. Covering 3,200 expert-level question-answer pairs across 15 core financial topics, the benchmark integrates both textual and visual modalities to reflect authentic analytical challenges in finance. To address limitations in current reasoning approaches, we propose an error-aware learning framework that leverages historical model mistakes and feedback to guide inference, without requiring fine-tuning. Our experiments across state-of-the-art models show that multimodal inputs significantly enhance performance and that incorporating error feedback leads to consistent and measurable improvements. The results highlight persistent challenges in visual understanding and mathematical logic, while also demonstrating the promise of self-reflective reasoning in financial AI systems.

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for representing information about entities that do not exist or may never exist, such as those involving fictional entities, blueprints, simulations, and future scenarios. Traditional approaches that introduce "dummy instances" or rely on modal logic are criticized, and a proposal is defended in which such cases are modeled using the intersections of actual types rather than specific non existent tokens. The paper positions itself within the Basic Formal Ontology and its realist commitments, emphasizing the importance of practical, implementable solutions over purely metaphysical or philosophical proposals, arguing that existing approaches to non existent entities either overcommit to metaphysical assumptions or introduce computational inefficiencies that hinder applications. By developing a structured ontology driven approach to unreal patterns, the paper aims to provide a useful and computationally viable means of handling references to hypothetical or non existent entities.

Abstract: Evolving Fuzzy Systems (eFS) have gained significant attention due to their ability to adaptively update their structure in response to data dynamics while maintaining interpretability. However, the lack of publicly available implementations of these models limits their accessibility and widespread adoption. To address this gap, we present evolvingfuzzysystems, a Python library that provides implementations of several well-established eFS models, including ePL-KRLS-DISCO, ePL+, eMG, ePL, exTS, Simpl\_eTS, and eTS. The library facilitates model evaluation and comparison by offering built-in tools for training, visualization, and performance assessment. The models are evaluated using the fetch\_california\_housing dataset, with performance measured in terms of normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE), non-dimensional error index (NDEI), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Additionally, computational complexity is analyzed by measuring execution times and rule evolution during training and testing phases. The results highlight ePL as a simple yet efficient model that balances accuracy and computational cost, making it particularly suitable for real-world applications. By making these models publicly available, evolvingfuzzysystems aims to foster research and practical applications in adaptive and interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: Amongst the most common use cases of modern AI is LLM chat with web search enabled. However, no direct evaluations of the quality of web research agents exist that control for the continually-changing web. We introduce Deep Research Bench, consisting of 89 multi-step web research task instances of varying difficulty across 8 diverse task categories, with the answers carefully worked out by skilled humans. We provide a "RetroSearch" environment with a large frozen set of scraped web pages, and demonstrate that offline "RetroSearch" agents perform comparably to "live web" agents, enabling reliable evaluations of models over time. We provide robust agent tooling and scaffolding to benchmark major LLMs as they are released, including "thinking" models like o3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro. We include automated evaluations of the lengthy agent traces to report progress over time in hallucinations, tool use, and forgetting. Finally, we evaluate the major web research products branded as "Deep Research", "Deep Search", "Search", or "Research." Results are available on a public leaderboard at https://drb.futuresearch.ai/.

<div> Keywords: Roadway safety, mobility, Large Language Models, spatio-temporal reasoning, multimodal fusion

Summary: 
Roadway safety and mobility are critical challenges in transportation, requiring innovative analytical frameworks to address complex environments. This paper reviews the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance roadway safety and mobility by adapting them through various strategies to bridge the modality gap in transportation data. The review covers applications in traffic flow prediction, signal control, crash analysis, and driver behavior assessment. The paper also examines enabling technologies such as V2X integration and explainability frameworks. Despite the potential of LLMs, challenges remain around their limitations, data governance, deployment complexities, and safety assurance. Promising future research directions include advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI collaboration, continuous learning, and developing efficient systems. Responsible innovation is emphasized to achieve safer and more intelligent transportation systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Roadway safety and mobility remain critical challenges for modern transportation systems, demanding innovative analytical frameworks capable of addressing complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous environments. While traditional engineering methods have made progress, the complexity and dynamism of real-world traffic necessitate more advanced analytical frameworks. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding, knowledge integration, and reasoning, represent a promising paradigm shift. This paper comprehensively reviews the application and customization of LLMs for enhancing roadway safety and mobility. A key focus is how LLMs are adapted -- via architectural, training, prompting, and multimodal strategies -- to bridge the "modality gap" with transportation's unique spatio-temporal and physical data. The review systematically analyzes diverse LLM applications in mobility (e.g., traffic flow prediction, signal control) and safety (e.g., crash analysis, driver behavior assessment,). Enabling technologies such as V2X integration, domain-specific foundation models, explainability frameworks, and edge computing are also examined. Despite significant potential, challenges persist regarding inherent LLM limitations (hallucinations, reasoning deficits), data governance (privacy, bias), deployment complexities (sim-to-real, latency), and rigorous safety assurance. Promising future research directions are highlighted, including advanced multimodal fusion, enhanced spatio-temporal reasoning, human-AI collaboration, continuous learning, and the development of efficient, verifiable systems. This review provides a structured roadmap of current capabilities, limitations, and opportunities, underscoring LLMs' transformative potential while emphasizing the need for responsible innovation to realize safer, more intelligent transportation systems.

The paper addresses the need for consistent terminology in studies discussing human-AI-robot co-learning and co-adaptation. It highlights the interchangeability of terms like "co-learning" and "co-adaptation" and aims to gather existing research papers to examine the terms used to describe this collaborative relationship. The study also seeks to explore the types of intelligent agents and task domains considered in research, emphasizing the diversity of human-agent interactions. Furthermore, the paper investigates the cognitive theories and frameworks utilized in existing studies to measure human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This exploration is essential for understanding the theoretical foundations of human-agent collaboration and adaptation, as well as identifying any new frameworks proposed for this specific relationship.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Several papers have delved into the challenges of human-AI-robot co-learning and co-adaptation. It has been noted that the terminology used to describe this collaborative relationship in existing studies needs to be more consistent. For example, the prefix "co" is used interchangeably to represent both "collaborative" and "mutual," and the terms "co-learning" and "co-adaptation" are sometimes used interchangeably. However, they can reflect subtle differences in the focus of the studies. The current scoping review's primary research question (RQ1) aims to gather existing papers discussing this collaboration pattern and examine the terms researchers use to describe this human-agent relationship. Given the relative newness of this area of study, we are also keen on exploring the specific types of intelligent agents and task domains that have been considered in existing research (RQ2). This exploration is significant as it can shed light on the diversity of human-agent interactions, from one-time to continuous learning/adaptation scenarios. It can also help us understand the dynamics of human-agent interactions in different task domains, guiding our expectations towards research situated in dynamic, complex domains. Our third objective (RQ3) is to investigate the cognitive theories and frameworks that have been utilized in existing studies to measure human-agent co-learning and co-adaptation. This investigation is crucial as it can help us understand the theoretical underpinnings of human-agent collaboration and adaptation, and it can also guide us in identifying any new frameworks proposed specifically for this type of relationship.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face a crucial challenge from fixed context windows and inadequate memory management, leading to a severe shortage of long-term memory capabilities and limited personalization in the interactive experience with AI agents. To overcome this challenge, we innovatively propose a Memory Operating System, i.e., MemoryOS, to achieve comprehensive and efficient memory management for AI agents. Inspired by the memory management principles in operating systems, MemoryOS designs a hierarchical storage architecture and consists of four key modules: Memory Storage, Updating, Retrieval, and Generation. Specifically, the architecture comprises three levels of storage units: short-term memory, mid-term memory, and long-term personal memory. Key operations within MemoryOS include dynamic updates between storage units: short-term to mid-term updates follow a dialogue-chain-based FIFO principle, while mid-term to long-term updates use a segmented page organization strategy. Our pioneering MemoryOS enables hierarchical memory integration and dynamic updating. Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo benchmark show an average improvement of 49.11% on F1 and 46.18% on BLEU-1 over the baselines on GPT-4o-mini, showing contextual coherence and personalized memory retention in long conversations. The implementation code is open-sourced at https://github.com/BAI-LAB/MemoryOS.

<br />
<br />
Summary: The paper examines the concept of instrumental convergence and power-seeking in a formal decision-theoretic framework concerning advanced AI risks. It evaluates the claim that power is a convergent instrumental goal for AI agents, finding some truth but limited predictive value due to the uncertainty of an agent's final goals. However, instrumental convergence is more predictive for agents striving for absolute or near-absolute power. The analysis suggests that while power may be a common goal, ranking options solely based on power is insufficient without knowledge of an agent's objectives. The discussion highlights the complexity of predicting AI behavior based on convergent instrumental goals and the significance of understanding an agent's ultimate intentions for accurate forecasting of their actions. <div>
arXiv:2506.06352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers worried about catastrophic risks from advanced AI have argued that we should expect sufficiently capable AI agents to pursue power over humanity because power is a convergent instrumental goal, something that is useful for a wide range of final goals. Others have recently expressed skepticism of these claims. This paper aims to formalize the concepts of instrumental convergence and power-seeking in an abstract, decision-theoretic framework, and to assess the claim that power is a convergent instrumental goal. I conclude that this claim contains at least an element of truth, but might turn out to have limited predictive utility, since an agent's options cannot always be ranked in terms of power in the absence of substantive information about the agent's final goals. However, the fact of instrumental convergence is more predictive for agents who have a good shot at attaining absolute or near-absolute power.

<div> Keywords: Temporal Knowledge Graphs, Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding, Inductive Approach, Sinusoidal Positional Encodings, Zero-shot Performance

Summary: 
Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store facts in quadruple format (s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding models are limited in transferring to new domains due to reliance on seen elements during inference. To address this, an inductive approach for temporal knowledge graph link prediction is introduced. The model uses sinusoidal positional encodings for capturing temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation representations through message passing. Agnostic to temporal granularity, the model can handle temporal discrepancies and facilitate information transfer across TKGs. The pretrained model, POSTRA, demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs by generalizing to novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Through theoretical analysis and empirical results, it is shown that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot performance across different inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, indicating a significant advancement for temporal KGs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) store temporal facts with quadruple formats (s, p, o, t). Existing Temporal Knowledge Graph Embedding (TKGE) models perform link prediction tasks in transductive or semi-inductive settings, which means the entities, relations, and temporal information in the test graph are fully or partially observed during training. Such reliance on seen elements during inference limits the models' ability to transfer to new domains and generalize to real-world scenarios. A central limitation is the difficulty in learning representations for entities, relations, and timestamps that are transferable and not tied to dataset-specific vocabularies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the first fully-inductive approach to temporal knowledge graph link prediction. Our model employs sinusoidal positional encodings to capture fine-grained temporal patterns and generates adaptive entity and relation representations using message passing conditioned on both local and global temporal contexts. Our model design is agnostic to temporal granularity and time span, effectively addressing temporal discrepancies across TKGs and facilitating time-aware structural information transfer. As a pretrained, scalable, and transferable model, POSTRA demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on unseen temporal knowledge graphs, effectively generalizing to novel entities, relations, and timestamps. Extensive theoretical analysis and empirical results show that a single pretrained model can improve zero-shot performance on various inductive temporal reasoning scenarios, marking a significant step toward a foundation model for temporal KGs.

Summary: <br />
Enhancing large language models by scaling datasets has limited returns, leading to a focus on data quality. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is used to generate high-quality chain-of-thought data. However, conventional approaches discard valuable insights and reasoning strategies from sibling nodes in the search tree. SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo Augmentation) reintegrates these discarded sibling nodes to improve LLM reasoning by forging semantic links and refining trajectories. By recovering signals from non-optimal branches, SIGMA significantly improves reasoning trajectories. On the MATH benchmark, SIGMA-tuned 7B model outperforms state-of-the-art models using fewer samples. This shows how sibling-guided optimization not only reduces data usage but also enhances LLM reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2506.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing large language models by simply scaling up datasets has begun to yield diminishing returns, shifting the spotlight to data quality. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has emerged as a powerful technique for generating high-quality chain-of-thought data, yet conventional approaches typically retain only the top-scoring trajectory from the search tree, discarding sibling nodes that often contain valuable partial insights, recurrent error patterns, and alternative reasoning strategies. This unconditional rejection of non-optimal reasoning branches may waste vast amounts of informative data in the whole search tree. We propose SIGMA (Sibling Guided Monte Carlo Augmentation), a novel framework that reintegrates these discarded sibling nodes to refine LLM reasoning. SIGMA forges semantic links among sibling nodes along each search path and applies a two-stage refinement: a critique model identifies overlooked strengths and weaknesses across the sibling set, and a revision model conducts text-based backpropagation to refine the top-scoring trajectory in light of this comparative feedback. By recovering and amplifying the underutilized but valuable signals from non-optimal reasoning branches, SIGMA substantially improves reasoning trajectories. On the challenging MATH benchmark, our SIGMA-tuned 7B model achieves 54.92% accuracy using only 30K samples, outperforming state-of-the-art models trained on 590K samples. This result highlights that our sibling-guided optimization not only significantly reduces data usage but also significantly boosts LLM reasoning.

<div> Keywords: Automatic Game Design, Large Language Model, PuzzleScript, Game generation, Play-testing

Summary:
ScriptDoctor is a system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate and test games in the PuzzleScript language, a constrained language for puzzle games on 2D gridworlds. The system follows an iterative loop process, using human-authored examples to guide the generation process, handling compilation errors to refine code functionality, and employing search-based agents for play-testing. This approach demonstrates the potential of integrating LLM-based workflows into game design pipelines for generating novel game content autonomously. By utilizing LLMs in the context of game generation, ScriptDoctor showcases how advanced generative models can be applied to create diverse and engaging game experiences without the need for constant human oversight. <div>
arXiv:2506.06524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is much interest in using large pre-trained models in Automatic Game Design (AGD), whether via the generation of code, assets, or more abstract conceptualization of design ideas. But so far this interest largely stems from the ad hoc use of such generative models under persistent human supervision. Much work remains to show how these tools can be integrated into longer-time-horizon AGD pipelines, in which systems interface with game engines to test generated content autonomously. To this end, we introduce ScriptDoctor, a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven system for automatically generating and testing games in PuzzleScript, an expressive but highly constrained description language for turn-based puzzle games over 2D gridworlds. ScriptDoctor generates and tests game design ideas in an iterative loop, where human-authored examples are used to ground the system's output, compilation errors from the PuzzleScript engine are used to elicit functional code, and search-based agents play-test generated games. ScriptDoctor serves as a concrete example of the potential of automated, open-ended LLM-based workflows in generating novel game content.

Summary:<br />
The study evaluated the relationship between component-level optimization and system-wide performance in multi-agent artificial intelligence systems in clinical settings using real patient cases. They focused on four abdominal pathologies and decomposed clinical diagnosis into various tasks. The findings showed that while multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, a component-optimized system with superior components performed significantly lower in diagnostic accuracy. This highlights the importance of information flow and compatibility between agents in successful AI integration in healthcare. The study emphasizes the need for end-to-end system validation rather than relying solely on component metrics for evaluation. <div>

Abstract: Multi-agent artificial intelligence systems are increasingly deployed in clinical settings, yet the relationship between component-level optimization and system-wide performance remains poorly understood. We evaluated this relationship using 2,400 real patient cases from the MIMIC-CDM dataset across four abdominal pathologies (appendicitis, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis), decomposing clinical diagnosis into information gathering, interpretation, and differential diagnosis. We evaluated single agent systems (one model performing all tasks) against multi-agent systems (specialized models for each task) using comprehensive metrics spanning diagnostic outcomes, process adherence, and cost efficiency. Our results reveal a paradox: while multi-agent systems generally outperformed single agents, the component-optimized or Best of Breed system with superior components and excellent process metrics (85.5% information accuracy) significantly underperformed in diagnostic accuracy (67.7% vs. 77.4% for a top multi-agent system). This finding underscores that successful integration of AI in healthcare requires not just component level optimization but also attention to information flow and compatibility between agents. Our findings highlight the need for end to end system validation rather than relying on component metrics alone.

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with broad real-world applications. Recent advancements in neural network-based TSP solvers have shown promising results. Nonetheless, these models often struggle to efficiently solve both small- and large-scale TSPs using the same set of pre-trained model parameters, limiting their practical utility. To address this issue, we introduce a novel neural TSP solver named GELD, built upon our proposed broad global assessment and refined local selection framework. Specifically, GELD integrates a lightweight Global-view Encoder (GE) with a heavyweight Local-view Decoder (LD) to enrich embedding representation while accelerating the decision-making process. Moreover, GE incorporates a novel low-complexity attention mechanism, allowing GELD to achieve low inference latency and scalability to larger-scale TSPs. Additionally, we propose a two-stage training strategy that utilizes training instances of different sizes to bolster GELD's generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that GELD outperforms seven state-of-the-art models considering both solution quality and inference speed. Furthermore, GELD can be employed as a post-processing method to significantly elevate the quality of the solutions derived by existing neural TSP solvers via spending affordable additional computing time. Notably, GELD is shown as capable of solving TSPs with up to 744,710 nodes, first-of-its-kind to solve this large size TSP without relying on divide-and-conquer strategies to the best of our knowledge.

Summary: Large language model (LLM) agents have been utilized for sequential decision-making tasks like web navigation but often struggle without specific experiences. This study introduces Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a framework that enables language agents to continually learn from past experiences during inference time. CER synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer, allowing agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge for new tasks. The framework was evaluated on WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks, achieving competitive performance on both. On VisualWebArena, CER reached a success rate of 31.9%, while on WebArena, it improved the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%, achieving an average success rate of 36.7%. Through comprehensive analysis, CER's efficiency, validity, and effectiveness in enhancing adaptability in complex environments were demonstrated.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have been applied to sequential decision-making tasks such as web navigation, but without any environment-specific experiences, they often fail in these complex tasks. Moreover, current LLM agents are not designed to continually learn from past experiences during inference time, which could be crucial for them to gain these environment-specific experiences. To address this, we propose Contextual Experience Replay (CER), a training-free framework to enable efficient self-improvement for language agents in their context window. Specifically, CER accumulates and synthesizes past experiences into a dynamic memory buffer. These experiences encompass environment dynamics and common decision-making patterns, allowing the agents to retrieve and augment themselves with relevant knowledge in new tasks, enhancing their adaptability in complex environments. We evaluate CER on the challenging WebArena and VisualWebArena benchmarks. On VisualWebArena, CER achieves a competitive performance of 31.9%. On WebArena, CER also gets a competitive average success rate of 36.7%, relatively improving the success rate of the GPT-4o agent baseline by 51.0%. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis on it to prove its efficiency, validity and understand it better.

<div> Keywords: SysML, PDDL, planning semantics, system models, automated generation<br />
Summary:  
The paper introduces a SysML profile that facilitates the incorporation of planning semantics based on PDDL into system models. It defines reusable stereotypes for essential PDDL concepts and ensures syntactic consistency through formal OCL constraints. Derived from the BNF definition of PDDL 3.1, the profile aligns with SysML modeling conventions. An aircraft manufacturing case study demonstrates the profile's application in modeling a robotic system with interchangeable end effectors to generate domain and problem descriptions in PDDL. These descriptions feed into a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution plans. The approach streamlines the creation of planning descriptions and establishes a reusable connection between system modeling and AI planning in engineering design. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a SysML profile that enables the direct integration of planning semantics based on the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) into system models. Reusable stereotypes are defined for key PDDL concepts such as types, predicates, functions and actions, while formal OCL constraints ensure syntactic consistency. The profile was derived from the Backus-Naur Form (BNF) definition of PDDL 3.1 to align with SysML modeling practices. A case study from aircraft manufacturing demonstrates the application of the profile: a robotic system with interchangeable end effectors is modeled and enriched to generate both domain and problem descriptions in PDDL format. These are used as input to a PDDL solver to derive optimized execution plans. The approach supports automated and model-based generation of planning descriptions and provides a reusable bridge between system modeling and AI planning in engineering design.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, world modeling, Bayesian inference, autonomous exploration, reinforcement learning

Summary:
WorldLLM is a framework designed to improve the predictive accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in structured, domain-specific contexts by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous exploration with reinforcement learning. The framework utilizes natural language hypotheses provided in the model's prompt to guide predictions and refines these hypotheses through Bayesian inference using a second LLM as a proposal distribution. Through curiosity-driven exploration, WorldLLM collects evidence to continually improve its predictions by finding transitions with low log-likelihood under the predictive model. Experiments conducted in a textual game environment show that WorldLLM not only enhances predictive accuracy but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics. This innovative approach addresses the limitations LLMs face in grounding their broad understanding in specific environments, making them more effective in generating precise predictions. 

<br /><br />Summary: WorldLLM combines Bayesian inference and autonomous exploration with reinforcement learning to enhance the predictive accuracy of Large Language Models in structured, domain-specific contexts. By guiding predictions using natural language hypotheses, refining them through Bayesian inference, and exploring the environment for evidence, WorldLLM continuously improves its predictions and generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics. <div>
arXiv:2506.06725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess general world knowledge but often struggle to generate precise predictions in structured, domain-specific contexts such as simulations. These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving capabilities across various domains. However, their ability to perform mathematical reasoning when answer options are represented as images--an essential aspect of multi-image comprehension--remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisioMath, a benchmark designed to evaluate mathematical reasoning in multimodal contexts involving image-based answer choices. VisioMath comprises 8,070 images and 1,800 multiple-choice questions, where each answer option is an image, presenting unique challenges to existing LMMs. To the best of our knowledge, VisioMath is the first dataset specifically tailored for mathematical reasoning in image-based-option scenarios, where fine-grained distinctions between answer choices are critical for accurate problem-solving. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art LMMs on VisioMath and find that even the most advanced models struggle with this task. Notably, GPT-4o achieves only 45.9% accuracy, underscoring the limitations of current models in reasoning over visually similar answer choices. By addressing a crucial gap in existing benchmarks, VisioMath establishes a rigorous testbed for future research, driving advancements in multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. The goal is to search a hypothesis space for a hypothesis that generalises training examples and background knowledge. We introduce an approach that 'shrinks' the hypothesis space before an ILP system searches it. Our approach uses background knowledge to find rules that cannot be in an optimal hypothesis regardless of the training examples. For instance, our approach discovers relationships such as "even numbers cannot be odd" and "prime numbers greater than 2 are odd". It then removes violating rules from the hypothesis space. We implement our approach using answer set programming and use it to shrink the hypothesis space of a constraint-based ILP system. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can substantially reduce learning times whilst maintaining predictive accuracies. For instance, given just 10 seconds of preprocessing time, our approach can reduce learning times from over 10 hours to only 2 seconds.

Abstract: Psychological counseling faces huge challenges due to the growing demand for mental health services and the shortage of trained professionals. Large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to assist psychological counseling, especially in empathy and emotional support. However, existing models lack a deep understanding of emotions and are unable to generate personalized treatment plans based on fine-grained emotions. To address these shortcomings, we present AI PsyRoom, a multi-agent simulation framework designed to enhance psychological counseling by generating empathetic and emotionally nuanced conversations. By leveraging fine-grained emotion classification and a multi-agent framework, we construct a multi-agent PsyRoom A for dialogue reconstruction, generating a high-quality dialogue dataset EmoPsy, which contains 35 sub-emotions, 423 specific emotion scenarios, and 12,350 dialogues. We also propose PsyRoom B for generating personalized treatment plans. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that AI PsyRoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 18% improvement in problem orientation, 23% in expression, 24% in Empathy, and 16% in interactive communication quality. The datasets and models are publicly available, providing a foundation for advancing AI-assisted psychological counseling research.

Summary: 
The paper explores the challenges of training Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), considering the influence of different learning algorithms on classification accuracy. A bioinspired classifier combining SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) is proposed for efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. The study finds that while the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves high accuracy, it is computationally expensive for real-time applications. Biologically inspired algorithms like tempotron and Spikprop offer a balance between computational efficiency and competitive classification performance, making them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results emphasize the importance of selecting the appropriate learning algorithm based on the trade-off between accuracy, computational cost, and application constraints. <div>

Abstract: Training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) is challenging due to their unique properties, including temporal dynamics, non-differentiability of spike events, and sparse event-driven activations. In this paper, we widely consider the influence of the type of chosen learning algorithm, including bioinspired learning rules on the accuracy of classification. We proposed a bioinspired classifier based on the combination of SNN and Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). This approach synergizes the strengths of SNNs in temporal precision and biological realism with LZC's structural complexity analysis, facilitating efficient and interpretable classification of spatiotemporal neural data. It turned out that the classic backpropagation algorithm achieves excellent classification accuracy, but at extremely high computational cost, which makes it impractical for real-time applications. Biologically inspired learning algorithms such as tempotron and Spikprop provide increased computational efficiency while maintaining competitive classification performance, making them suitable for time-sensitive tasks. The results obtained indicate that the selection of the most appropriate learning algorithm depends on the trade-off between classification accuracy and computational cost as well as application constraints.

<br />Summary:
Autonomous systems involved in high-stakes search-and-rescue missions need to efficiently gather crucial information and adapt to changing priorities. The proposed CA-MIQ framework combines standard task-reward evaluation with intrinsic state-novelty and priority alignment criteria for improved decision-making. A shift detector triggers exploration enhancements and critic resets to help the agent refocus after priority changes. In simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, CA-MIQ outperforms baseline methods by achieving higher success rates after priority adjustments. It demonstrates significant adaptability to changes in information importance, ensuring successful mission execution in environments with varying information-value distributions. <div>
arXiv:2506.06786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems operating in high-stakes search-and-rescue (SAR) missions must continuously gather mission-critical information while flexibly adapting to shifting operational priorities. We propose CA-MIQ (Context-Aware Max-Information Q-learning), a lightweight dual-critic reinforcement learning (RL) framework that dynamically adjusts its exploration strategy whenever mission priorities change. CA-MIQ pairs a standard extrinsic critic for task reward with an intrinsic critic that fuses state-novelty, information-location awareness, and real-time priority alignment. A built-in shift detector triggers transient exploration boosts and selective critic resets, allowing the agent to re-focus after a priority revision. In a simulated SAR grid-world, where experiments specifically test adaptation to changes in the priority order of information types the agent is expected to focus on, CA-MIQ achieves nearly four times higher mission-success rates than baselines after a single priority shift and more than three times better performance in multiple-shift scenarios, achieving 100% recovery while baseline methods fail to adapt. These results highlight CA-MIQ's effectiveness in any discrete environment with piecewise-stationary information-value distributions.

Summary: Large Language Models can go beyond generative sampling by engaging in tasks such as summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, and more through Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games. These games involve cross-entropy scores and constraints, and can be expressed as computational graphs. The Xent Game space is rich and can measure the abilities of LLMs. Xent Game measures are constructed as capability benchmarks from a given scope. To address the challenge of measuring general abilities, exploring the space of Xent Games in a structured manner is proposed, drawing inspiration from evolutionary dynamics. <div>
arXiv:2506.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) define probability measures on text. By considering the implicit knowledge question of what it means for an LLM to know such a measure and what it entails algorithmically, we are naturally led to formulate a series of tasks that go beyond generative sampling, involving forms of summarization, counterfactual thinking, anomaly detection, originality search, reverse prompting, debating, creative solving, etc. These tasks can be formulated as games based on LLM measures, which we call Cross-Entropy (Xent) Games. Xent Games can be single-player or multi-player. They involve cross-entropy scores and cross-entropy constraints, and can be expressed as simple computational graphs and programs. We show the Xent Game space is large enough to contain a wealth of interesting examples, while being constructible from basic game-theoretic consistency axioms. We then discuss how the Xent Game space can be used to measure the abilities of LLMs. This leads to the construction of Xent Game measures: finite families of Xent Games that can be used as capability benchmarks, built from a given scope, by extracting a covering measure. To address the unbounded scope problem associated with the challenge of measuring general abilities, we propose to explore the space of Xent Games in a coherent fashion, using ideas inspired by evolutionary dynamics.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Cognitive Load Theory, CoThinker, Multi-agent framework, Problem-solving tasks

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with complex tasks due to cognitive overload, similar to human cognitive limitations explained by Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). CoThinker is introduced as a multi-agent framework that leverages CLT principles to improve collaborative problem-solving by distributing cognitive load among agents and managing communication effectively. Empirical validation of CoThinker demonstrates enhanced solution quality and efficiency on complex tasks compared to existing baselines. Analysis of interaction patterns highlights the emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, offering a systematic approach to overcoming performance limitations in LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2506.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a notable performance ceiling on complex, multi-faceted tasks, as they often fail to integrate diverse information or adhere to multiple constraints. We posit that such limitation arises when the demands of a task exceed the LLM's effective cognitive load capacity. This interpretation draws a strong analogy to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) in cognitive science, which explains similar performance boundaries in the human mind, and is further supported by emerging evidence that reveals LLMs have bounded working memory characteristics. Building upon this CLT-grounded understanding, we introduce CoThinker, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework designed to mitigate cognitive overload and enhance collaborative problem-solving abilities. CoThinker operationalizes CLT principles by distributing intrinsic cognitive load through agent specialization and managing transactional load via structured communication and a collective working memory. We empirically validate CoThinker on complex problem-solving tasks and fabricated high cognitive load scenarios, demonstrating improvements over existing multi-agent baselines in solution quality and efficiency. Our analysis reveals characteristic interaction patterns, providing insights into the emergence of collective cognition and effective load management, thus offering a principled approach to overcoming LLM performance ceilings.

<div> Keywords: Machine Learning, Safety assessment, Probabilistic safety assurance, Bayesian Networks, Automotive platooning 

Summary: 
Machine Learning models are being increasingly used in safety-critical systems like autonomous vehicle platooning, but their imperfections can lead to reasoning failures due to shifts in data distribution. Traditional safety assessment methods are not suitable for ML components, which learn behavior from data. SafeML and Bayesian Networks are combined in a probabilistic safety assurance framework to dynamically detect shifts and assign confidence levels to ML-based components' reasoning. This approach allows for dynamic safety evaluation and system adaptation under uncertainty. A simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition is used to demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, showing the potential benefits of explicitly modelling ML failures in safety assessment. <div>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicle platooning, to enable real-time decision-making. However, their inherent imperfection introduces a new class of failure: reasoning failures often triggered by distributional shifts between operational and training data. Traditional safety assessment methods, which rely on design artefacts or code, are ill-suited for ML components that learn behaviour from data. SafeML was recently proposed to dynamically detect such shifts and assign confidence levels to the reasoning of ML-based components. Building on this, we introduce a probabilistic safety assurance framework that integrates SafeML with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to model ML failures as part of a broader causal safety analysis. This allows for dynamic safety evaluation and system adaptation under uncertainty. We demonstrate the approach on an simulated automotive platooning system with traffic sign recognition. The findings highlight the potential broader benefits of explicitly modelling ML failures in safety assessment.

<div> Keywords: Deep knowledge analysis, Knowledge organization, Reasoning, LLM, KDR framework

Summary:
The paper introduces the Knowledgeable Deep Research (KDR) framework to enhance deep research with deep knowledge analysis capabilities. It addresses challenges such as the lack of knowledge organization, online operation inefficiencies, and limited knowledge computation abilities in existing frameworks. The KDR framework includes an independent knowledge organization phase for preprocessing domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline. It extends deep research with additional reasoning steps for complex knowledge computation online. The paper also introduces \KCII, an LLM that bridges knowledge organization and reasoning through unified code generation. \KCII generates instantiation code for data transformation into knowledge objects and analysis code for deep analysis results. Experimental results on multiple datasets across various knowledge analysis tasks show the effectiveness of \KCII. Integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII produces high-quality reports with insightful analytical results, outperforming mainstream deep research frameworks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep knowledge analysis tasks always involve the systematic extraction and association of knowledge from large volumes of data, followed by logical reasoning to discover insights. However, to solve such complex tasks, existing deep research frameworks face three major challenges: 1) They lack systematic organization and management of knowledge; 2) They operate purely online, making it inefficient for tasks that rely on shared and large-scale knowledge; 3) They cannot perform complex knowledge computation, limiting their abilities to produce insightful analytical results. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a \textbf{K}nowledgeable \textbf{D}eep \textbf{R}esearch (\textbf{KDR}) framework that empowers deep research with deep knowledge analysis capability. Specifically, it introduces an independent knowledge organization phase to preprocess large-scale, domain-relevant data into systematic knowledge offline. Based on this knowledge, it extends deep research with an additional kind of reasoning steps that perform complex knowledge computation in an online manner. To enhance the abilities of LLMs to solve knowledge analysis tasks in the above framework, we further introduce \textbf{\KCII}, an LLM that bridges knowledge organization and reasoning via unified code generation. For knowledge organization, it generates instantiation code for predefined classes, transforming data into knowledge objects. For knowledge computation, it generates analysis code and executes on the above knowledge objects to obtain deep analysis results. Experimental results on more than thirty datasets across six knowledge analysis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of \KCII. Moreover, when integrated into the KDR framework, \KCII can generate high-quality reports with insightful analytical results compared to the mainstream deep research framework.

<div> distillation, few-shot capabilities, meta-learning, attention-mapper module, VL-ICL Bench

Summary:
The paper introduces a meta-learning approach to enhance the few-shot capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) by using a fixed set of soft prompts distilled from task-relevant image features. An attention-mapper module is proposed to facilitate the distillation process, which can be integrated with the LLaVA v1.5 architecture. This approach enables task adaptation in LMMs with minimal data, requiring just a few gradient steps. Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench demonstrates that the method consistently outperforms in-context learning (ICL) and related prompt-tuning approaches, even in the presence of image perturbations. Results show improved task induction and reasoning abilities across visual question answering tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) often rely on in-context learning (ICL) to perform new tasks with minimal supervision. However, ICL performance, especially in smaller LMMs, is inconsistent and does not always improve monotonically with increasing examples. We hypothesize that this occurs due to the LMM being overwhelmed by additional information present in the image embeddings, which is not required for the downstream task. To address this, we propose a meta-learning approach that provides an alternative for inducing few-shot capabilities in LMMs, using a fixed set of soft prompts that are distilled from task-relevant image features and can be adapted at test time using a few examples. To facilitate this distillation, we introduce an attention-mapper module that can be easily integrated with the popular LLaVA v1.5 architecture and is jointly learned with soft prompts, enabling task adaptation in LMMs under low-data regimes with just a few gradient steps. Evaluation on the VL-ICL Bench shows that our method consistently outperforms ICL and related prompt-tuning approaches, even under image perturbations, improving task induction and reasoning across visual question answering tasks.

<div> Keywords: causality, event reasoning, Large Language Models, causal event graphs, downstream applications

Summary: 
This paper addresses the challenge of accurately identifying causal connections between events using Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors propose generating causal event graphs as a parallel mechanism to explicitly represent causality during inference. They introduce a collaborative approach to generating these graphs, involving multiple rounds of discussions among simulated experts focusing on specific semantic relations. The consolidated discussions by a final expert lead to accurate graph generation. The utility of causal graphs is demonstrated in various downstream applications, including a new explainable event prediction task that requires a causal chain of events in the explanation. The explanations generated using causal graphs are more informative and coherent than baseline generations. The approach achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art models on forecasting and next event prediction tasks without being fine-tuned on any specific task. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Understanding how events in a scenario causally connect with each other is important for effectively modeling and reasoning about events. But event reasoning remains a difficult challenge, and despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle to accurately identify causal connections between events. This struggle leads to poor performance on deeper reasoning tasks like event forecasting and timeline understanding. To address this challenge, we investigate the generation of causal event graphs (e.g., A enables B) as a parallel mechanism to help LLMs explicitly represent causality during inference. This paper evaluates both how to generate correct graphs as well as how graphs can assist reasoning. We propose a collaborative approach to causal graph generation where we use LLMs to simulate experts that focus on specific semantic relations. The experts engage in multiple rounds of discussions which are then consolidated by a final expert. Then, to demonstrate the utility of causal graphs, we use them on multiple downstream applications, and also introduce a new explainable event prediction task that requires a causal chain of events in the explanation. These explanations are more informative and coherent than baseline generations. Finally, our overall approach not finetuned on any downstream task, achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art models on both forecasting and next event prediction tasks.

<div> approach, SPOC, self-correction, large language models, math reasoning
<br />
Summary:
The article presents SPOC, a novel approach for improving math reasoning in large language models (LLMs) through spontaneous self-correction. SPOC allows LLMs to generate solutions and verifications in a single pass, dynamically terminating generation based on verification outcomes. By assigning dual roles to the model – solution proposer and verifier – SPOC enables real-time self-corrections. The approach leverages synthetic data for fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning to enhance solution proposal and verification accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with accuracy gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23, and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24 for the Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct models, respectively. SPOC represents a promising strategy for enhancing math reasoning capabilities in LLMs, showcasing the potential for self-improving loops in complex reasoning tasks.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success on a broad range of tasks, math reasoning remains a challenging one. One of the approaches for improving math reasoning is self-correction, which designs self-improving loops to let the model correct its own mistakes. However, existing self-correction approaches treat corrections as standalone post-generation refinements, relying on extra prompt and system designs to elicit self-corrections, instead of performing real-time, spontaneous self-corrections in a single pass. To address this, we propose SPOC, a spontaneous self-correction approach that enables LLMs to generate interleaved solutions and verifications in a single inference pass, with generation dynamically terminated based on verification outcomes, thereby effectively scaling inference time compute. SPOC considers a multi-agent perspective by assigning dual roles -- solution proposer and verifier -- to the same model. We adopt a simple yet effective approach to generate synthetic data for fine-tuning, enabling the model to develop capabilities for self-verification and multi-agent collaboration. We further improve its solution proposal and verification accuracy through online reinforcement learning. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that SPOC significantly improves performance. Notably, SPOC boosts the accuracy of Llama-3.1-8B and 70B Instruct models, achieving gains of 8.8% and 11.6% on MATH500, 10.0% and 20.0% on AMC23, and 3.3% and 6.7% on AIME24, respectively.

Summary: 
In this study, the researchers investigate the capabilities and limitations of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by utilizing controllable puzzle environments. They found that LRMs exhibit an accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities and have a scaling limit where reasoning effort declines despite having remaining token budget. The study compares LRMs with standard Language Models (LLMs) and identifies three performance regimes based on complexity. LRMs demonstrate an advantage in medium-complexity tasks but face complete collapse in high-complexity tasks. The researchers also discovered limitations in LRMs' exact computation abilities, as they struggle to use explicit algorithms consistently. Additionally, an analysis of the reasoning traces reveals patterns of explored solutions and sheds light on the models' computational behavior, highlighting their strengths and limitations while also raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.

Summary:
This paper explores the problem of learning a decision policy in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that maximizes utility while adhering to constraints expressed in deontic logic. The utility function represents the agent's mission, while the deontic formula imposes ethical or social constraints on the agent's behavior. The study uses Expected Act Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic, to analyze controlled MDPs. By developing a modified policy improvement method, the paper demonstrates achieving a constrained local maximum of mission utility in a bi-level structure. The approach allows the agent to simultaneously optimize two value functions, one of which is implicit. Experimental results on sample MDPs validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.06959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are the most common model for decision making under uncertainty in the Machine Learning community. An MDP captures non-determinism, probabilistic uncertainty, and an explicit model of action. A Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent learns to act in an MDP by maximizing a utility function. This paper considers the problem of learning a decision policy that maximizes utility subject to satisfying a constraint expressed in deontic logic. In this setup, the utility captures the agent's mission - such as going quickly from A to B. The deontic formula represents (ethical, social, situational) constraints on how the agent might achieve its mission by prohibiting classes of behaviors. We use the logic of Expected Act Utilitarianism, a probabilistic stit logic that can be interpreted over controlled MDPs. We develop a variation on policy improvement, and show that it reaches a constrained local maximum of the mission utility. Given that in stit logic, an agent's duty is derived from value maximization, this can be seen as a way of acting to simultaneously maximize two value functions, one of which is implicit, in a bi-level structure. We illustrate these results with experiments on sample MDPs.

The article introduces a novel framework, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), for discovering novel classes in unlabeled samples in long-tailed distributions. The framework addresses the issue of imbalanced real-world datasets by utilizing a self-guided labeling technique to generate pseudo-labels and a representation balancing process to derive discriminative representations. The self-guided labeling technique uses a learnable distribution to reduce bias in classifiers, while the representation balancing process focuses on tail classes by mining sample neighborhoods.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) utilizes labeled samples of known classes to discover novel classes in unlabeled samples. Existing methods show effective performance on artificial datasets with balanced distributions. However, real-world datasets are always imbalanced, significantly affecting the effectiveness of these methods. To solve this problem, we propose a novel framework that performs generalized category discovery in long-tailed distributions. We first present a self-guided labeling technique that uses a learnable distribution to generate pseudo-labels, resulting in less biased classifiers. We then introduce a representation balancing process to derive discriminative representations. By mining sample neighborhoods, this process encourages the model to focus more on tail classes. We conduct experiments on public datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results show that our model exceeds previous state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
This study introduces a novel approach to analyzing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents using tools from neuroscience and ethology in a complex environment called ForageWorld. By applying joint behavioral and neural analysis, the researchers uncover detailed insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning. Contrary to common assumptions, they find that DRL agents can exhibit planning-like behavior without explicit memory modules or world models, solely through emergent dynamics. The study emphasizes the importance of bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI to understand and enhance the behavior of complex and autonomous agents. By applying neuroethology-inspired tools to analyze DRL agents like animals, the researchers reveal rich structure in learning dynamics that would otherwise go unnoticed. The results provide a general analysis framework that links behavioral and representational features to diagnostic methods, offering valuable insights for a wide range of tasks and agents. This interdisciplinary approach can lead to safer and more desirable behaviors in artificial intelligence systems.

arXiv:2506.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents -- particularly as task and agent sophistication increase -- requires more than simple comparison of reward curves, yet standard methods for behavioral analysis remain underdeveloped in DRL. We apply tools from neuroscience and ethology to study DRL agents in a novel, complex, partially observable environment, ForageWorld, designed to capture key aspects of real-world animal foraging -- including sparse, depleting resource patches, predator threats, and spatially extended arenas. We use this environment as a platform for applying joint behavioral and neural analysis to agents, revealing detailed, quantitatively grounded insights into agent strategies, memory, and planning. Contrary to common assumptions, we find that model-free RNN-based DRL agents can exhibit structured, planning-like behavior purely through emergent dynamics -- without requiring explicit memory modules or world models. Our results show that studying DRL agents like animals -- analyzing them with neuroethology-inspired tools that reveal structure in both behavior and neural dynamics -- uncovers rich structure in their learning dynamics that would otherwise remain invisible. We distill these tools into a general analysis framework linking core behavioral and representational features to diagnostic methods, which can be reused for a wide range of tasks and agents. As agents grow more complex and autonomous, bridging neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI will be essential -- not just for understanding their behavior, but for ensuring safe alignment and maximizing desirable behaviors that are hard to measure via reward. We show how this can be done by drawing on lessons from how biological intelligence is studied.

Summary:
This study explores the use of peer prediction to detect cheating in crowdsourcing tasks, particularly those involving large language models (LLMs). The researchers address the challenge of LLM-generated responses compromising datasets designed to reflect human input. By quantifying correlations between worker answers and considering LLM-generated labels, the proposed approach aims to mitigate cheating without requiring high-dimensional training data. The method is training-free and offers theoretical guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world crowdsourcing datasets. <div>
arXiv:2506.06991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent success of generative AI highlights the crucial role of high-quality human feedback in building trustworthy AI systems. However, the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) by crowdsourcing workers poses a significant challenge: datasets intended to reflect human input may be compromised by LLM-generated responses. Existing LLM detection approaches often rely on high-dimension training data such as text, making them unsuitable for annotation tasks like multiple-choice labeling. In this work, we investigate the potential of peer prediction -- a mechanism that evaluates the information within workers' responses without using ground truth -- to mitigate LLM-assisted cheating in crowdsourcing with a focus on annotation tasks. Our approach quantifies the correlations between worker answers while conditioning on (a subset of) LLM-generated labels available to the requester. Building on prior research, we propose a training-free scoring mechanism with theoretical guarantees under a crowdsourcing model that accounts for LLM collusion. We establish conditions under which our method is effective and empirically demonstrate its robustness in detecting low-effort cheating on real-world crowdsourcing datasets.

Summary:
Mathesis introduces an end-to-end theorem proving pipeline called Mathesis-Autoformalizer, which enhances the formalization ability of natural language problems through reinforcement learning. It also includes the LeanScorer framework for assessing formalization quality. The Mathesis-Prover component generates formal proofs from formalized statements. The benchmark Gaokao-Formal consists of 488 complex problems from China's college entrance exam, evaluating the real-world applicability of the system. Experimental results show Mathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming baselines by 22% on Gaokao-Formal.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models show strong promise for formal reasoning. However, most LLM-based theorem provers have long been constrained by the need for expert-written formal statements as inputs, limiting their applicability to real-world problems expressed in natural language. We tackle this gap with Mathesis, the first end-to-end theorem proving pipeline processing informal problem statements. It contributes Mathesis-Autoformalizer, the first autoformalizer using reinforcement learning to enhance the formalization ability of natural language problems, aided by our novel LeanScorer framework for nuanced formalization quality assessment. It also proposes a Mathesis-Prover, which generates formal proofs from the formalized statements. To evaluate the real-world applicability of end-to-end formal theorem proving, we introduce Gaokao-Formal, a benchmark of 488 complex problems from China's national college entrance exam. Our approach is carefully designed, with a thorough study of each component. Experiments demonstrate Mathesis's effectiveness, with the autoformalizer outperforming the best baseline by 22% in pass-rate on Gaokao-Formal. The full system surpasses other model combinations, achieving 64% accuracy on MiniF2F with pass@32 and a state-of-the-art 18% on Gaokao-Formal.

<div> Framework, Multi-hop Fact Verification, Reasoning Paths, Structured Graphs, Evidence Retrieval 

Summary: 
The article introduces a Structural Reasoning framework for Multi-hop Fact Verification to address challenges in automated fact verification systems. The framework includes two key modules: a structure-enhanced retrieval mechanism that constructs reasoning graphs to guide evidence collection, and a reasoning-path-guided verification module that incrementally builds subgraphs to represent evolving inference trajectories. Additionally, a structure-aware reasoning mechanism captures long-range dependencies across multi-hop evidence chains for more accurate verification. Experiment results on FEVER and HoVer datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of reasoning-path modeling in improving retrieval precision and verification accuracy. <div>

Abstract: The growing complexity of factual claims in real-world scenarios presents significant challenges for automated fact verification systems, particularly in accurately aggregating and reasoning over multi-hop evidence. Existing approaches often rely on static or shallow models that fail to capture the evolving structure of reasoning paths, leading to fragmented retrieval and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose a Structural Reasoning framework for Multi-hop Fact Verification that explicitly models reasoning paths as structured graphs throughout both evidence retrieval and claim verification stages. Our method comprises two key modules: a structure-enhanced retrieval mechanism that constructs reasoning graphs to guide evidence collection, and a reasoning-path-guided verification module that incrementally builds subgraphs to represent evolving inference trajectories. We further incorporate a structure-aware reasoning mechanism that captures long-range dependencies across multi-hop evidence chains, enabling more precise verification. Extensive experiments on the FEVER and HoVer datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of reasoning-path modeling in enhancing retrieval precision and verification accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, BRIGHT benchmark, multi-agent pipeline, large language models, corpus cleaning

Summary: 
The study introduces MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that utilizes large language models to enhance the quality of the BRIGHT benchmark by addressing structural noise and semantic segmentation issues. The newly created corpus, BRIGHT-Plus, preserves relevant spans and improves contextual coherence, leading to significant enhancements in retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning performance. The researchers identify specific StackExchange-derived subdomains with common web-crawled artifacts, while other domains like Coding and Theorem-based content are relatively cleaner. By releasing both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline, the study aims to support future research on robust retrieval systems with a focus on reasoning-centric approaches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems require corpora that are both structurally clean and semantically coherent. BRIGHT is a recent and influential benchmark designed to evaluate complex multi-hop retrieval across diverse, high-reasoning domains. However, its practical effectiveness is limited by common web-crawled artifacts - such as content redundancy and semantic discontinuity - that impair retrieval accuracy and downstream reasoning. Notably, we find that such issues are concentrated in seven StackExchange-derived subdomains, while other domains (e.g., Coding and Theorem-based content) remain relatively clean.
  In this study, we present MARCUS, a multi-agent pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically clean and re-chunk BRIGHT into a higher-quality corpus: BRIGHT-Plus. MARCUS applies dedicated agents for structural noise removal and semantic segmentation, preserving answer-bearing spans while improving contextual integrity. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that BRIGHT-Plus yields consistent and significant improvements in both retrieval accuracy and multi-hop reasoning across a diverse set of retrievers. We release both the BRIGHT-Plus corpus and the MARCUS pipeline to support future research on robust, reasoning-centric retrieval.

Summary: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a user-friendly framework designed for ML and AI developers, allowing easy implementation of federated learning algorithms without requiring advanced programming skills. A new translation process using ChatGPT has been introduced to automate the conversion of Python federated learning algorithms into CSP processes. ChatGPT assists in estimating the minimality of context needed for translation. The process was successfully validated through the translation and verification of both centralized and decentralized federated learning algorithms using the model checker PAT. This automated approach streamlines the translation process and ensures the safety and liveness properties of the algorithms are maintained, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of federated learning implementation. <div>

Abstract: The Python Testbed for Federated Learning Algorithms is a simple Python FL framework that is easy to use by ML&amp;AI developers who do not need to be professional programmers and is also amenable to LLMs. In the previous research, generic federated learning algorithms provided by this framework were manually translated into the CSP processes and algorithms' safety and liveness properties were automatically verified by the model checker PAT. In this paper, a simple translation process is introduced wherein the ChatGPT is used to automate the translation of the mentioned federated learning algorithms in Python into the corresponding CSP processes. Within the process, the minimality of the used context is estimated based on the feedback from ChatGPT. The proposed translation process was experimentally validated by successful translation (verified by the model checker PAT) of both generic centralized and decentralized federated learning algorithms.

<div> Keywords: multimodal large language models, hallucination, behavioral hallucination, SHE, BEACH

Summary:
This article introduces a new framework called SHE (Sequence Hallucination Eradication) to address behavioral hallucinations in multimodal large language models. These hallucinations, caused by prior-driven bias and the snowball effect, can limit the reliability and scalability of such models. SHE consists of two stages: detecting hallucinations through visual-textual alignment checks and mitigating them by projecting onto the joint embedding space. A new metric called BEACH is proposed to quantify the severity of behavioral hallucinations. Empirical results on standard benchmarks show that SHE reduces behavioral hallucinations by over 10% on the BEACH metric while maintaining descriptive accuracy. This work fills a gap in research on hallucinations in sequential images, providing a lightweight solution to improve the reliability of multimodal models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.07184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at various tasks, they still suffer from hallucinations, which limit their reliability and scalability for broader domain applications. To address this issue, recent research mainly focuses on objective hallucination. However, for sequential images, besides objective hallucination, there is also behavioral hallucination, which is less studied. This work aims to fill in the gap. We first reveal that behavioral hallucinations mainly arise from two key factors: prior-driven bias and the snowball effect. Based on these observations, we introduce SHE (Sequence Hallucination Eradication), a lightweight, two-stage framework that (1) detects hallucinations via visual-textual alignment check using our proposed adaptive temporal window and (2) mitigates them via orthogonal projection onto the joint embedding space. We also propose a new metric (BEACH) to quantify behavioral hallucination severity. Empirical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SHE reduces behavioral hallucination by over 10% on BEACH while maintaining descriptive accuracy.

Summary: 
This study explores strategies for developing a customised GPT agent to code classroom dialogue efficiently. While manual transcript coding is labor-intensive, using large language models like GPT-4 can automate this process. The study assesses how well MyGPT, a GPT-4 agent, codes classroom dialogue using a human codebook and investigates performance variations with different inputs. Through a design-based research approach, the study discovers practical strategies for configuring effective agents with limited data, enabling MyGPT to generate useful coding suggestions. Despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can be a valuable coding assistant for dialogue researchers. <div>
arXiv:2506.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates effective strategies for developing a customised GPT agent to code classroom dialogue. While classroom dialogue is widely recognised as a crucial element of education, its analysis remains challenging due to the need for a nuanced understanding of dialogic functions and the labour-intensive nature of manual transcript coding. Recent advancements in large language models offer promising avenues for automating this process. However, existing studies predominantly focus on training large-scale models or evaluating pre-trained models with fixed codebooks, which are often not applicable or replicable for dialogue researchers working with small datasets or customised coding schemes. Using GPT-4's MyGPT agent as a case, this study evaluates its baseline performance in coding classroom dialogue with a human codebook and examines how performance varies with different example inputs through a variable control method. Through a design-based research approach, it identifies a set of practical strategies, based on MyGPT's unique features, for configuring effective agents with limited data. The findings suggest that, despite some limitations, a MyGPT agent developed with these strategies can serve as a useful coding assistant by generating coding suggestions.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, generalization, task perturbation, fine-tuning, dynamic evaluation

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance on vision-language benchmarks but concerns about data contamination during training may affect true generalization. A new dynamic evaluation framework has been proposed to assess MLLM generalization by perturbing tasks instead of inputs. This approach helps determine if model performance is robust or relies on task-specific cues. The study analyzes leading image/video MLLMs on various benchmarks and showcases the impact of fine-tuning on simulated test data, indicating a trade-off between task-specific performance and overall generalization. The dynamic task perturbation method provides deeper insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from spurious leakage or overfitting. Overall, this framework offers a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities across a range of tasks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.07202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show impressive vision-language benchmark performance, yet growing concerns about data contamination (test set exposure during training) risk masking true generalization. This concern extends to reasoning MLLMs, often fine-tuned via reinforcement learning from potentially contaminated base models. We propose a novel dynamic evaluation framework to rigorously assess MLLM generalization, moving beyond static benchmarks. Instead of perturbing inputs, we perturb the task itself. Using the same visual input, models are evaluated across a family of tasks (e.g., QA, captioning, question posing, verification) to probe diverse capabilities. This task perturbation reveals whether model performance is robust or reliant on superficial task-specific cues. Our approach is analogous to loss landscape sharpness: models overfit or contaminated for a single task (sharp minima) falter under task shifts, unlike models with generalizable solutions (flatter minima). We developed an automated pipeline with a calibrated judge scoring open-ended generations (captions, questions) using paraphrase and corruption sampling. Applying this framework to leading image/video MLLMs on benchmarks including MME, RealWorldQA, and CVRR-ES, we analyze each model's cross-task "ability vector." We demonstrate that fine-tuning on simulated test data (extreme contamination) drastically sharpens task-specific performance but harms overall generalization. Our dynamic task perturbation offers deeper insights into MLLM generalization, distinguishing genuine understanding from spurious leakage or overfitting.

Abstract: Existing computer-use agents primarily focus on general-purpose desktop automation tasks, with limited exploration of their application in highly specialized domains. In particular, the 3D building modeling process in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector involves open-ended design tasks and complex interaction patterns within Building Information Modeling (BIM) authoring software, which has yet to be thoroughly addressed by current studies. In this paper, we propose BIMgent, an agentic framework powered by multimodal large language models (LLMs), designed to enable autonomous building model authoring via graphical user interface (GUI) operations. BIMgent automates the architectural building modeling process, including multimodal input for conceptual design, planning of software-specific workflows, and efficient execution of the authoring GUI actions. We evaluate BIMgent on real-world building modeling tasks, including both text-based conceptual design generation and reconstruction from existing building design. The design quality achieved by BIMgent was found to be reasonable. Its operations achieved a 32% success rate, whereas all baseline models failed to complete the tasks (0% success rate). Results demonstrate that BIMgent effectively reduces manual workload while preserving design intent, highlighting its potential for practical deployment in real-world architectural modeling scenarios.

<div> Keywords: embodied intelligence, large language models, decision-making, latency, high-risk scenarios

Summary:
In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models (LLMs) has greatly improved agent decision-making capabilities. Researchers are now focusing on agent performance in dynamic high-risk scenarios such as fire, flood, and wind situations within the HAZARD benchmark. One critical yet overlooked issue in these extreme scenarios is the delay in decision-making. To address this, a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) has been proposed to align cognitive and physical costs using an FPS-based metric. The HAZARD benchmark has been extended with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action Ratio (LAR) to create a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. The Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA) has been introduced, which combines a lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to facilitate immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in real-time. Experimental results show that RRARA significantly outperforms existing baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Abstract: In the realm of embodied intelligence, the evolution of large language models (LLMs) has markedly enhanced agent decision making. Consequently, researchers have begun exploring agent performance in dynamically changing high-risk scenarios, i.e., fire, flood, and wind scenarios in the HAZARD benchmark. Under these extreme conditions, the delay in decision making emerges as a crucial yet insufficiently studied issue. We propose a Time Conversion Mechanism (TCM) that translates inference delays in decision-making into equivalent simulation frames, thus aligning cognitive and physical costs under a single FPS-based metric. By extending HAZARD with Respond Latency (RL) and Latency-to-Action Ratio (LAR), we deliver a fully latency-aware evaluation protocol. Moreover, we present the Rapid-Reflex Async-Reflect Agent (RRARA), which couples a lightweight LLM-guided feedback module with a rule-based agent to enable immediate reactive behaviors and asynchronous reflective refinements in situ. Experiments on HAZARD show that RRARA substantially outperforms existing baselines in latency-sensitive scenarios.

Summary:  
Policy tree search algorithms utilize a policy to guide the search process, with guarantees based on policy quality. Training these policies traditionally requires complete solution trajectories, leading to high costs for hard instances and wasted search samples. This paper proposes a method for learning subgoal-based policies from search tree expansions, including unsuccessful attempts. By conditioning policies on subgoals, the approach improves sample efficiency and training in an online setting. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the policy formulation and training method in enhancing the learning process for policies and heuristic functions in policy tree search algorithms. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Policy tree search is a family of tree search algorithms that use a policy to guide the search. These algorithms provide guarantees on the number of expansions required to solve a given problem that are based on the quality of the policy. While these algorithms have shown promising results, the process in which they are trained requires complete solution trajectories to train the policy. Search trajectories are obtained during a trial-and-error search process. When the training problem instances are hard, learning can be prohibitively costly, especially when starting from a randomly initialized policy. As a result, search samples are wasted in failed attempts to solve these hard instances. This paper introduces a novel method for learning subgoal-based policies for policy tree search algorithms. The subgoals and policies conditioned on subgoals are learned from the trees that the search expands while attempting to solve problems, including the search trees of failed attempts. We empirically show that our policy formulation and training method improve the sample efficiency of learning a policy and heuristic function in this online setting.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, software vulnerabilities, reasoning data, vulnerability patterns, ReVD framework

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) have shown proficiency in coding tasks but struggle with detecting software vulnerabilities due to a lack of reasoning data and focus on semantic representations. The ReVD framework aims to overcome these limitations by synthesizing reasoning data and optimizing preferences for vulnerability detection. By creating forward and backward reasoning processes and utilizing supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, ReVD enhances its understanding of vulnerability patterns. Experiments on PrimeVul and SVEN datasets show that ReVD achieves significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing LLM-based methods. This framework sets a new state-of-the-art for software vulnerability detection, emphasizing the importance of reasoning data synthesis and preference optimization in enhancing LLM capabilities in this domain. The ReVD framework and related data can be accessed on GitHub for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.07390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate considerable proficiency in numerous coding-related tasks; however, their capabilities in detecting software vulnerabilities remain limited. This limitation primarily stems from two factors: (1) the absence of reasoning data related to vulnerabilities, which hinders the models' ability to capture underlying vulnerability patterns; and (2) their focus on learning semantic representations rather than the reason behind them, thus failing to recognize semantically similar vulnerability samples. Furthermore, the development of LLMs specialized in vulnerability detection is challenging, particularly in environments characterized by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel framework ReVD that excels at mining vulnerability patterns through reasoning data synthesizing and vulnerability-specific preference optimization. Specifically, we construct forward and backward reasoning processes for vulnerability and corresponding fixed code, ensuring the synthesis of high-quality reasoning data. Moreover, we design the triplet supervised fine-tuning followed by curriculum online preference optimization for enabling ReVD to better understand vulnerability patterns. The extensive experiments conducted on PrimeVul and SVEN datasets demonstrate that ReVD sets new state-of-the-art for LLM-based software vulnerability detection, e.g., 12.24\%-22.77\% improvement in the accuracy.

Summary:
Introducing an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) for cloud-based AI systems, this paper combines Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to enhance fault recovery. The proposed method includes an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module for accurate fault mode identification and a DRL recovery strategy optimizer for learning fault response behaviors. The integration of LLM improves exploration efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning. A memory-guided meta-controller and fine-tuning strategy enable continuous adaptation to new failure modes.

Abstract: As the scale and complexity of cloud-based AI systems continue to increase, the detection and adaptive recovery of system faults have become the core challenges to ensure service reliability and continuity. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent Fault Self-Healing Mechanism (IFSHM) that integrates Large Language Model (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), aiming to realize a fault recovery framework with semantic understanding and policy optimization capabilities in cloud AI systems. On the basis of the traditional DRL-based control model, the proposed method constructs a two-stage hybrid architecture: (1) an LLM-driven fault semantic interpretation module, which can dynamically extract deep contextual semantics from multi-source logs and system indicators to accurately identify potential fault modes; (2) DRL recovery strategy optimizer, based on reinforcement learning, learns the dynamic matching of fault types and response behaviors in the cloud environment. The innovation of this method lies in the introduction of LLM for environment modeling and action space abstraction, which greatly improves the exploration efficiency and generalization ability of reinforcement learning. At the same time, a memory-guided meta-controller is introduced, combined with reinforcement learning playback and LLM prompt fine-tuning strategy, to achieve continuous adaptation to new failure modes and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results on the cloud fault injection platform show that compared with the existing DRL and rule methods, the IFSHM framework shortens the system recovery time by 37% with unknown fault scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise advanced vision language capabilities, yet their effectiveness in visually presented mathematics remains underexplored. This paper analyzes the development and evaluation of MLLMs for mathematical problem solving, focusing on diagrams, multilingual text, and symbolic notation. We then assess several models, including GPT 4o, Pixtral, Qwen VL, Llama 3.2 Vision variants, and Gemini 2.0 Flash in a multilingual Kangaroo style benchmark spanning English, French, Spanish, and Catalan. Our experiments reveal four key findings. First, overall precision remains moderate across geometry, visual algebra, logic, patterns, and combinatorics: no single model excels in every topic. Second, while most models see improved accuracy with questions that do not have images, the gain is often limited; performance for some remains nearly unchanged without visual input, indicating underutilization of diagrammatic information. Third, substantial variation exists across languages and difficulty levels: models frequently handle easier items but struggle with advanced geometry and combinatorial reasoning. Notably, Gemini 2.0 Flash achieves the highest precision on image based tasks, followed by Qwen VL 2.5 72B and GPT 4o, though none approach human level performance. Fourth, a complementary analysis aimed at distinguishing whether models reason or simply recite reveals that Gemini and GPT 4o stand out for their structured reasoning and consistent accuracy. In contrast, Pixtral and Llama exhibit less consistent reasoning, often defaulting to heuristics or randomness when unable to align their outputs with the given answer options.

Summary:<br />
The paper investigates the vulnerability of Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) and proposes a foundation attack model, HeTa, to generate generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs. By identifying shared vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective, the model aligns heterogeneity and extracts shared relation-aware attack units. This allows for a serialized relation-by-relation attack that can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily fine-tuned for new heterogeneous graphs (HGs). The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method. <div>
arXiv:2506.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are vulnerable, highlighting the need for tailored attacks to assess their robustness and ensure security. However, existing HGNN attacks often require complex retraining of parameters to generate specific perturbations for new scenarios. Recently, foundation models have opened new horizons for the generalization of graph neural networks by capturing shared semantics across various graph distributions. This leads us to ask:Can we design a foundation attack model for HGNNs that enables generalizable perturbations across different HGNNs, and quickly adapts to new heterogeneous graphs (HGs)? Empirical findings reveal that, despite significant differences in model design and parameter space, different HGNNs surprisingly share common vulnerability patterns from a relation-aware perspective. Therefore, we explore how to design foundation HGNN attack criteria by mining shared attack units. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-wise heterogeneous graph foundation attack model, HeTa. We introduce a foundation surrogate model to align heterogeneity and identify the importance of shared relation-aware attack units. Building on this, we implement a serialized relation-by-relation attack based on the identified relational weights. In this way, the perturbation can be transferred to various target HGNNs and easily fine-tuned for new HGs. Extensive experiments exhibit powerful attack performances and generalizability of our method.

Abstract: Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to function as a judge by making final rulings based on case claims and facts, which plays a vital role in the judicial domain for supporting court decision-making and improving judicial efficiency. However, existing methods often struggle with logical errors when conducting complex legal reasoning. We propose LegalReasoner, which enhances LJP reliability through step-wise verification and correction of the reasoning process. Specifically, it first identifies dispute points to decompose complex cases, and then conducts step-wise reasoning while employing a process verifier to validate each step's logic from correctness, progressiveness, and potential perspectives. When errors are detected, expert-designed attribution and resolution strategies are applied for correction. To fine-tune LegalReasoner, we release the LegalHK dataset, containing 58,130 Hong Kong court cases with detailed annotations of dispute points, step-by-step reasoning chains, and process verification labels. Experiments demonstrate that LegalReasoner significantly improves concordance with court decisions from 72.37 to 80.27 on LLAMA-3.1-70B.

<title>Fact in Fragments: Deconstructing Complex Claims via LLM-based Atomic Fact Extraction and Verification</title>

Abstract: Fact verification plays a vital role in combating misinformation by assessing the veracity of claims through evidence retrieval and reasoning. However, traditional methods struggle with complex claims requiring multi-hop reasoning over fragmented evidence, as they often rely on static decomposition strategies and surface-level semantic retrieval, which fail to capture the nuanced structure and intent of the claim. This results in accumulated reasoning errors, noisy evidence contamination, and limited adaptability to diverse claims, ultimately undermining verification accuracy in complex scenarios. To address this, we propose Atomic Fact Extraction and Verification (AFEV), a novel framework that iteratively decomposes complex claims into atomic facts, enabling fine-grained retrieval and adaptive reasoning. AFEV dynamically refines claim understanding and reduces error propagation through iterative fact extraction, reranks evidence to filter noise, and leverages context-specific demonstrations to guide the reasoning process. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that AFEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and interpretability.

Abstract: A major bottleneck in the training process for Zero-Shot Coordination (ZSC) agents is the generation of partner agents that are diverse in collaborative conventions. Current Cross-play Minimization (XPM) methods for population generation can be very computationally expensive and sample inefficient as the training objective requires sampling multiple types of trajectories. Each partner agent in the population is also trained from scratch, despite all of the partners in the population learning policies of the same coordination task. In this work, we propose that simulated trajectories from the dynamics model of an environment can drastically speed up the training process for XPM methods. We introduce XPM-WM, a framework for generating simulated trajectories for XPM via a learned World Model (WM). We show XPM with simulated trajectories removes the need to sample multiple trajectories. In addition, we show our proposed method can effectively generate partners with diverse conventions that match the performance of previous methods in terms of SP population training reward as well as training partners for ZSC agents. Our method is thus, significantly more sample efficient and scalable to a larger number of partners.

<title>Learning What Reinforcement Learning Can't: Interleaved Online Fine-Tuning for Hardest Questions</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning have shown that sophisticated behaviors such as planning and self-reflection can emerge through reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite these successes, RL in its current form remains insufficient to induce capabilities that exceed the limitations of the base model, as it is primarily optimized based on existing knowledge of the model rather than facilitating the acquisition of new information. To address this limitation, we employ supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to learn what RL cannot, which enables the incorporation of new knowledge and reasoning patterns by leveraging high-quality demonstration data. We analyze the training dynamics of RL and SFT for LLM reasoning and find that RL excels at maintaining and improving performance on questions within the model's original capabilities, while SFT is more effective at enabling progress on questions beyond the current scope of the model. Motivated by the complementary strengths of RL and SFT, we introduce a novel training approach, \textbf{ReLIFT} (\textbf{Re}inforcement \textbf{L}earning \textbf{I}nterleaved with Online \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning). In ReLIFT, the model is primarily trained using RL, but when it encounters challenging questions, high-quality solutions are collected for fine-tuning, and the training process alternates between RL and fine-tuning to enhance the model's reasoning abilities. ReLIFT achieves an average improvement of over +5.2 points across five competition-level benchmarks and one out-of-distribution benchmark compared to other zero-RL models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ReLIFT outperforms both RL and SFT while using only 13\% of the detailed demonstration data, highlighting its scalability. These results provide compelling evidence that ReLIFT overcomes the fundamental limitations of RL and underscores the significant potential.

<title>Coordinating Search-Informed Reasoning and Reasoning-Guided Search in Claim Verification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop claim verification is inherently challenging, requiring multi-step reasoning to construct verification chains while iteratively searching for information to uncover hidden bridging facts. This process is fundamentally interleaved, as effective reasoning relies on dynamically retrieved evidence, while effective search demands reasoning to refine queries based on partial information. To achieve this, we propose Hierarchical Agent Reasoning and Information Search (HARIS), explicitly modeling the coordinated process of reasoning-driven searching and search-informed reasoning. HARIS consists of a high-level reasoning agent that focuses on constructing the main verification chain, generating factual questions when more information is needed, and a low-level search agent that iteratively retrieves more information, refining its search based on intermediate findings. This design allows each agent to specialize in its respective task, enhancing verification accuracy and interpretability. HARIS is trained using reinforcement learning with outcome-based rewards. Experimental results on the EX-FEVER and HOVER benchmarks demonstrate that HARIS achieves strong performance, greatly advancing multi-hop claim verification.

<title>Curriculum Learning With Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage For Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07548</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved strong performance in cooperative adversarial tasks. However, most existing methods typically train agents against fixed opponent strategies and rely on such meta-static difficulty conditions, which limits their adaptability to changing environments and often leads to suboptimal policies. Inspired by the success of curriculum learning (CL) in supervised tasks, we propose a dynamic CL framework for MARL that employs an self-adaptive difficulty adjustment mechanism. This mechanism continuously modulates opponent strength based on real-time agent training performance, allowing agents to progressively learn from easier to more challenging scenarios. However, the dynamic nature of CL introduces instability due to nonstationary environments and sparse global rewards. To address this challenge, we develop a Counterfactual Group Relative Policy Advantage (CGRPA), which is tightly coupled with the curriculum by providing intrinsic credit signals that reflect each agent's impact under evolving task demands. CGRPA constructs a counterfactual advantage function that isolates individual contributions within group behavior, facilitating more reliable policy updates throughout the curriculum. CGRPA evaluates each agent's contribution through constructing counterfactual action advantage function, providing intrinsic rewards that enhance credit assignment and stabilize learning under non-stationary conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method improves both training stability and final performance, achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/CL2MARL-SMAC.

Abstract: Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) is crucial for digitizing chemical knowledge by converting molecular images into machine-readable formats. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) have shown potential in this task, their image-captioning approach often struggles with complex molecular structures and inconsistent annotations. To overcome these challenges, we introduce GTR-Mol-VLM, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (1) the \textit{Graph Traversal as Visual Chain of Thought} mechanism that emulates human reasoning by incrementally parsing molecular graphs through sequential atom-bond predictions, and (2) the data-centric principle of \textit{Faithfully Recognize What You've Seen}, which addresses the mismatch between abbreviated structures in images and their expanded annotations. To support model development, we constructed GTR-CoT-1.3M, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset with meticulously corrected annotations, and introduced MolRec-Bench, the first benchmark designed for a fine-grained evaluation of graph-parsing accuracy in OCSR. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GTR-Mol-VLM achieves superior results compared to specialist models, chemistry-domain VLMs, and commercial general-purpose VLMs. Notably, in scenarios involving molecular images with functional group abbreviations, GTR-Mol-VLM outperforms the second-best baseline by approximately 14 percentage points, both in SMILES-based and graph-based metrics. We hope that this work will drive OCSR technology to more effectively meet real-world needs, thereby advancing the fields of cheminformatics and AI for Science. We will release GTR-CoT at https://github.com/opendatalab/GTR-CoT.

<title>SAFEFLOW: A Principled Protocol for Trustworthy and Transactional Autonomous Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and multi-modal tool use. Despite their growing capabilities, today's agent frameworks remain fragile, lacking principled mechanisms for secure information flow, reliability, and multi-agent coordination. In this work, we introduce SAFEFLOW, a new protocol-level framework for building trustworthy LLM/VLM-based agents. SAFEFLOW enforces fine-grained information flow control (IFC), precisely tracking provenance, integrity, and confidentiality of all the data exchanged between agents, tools, users, and environments. By constraining LLM reasoning to respect these security labels, SAFEFLOW prevents untrusted or adversarial inputs from contaminating high-integrity decisions. To ensure robustness in concurrent multi-agent settings, SAFEFLOW introduces transactional execution, conflict resolution, and secure scheduling over shared state, preserving global consistency across agents. We further introduce mechanisms, including write-ahead logging, rollback, and secure caches, that further enhance resilience against runtime errors and policy violations. To validate the performances, we built SAFEFLOWBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate agent reliability under adversarial, noisy, and concurrent operational conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that agents built with SAFEFLOW maintain impressive task performance and security guarantees even in hostile environments, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art. Together, SAFEFLOW and SAFEFLOWBENCH lay the groundwork for principled, robust, and secure agent ecosystems, advancing the frontier of reliable autonomy.

Abstract: This paper introduces PROTEUS, a fully automated system that produces data-driven hypotheses from raw data files. We apply PROTEUS to clinical proteogenomics, a field where effective downstream data analysis and hypothesis proposal is crucial for producing novel discoveries. PROTEUS uses separate modules to simulate different stages of the scientific process, from open-ended data exploration to specific statistical analysis and hypothesis proposal. It formulates research directions, tools, and results in terms of relationships between biological entities, using unified graph structures to manage complex research processes. We applied PROTEUS to 10 clinical multiomics datasets from published research, arriving at 360 total hypotheses. Results were evaluated through external data validation and automatic open-ended scoring. Through exploratory and iterative research, the system can navigate high-throughput and heterogeneous multiomics data to arrive at hypotheses that balance reliability and novelty. In addition to accelerating multiomic analysis, PROTEUS represents a path towards tailoring general autonomous systems to specialized scientific domains to achieve open-ended hypothesis generation from data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly from conversational problem solving to addressing real-world tasks involving tool use, such as software engineering (SWE). Recent LLM-powered toolkits, such as OpenAI Codex and Cursor, have offered end-to-end automation of the software development process. However, building effective SWE agents remains challenging due to the lack of high-quality training data and effective test cases. To address this issue, we present SWE-Dev, an SWE agent built upon open-source LLMs. First, we develop a robust pipeline to synthesize test cases for patch evaluation. Second, we scale up agent trajectories to construct the training data for building SWE-Dev. Experiments on the SWE-bench-Verified benchmark show that the SWE-Dev models can achieve top performance among all open SWE agents. Specifically, the success rates of the SWE-Dev 7B and 32B parameter models reach 23.4% and 36.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art open-source models. All code, models, and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/THUDM/SWE-Dev.

<title>MCPWorld: A Unified Benchmarking Testbed for API, GUI, and Hybrid Computer Use Agents</title>

arXiv:2506.07672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (M)LLM-powered computer use agents (CUA) are emerging as a transformative technique to automate human-computer interaction. However, existing CUA benchmarks predominantly target GUI agents, whose evaluation methods are susceptible to UI changes and ignore function interactions exposed by application APIs, e.g., Model Context Protocol (MCP). To this end, we propose MCPWorld, the first automatic CUA testbed for API, GUI, and API-GUI hybrid agents. A key principle of MCPWorld is the use of "white-box apps", i.e., those with source code availability and can be revised/re-compiled as needed (e.g., adding MCP support), with two notable advantages:
  (1) It greatly broadens the design space of CUA, such as what and how the app features to be exposed/extracted as CUA-callable APIs.
  (2) It allows MCPWorld to programmatically verify task completion by directly monitoring application behavior through techniques like dynamic code instrumentation, offering robust, accurate CUA evaluation decoupled from specific agent implementations or UI states.
  Currently, MCPWorld includes 201 well curated and annotated user tasks, covering diversified use cases and difficulty levels. MCPWorld is also fully containerized with GPU acceleration support for flexible adoption on different OS/hardware environments. Our preliminary experiments, using a representative LLM-powered CUA framework, achieve 75.12% task completion accuracy, simultaneously providing initial evidence on the practical effectiveness of agent automation leveraging MCP. Overall, we anticipate MCPWorld to facilitate and standardize the benchmarking of next-generation computer use agents that can leverage rich external tools. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/SAAgent/MCPWorld.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks have proven effective for assessing the performance of fully trained large language models. However, we find striking differences in the early training stages of small models, where benchmarks often fail to provide meaningful or discriminative signals. To explore how these differences arise, this competition tackles the challenge of designing scientific knowledge evaluation tasks specifically tailored for measuring early training progress of language models. Participants are invited to develop novel evaluation methodologies or adapt existing benchmarks to better capture performance differences among language models. To support this effort, we provide three pre-trained small models (0.5B, 1B, and 3B parameters), along with intermediate checkpoints sampled during training up to 200B tokens. All experiments and development work can be run on widely available free cloud-based GPU platforms, making participation accessible to researchers with limited computational resources. Submissions will be evaluated based on three criteria: the quality of the performance signal they produce, the consistency of model rankings at 1 trillion tokens of training, and their relevance to the scientific knowledge domain. By promoting the design of tailored evaluation strategies for early training, this competition aims to attract a broad range of participants from various disciplines, including those who may not be machine learning experts or have access to dedicated GPU resources. Ultimately, this initiative seeks to make foundational LLM research more systematic and benchmark-informed from the earliest phases of model development.

<title>RSafe: Incentivizing proactive reasoning to build robust and adaptive LLM safeguards</title>

arXiv:2506.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit vulnerabilities despite deliberate safety alignment efforts, posing significant risks to users and society. To safeguard against the risk of policy-violating content, system-level moderation via external guard models-designed to monitor LLM inputs and outputs and block potentially harmful content-has emerged as a prevalent mitigation strategy. Existing approaches of training guard models rely heavily on extensive human curated datasets and struggle with out-of-distribution threats, such as emerging harmful categories or jailbreak attacks. To address these limitations, we propose RSafe, an adaptive reasoning-based safeguard that conducts guided safety reasoning to provide robust protection within the scope of specified safety policies. RSafe operates in two stages: 1) guided reasoning, where it analyzes safety risks of input content through policy-guided step-by-step reasoning, and 2) reinforced alignment, where rule-based RL optimizes its reasoning paths to align with accurate safety prediction. This two-stage training paradigm enables RSafe to internalize safety principles to generalize safety protection capability over unseen or adversarial safety violation scenarios. During inference, RSafe accepts user-specified safety policies to provide enhanced safeguards tailored to specific safety requirements.

Abstract: Some formal aspects of the Semantic Spacetime graph model are presented, with reference to its use for directed knowledge representations and process modelling. A finite $\gamma(3,4)$ representation is defined to form a closed set of operations that can scale to any degree of semantic complexity. The Semantic Spacetime postulates bring predictability with minimal constraints to pathways in graphs. The ubiquitous appearance of absorbing states in any partial graph means that a graph process leaks information. The issue is closely associated with the issue of division by zero, which signals a loss of closure and the need for manual injection of remedial information. The Semantic Spacetime model (and its Promise Theory) origins help to clarify how such absorbing states are associated with boundary information where intentionality can enter.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization is fundamental in complex decision-making tasks. Traditional algorithms, while effective, often demand extensive problem-specific modeling and struggle to adapt to nonlinear structures. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enhanced explainability, adaptability, and reasoning. This work proposes Reflective Evolution of Multi-objective Heuristics (REMoH), a novel framework integrating NSGA-II with LLM-based heuristic generation. A key innovation is a reflection mechanism that uses clustering and search-space reflection to guide the creation of diverse, high-quality heuristics, improving convergence and maintaining solution diversity. The approach is evaluated on the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) in-depth benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods using three instance datasets: Dauzere, Barnes, and Brandimarte. Results demonstrate that REMoH achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art approaches with reduced modeling effort and enhanced adaptability. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to augment traditional optimization, offering greater flexibility, interpretability, and robustness in multi-objective scenarios.

We propose a unified approach to integrating metacognition within the CMC. We propose that metacognition involves reasoning over explicit representations of an agent's cognitive capabilities and processes in working memory. Our proposal exploits the existing cognitive capabilities of the CMC, making minimal extensions in the structure and information available within working memory. We provide examples of metacognition within our proposal.

Abstract: Human reasoning is flexible, adaptive, and grounded in prior experience-qualities that large language models (LLMs) still struggle to emulate. Existing methods either explore diverse reasoning paths at inference time or search for optimal workflows through expensive operations, but both fall short in leveraging multiple reusable strategies in a structured, efficient manner. We propose Guideline Forest, a framework that enhances LLMs reasoning by inducing structured reasoning strategies-called guidelines-from verified examples and executing them via step-wise aggregation. Unlike test-time search or single-path distillation, our method draws on verified reasoning experiences by inducing reusable guidelines and expanding each into diverse variants. Much like human reasoning, these variants reflect alternative thought patterns, are executed in parallel, refined via self-correction, and aggregated step by step-enabling the model to adaptively resolve uncertainty and synthesize robust solutions.We evaluate Guideline Forest on four benchmarks-GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, and HumanEval-spanning mathematical and programmatic reasoning. Guideline Forest consistently outperforms strong baselines, including CoT, ReAct, ToT, FoT, and AFlow. Ablation studies further highlight the effectiveness of multi-path reasoning and stepwise aggregation, underscoring the Guideline Forest's adaptability and generalization potential.

Abstract: Multi-digit addition is a clear probe of the computational power of large language models. To dissect the internal arithmetic processes in LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, we combine linear probing with logit-lens inspection. Inspired by the step-by-step manner in which humans perform addition, we propose and analyze a coherent four-stage trajectory in the forward pass:Formula-structure representations become linearly decodable first, while the answer token is still far down the candidate list.Core computational features then emerge prominently.At deeper activation layers, numerical abstractions of the result become clearer, enabling near-perfect detection and decoding of the individual digits in the sum.Near the output, the model organizes and generates the final content, with the correct token reliably occupying the top rank.This trajectory suggests a hierarchical process that favors internal computation over rote memorization. We release our code and data to facilitate reproducibility.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in general domains but perform poorly in some specific domains due to a lack of domain-specific data, such as image-text data or vedio-text data. In some specific domains, there is abundant graphic and textual data scattered around, but lacks standardized arrangement. In the field of medical ultrasound, there are ultrasonic diagnostic books, ultrasonic clinical guidelines, ultrasonic diagnostic reports, and so on. However, these ultrasonic materials are often saved in the forms of PDF, images, etc., and cannot be directly used for the training of MLLMs. This paper proposes a novel image-text reasoning supervised fine-tuning data generation pipeline to create specific domain quadruplets (image, question, thinking trace, and answer) from domain-specific materials. A medical ultrasound domain dataset ReMUD is established, containing over 45,000 reasoning and non-reasoning supervised fine-tuning Question Answering (QA) and Visual Question Answering (VQA) data. The ReMUD-7B model, fine-tuned on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, outperforms general-domain MLLMs in medical ultrasound field. To facilitate research, the ReMUD dataset, data generation codebase, and ReMUD-7B parameters will be released at https://github.com/ShiDaizi/ReMUD, addressing the data shortage issue in specific domain MLLMs.

<title>A Temporal FRBR/FRBRoo-Based Model for Component-Level Versioning of Legal Norms</title>

Abstract: Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical challenge, particularly in tracking the diachronic evolution of their hierarchical components (e.g., articles, paragraphs). While foundational frameworks like FRBR/FRBRoo and standards like Akoma Ntoso model legal documents at a macro level, they lack native mechanisms for granular, component-level versioning. This limitation hinders the deterministic point-in-time reconstruction of legal texts, a fundamental capability for reliable Legal Tech and AI applications. This paper proposes a structured, temporal model that extends the FRBRoo framework to address this gap. It introduces specialized subclasses of Expressio - Temporal Version (TV) and Language Version (LV - to represent the state of a legal norm and its linguistic variations at specific points in time. The model applies this same paradigm hierarchically, introducing Component Work (CW), Component Temporal Version (CTV), and Component Language Version (CLV) to track the lifecycle of individual articles, paragraphs, and clauses. Using the Brazilian Federal Constitution as a case study, the paper demonstrates how each amendment creates new Component Temporal Versions for affected provisions, while unaffected components retain their existing versions. This fine-grained, time-aware architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a robust foundation for developing advanced legal information systems, knowledge graphs, and AI tools capable of accurate historical analysis and impact assessment, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revitalized philosophical debates surrounding artificial intelligence. Two of the most fundamental challenges - namely, the Frame Problem and the Symbol Grounding Problem - have historically been viewed as unsolvable within traditional symbolic AI systems. This study investigates whether modern LLMs possess the cognitive capacities required to address these problems. To do so, I designed two benchmark tasks reflecting the philosophical core of each problem, administered them under zero-shot conditions to 13 prominent LLMs (both closed and open-source), and assessed the quality of the models' outputs across five trials each. Responses were scored along multiple criteria, including contextual reasoning, semantic coherence, and information filtering. The results demonstrate that while open-source models showed variability in performance due to differences in model size, quantization, and instruction tuning, several closed models consistently achieved high scores. These findings suggest that select modern LLMs may be acquiring capacities sufficient to produce meaningful and stable responses to these long-standing theoretical challenges.

Abstract: In dynamic environments, the rapid obsolescence of pre-existing environmental knowledge creates a gap between an agent's internal model and the evolving reality of its operational context. This disparity between prior and updated environmental valuations fundamentally limits the effectiveness of autonomous decision-making. To bridge this gap, the contextual bias of human domain stakeholders, who naturally accumulate insights through direct, real-time observation, becomes indispensable. However, translating their nuanced, and context-rich input into actionable intelligence for autonomous systems remains an open challenge. To address this, we propose LUCIFER (Language Understanding and Context-Infused Framework for Exploration and Behavior Refinement), a domain-agnostic framework that integrates a hierarchical decision-making architecture with reinforcement learning (RL) and large language models (LLMs) into a unified system. This architecture mirrors how humans decompose complex tasks, enabling a high-level planner to coordinate specialised sub-agents, each focused on distinct objectives and temporally interdependent actions. Unlike traditional applications where LLMs are limited to single role, LUCIFER integrates them in two synergistic roles: as context extractors, structuring verbal stakeholder input into domain-aware representations that influence decision-making through an attention space mechanism aligning LLM-derived insights with the agent's learning process, and as zero-shot exploration facilitators guiding the agent's action selection process during exploration. We benchmark various LLMs in both roles and demonstrate that LUCIFER improves exploration efficiency and decision quality, outperforming flat, goal-conditioned policies. Our findings show the potential of context-driven decision-making, where autonomous systems leverage human contextual knowledge for operational success.

Abstract: Inequality proving, crucial across diverse scientific and mathematical fields, tests advanced reasoning skills such as discovering tight bounds and strategic theorem application. This makes it a distinct, demanding frontier for large language models (LLMs), offering insights beyond general mathematical problem-solving. Progress in this area is hampered by existing datasets that are often scarce, synthetic, or rigidly formal. We address this by proposing an informal yet verifiable task formulation, recasting inequality proving into two automatically checkable subtasks: bound estimation and relation prediction. Building on this, we release IneqMath, an expert-curated dataset of Olympiad-level inequalities, including a test set and training corpus enriched with step-wise solutions and theorem annotations. We also develop a novel LLM-as-judge evaluation framework, combining a final-answer judge with four step-wise judges designed to detect common reasoning flaws. A systematic evaluation of 29 leading LLMs on IneqMath reveals a surprising reality: even top models like o1 achieve less than 10% overall accuracy under step-wise scrutiny; this is a drop of up to 65.5% from their accuracy considering only final answer equivalence. This discrepancy exposes fragile deductive chains and a critical gap for current LLMs between merely finding an answer and constructing a rigorous proof. Scaling model size and increasing test-time computation yield limited gains in overall proof correctness. Instead, our findings highlight promising research directions such as theorem-guided reasoning and self-refinement. Code and data are available at https://ineqmath.github.io/.

Abstract: Foundation model fine-tuning faces a fundamental challenge: existing AutoML platforms rely on single optimisation strategies that explore only a fraction of viable hyperparameter configurations. In this white paper, We introduce Gradients, a decentralised AutoML platform that transforms hyperparameter optimisation into a competitive marketplace where independent miners compete to discover optimal configurations. Economic incentives align individual exploration with collective optimisation goals, driving systematic investigation of hyperparameter regions that centralised methods miss. We evaluate our approach across 180 controlled experiments spanning diverse model architectures (70M to 70B parameters) and task types. Gradients achieves an 82.8\% win rate against HuggingFace AutoTrain and 100\% against TogetherAI, Databricks, and Google Cloud, with mean improvements of 11.8\% and 42.1\% respectively. Complex reasoning and retrieval tasks show particularly strong gains of 30-40\%, whilst diffusion models achieve 23.4\% improvements for person-specific generation. These results demonstrate that competitive, economically-driven approaches can systematically discover superior configurations that centralised AutoML consistently miss.

<title>Reinforcing Multimodal Understanding and Generation with Dual Self-rewards</title>

Abstract: Building upon large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) unify cross-model understanding and generation into a single framework. However, LMMs still struggle to achieve accurate image-text alignment, prone to generating text responses contradicting the visual input or failing to follow the text-to-image prompts. Current solutions require external supervision (e.g., human feedback or reward models) and only address unidirectional tasks-either understanding or generation. In this work, based on the observation that understanding and generation are inverse dual tasks, we introduce a self-supervised dual reward mechanism to reinforce the understanding and generation capabilities of LMMs. Specifically, we sample multiple outputs for a given input in one task domain, then reverse the input-output pairs to compute the dual likelihood of the model as self-rewards for optimization. Extensive experimental results on visual understanding and generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method can effectively enhance the performance of the model without any external supervision, especially achieving remarkable improvements in text-to-image tasks.

<title>$\tau^2$-Bench: Evaluating Conversational Agents in a Dual-Control Environment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.07982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for conversational AI agents simulate single-control environments, where only the AI agent can use tools to interact with the world, while the user remains a passive information provider. This differs from real-world scenarios like technical support, where users need to actively participate in modifying the state of the (shared) world. In order to address this gap, we introduce $\tau^2$-bench, with four key contributions:
  1) A novel Telecom dual-control domain modeled as a Dec-POMDP, where both agent and user make use of tools to act in a shared, dynamic environment that tests both agent coordination and communication,
  2) A compositional task generator that programmatically creates diverse, verifiable tasks from atomic components, ensuring domain coverage and controlled complexity,
  3) A reliable user simulator tightly coupled with the environment, whose behavior is constrained by tools and observable states, improving simulation fidelity,
  4) Fine-grained analysis of agent performance through multiple ablations including separating errors arising from reasoning vs communication/coordination.
  In particular, our experiments show significant performance drops when agents shift from no-user to dual-control, highlighting the challenges of guiding users. Overall, $\tau^2$-bench provides a controlled testbed for agents that must both reason effectively and guide user actions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown great potential in revolutionizing Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. However, existing GUI models mostly rely on learning from nearly error-free offline trajectories, thus lacking reflection and error recovery capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose GUI-Reflection, a novel framework that explicitly integrates self-reflection and error correction capabilities into end-to-end multimodal GUI models throughout dedicated training stages: GUI-specific pre-training, offline supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and online reflection tuning. GUI-reflection enables self-reflection behavior emergence with fully automated data generation and learning processes without requiring any human annotation. Specifically, 1) we first propose scalable data pipelines to automatically construct reflection and error correction data from existing successful trajectories. While existing GUI models mainly focus on grounding and UI understanding ability, we propose the GUI-Reflection Task Suite to learn and evaluate reflection-oriented abilities explicitly. 2) Furthermore, we built a diverse and efficient environment for online training and data collection of GUI models on mobile devices. 3) We also present an iterative online reflection tuning algorithm leveraging the proposed environment, enabling the model to continuously enhance its reflection and error correction abilities. Our framework equips GUI agents with self-reflection and correction capabilities, paving the way for more robust, adaptable, and intelligent GUI automation, with all data, models, environments, and tools to be released publicly.

<title>Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Text-Video Retrieval with Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11082</link>

Abstract: In recent years, the explosion of web videos makes text-video retrieval increasingly essential and popular for video filtering, recommendation, and search. Text-video retrieval aims to rank relevant text/video higher than irrelevant ones. The core of this task is to precisely measure the cross-modal similarity between texts and videos. Recently, contrastive learning methods have shown promising results for text-video retrieval, most of which focus on the construction of positive and negative pairs to learn text and video representations. Nevertheless, they do not pay enough attention to hard negative pairs and lack the ability to model different levels of semantic similarity. To address these two issues, this paper improves contrastive learning using two novel techniques. First, to exploit hard examples for robust discriminative power, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Attention-Enhanced Module (DMAE) to mine hard negative pairs from textual and visual clues. By further introducing a Negative-aware InfoNCE (NegNCE) loss, we are able to adaptively identify all these hard negatives and explicitly highlight their impacts in the training loss. Second, our work argues that triplet samples can better model fine-grained semantic similarity compared to pairwise samples. We thereby present a new Triplet Partial Margin Contrastive Learning (TPM-CL) module to construct partial order triplet samples by automatically generating fine-grained hard negatives for matched text-video pairs. The proposed TPM-CL designs an adaptive token masking strategy with cross-modal interaction to model subtle semantic differences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods on four widely-used text-video retrieval datasets, including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and ActivityNet.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently seen significant advancements through integrating with Large Language Models (LLMs). The VLMs, which process image and text modalities simultaneously, have demonstrated the ability to learn and understand the interaction between images and texts across various multi-modal tasks. Reverse designing, which could be defined as a complex vision-language task, aims to predict the edits and their parameters, given a source image, an edited version, and an optional high-level textual edit description. This task requires VLMs to comprehend the interplay between the source image, the edited version, and the optional textual context simultaneously, going beyond traditional vision-language tasks. In this paper, we extend and fine-tune MiniGPT-4 for the reverse designing task. Our experiments demonstrate the extensibility of off-the-shelf VLMs, specifically MiniGPT-4, for more complex tasks such as reverse designing. Code is available at this \href{https://github.com/VahidAz/MiniGPT-Reverse-Designing}

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation (MT) presents a diversity of community needs and application challenges that remain poorly understood. To complement surveys and focus groups, which tend to rely on small samples of respondents, we propose an observational study on actual usage patterns of tetun$.$org, a specialized MT service for the Tetun language, which is the lingua franca in Timor-Leste. Our analysis of 100,000 translation requests reveals patterns that challenge assumptions based on existing corpora. We find that users, many of them students on mobile devices, typically translate text from a high-resource language into Tetun across diverse domains including science, healthcare, and daily life. This contrasts sharply with available Tetun corpora, which are dominated by news articles covering government and social issues. Our results suggest that MT systems for institutionalized minority languages like Tetun should prioritize accuracy on domains relevant to educational contexts, in the high-resource to low-resource direction. More broadly, this study demonstrates how observational analysis can inform low-resource language technology development, by grounding research in practical community needs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs)-based query expansion for information retrieval augments queries with generated hypothetical documents with LLMs. However, its performance relies heavily on the scale of the language models (LMs), necessitating larger, more advanced LLMs. This approach is costly, computationally intensive, and often has limited accessibility. To address these limitations, we introduce GOLFer - Smaller LMs-Generated Documents Hallucination Filter & Combiner - a novel method leveraging smaller open-source LMs for query expansion. GOLFer comprises two modules: a hallucination filter and a documents combiner. The former detects and removes non-factual and inconsistent sentences in generated documents, a common issue with smaller LMs, while the latter combines the filtered content with the query using a weight vector to balance their influence. We evaluate GOLFer alongside dominant LLM-based query expansion methods on three web search and ten low-resource datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLFer consistently outperforms other methods using smaller LMs, and maintains competitive performance against methods using large-size LLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: We present STARFlow, a scalable generative model based on normalizing flows that achieves strong performance in high-resolution image synthesis. The core of STARFlow is Transformer Autoregressive Flow (TARFlow), which combines the expressive power of normalizing flows with the structured modeling capabilities of Autoregressive Transformers. We first establish the theoretical universality of TARFlow for modeling continuous distributions. Building on this foundation, we introduce several key architectural and algorithmic innovations to significantly enhance scalability: (1) a deep-shallow design, wherein a deep Transformer block captures most of the model representational capacity, complemented by a few shallow Transformer blocks that are computationally efficient yet substantially beneficial; (2) modeling in the latent space of pretrained autoencoders, which proves more effective than direct pixel-level modeling; and (3) a novel guidance algorithm that significantly boosts sample quality. Crucially, our model remains an end-to-end normalizing flow, enabling exact maximum likelihood training in continuous spaces without discretization. STARFlow achieves competitive performance in both class-conditional and text-conditional image generation tasks, approaching state-of-the-art diffusion models in sample quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first successful demonstration of normalizing flows operating effectively at this scale and resolution.

Abstract: Global population aging presents increasing challenges to healthcare systems, with coronary artery disease (CAD) responsible for approximately 17.8 million deaths annually, making it a leading cause of global mortality. As CAD is largely preventable, early detection and proactive management are essential. In this work, we introduce DigitalShadow, an advanced early warning system for CAD, powered by a fine-tuned facial foundation model. The system is pre-trained on 21 million facial images and subsequently fine-tuned into LiveCAD, a specialized CAD risk assessment model trained on 7,004 facial images from 1,751 subjects across four hospitals in China. DigitalShadow functions passively and contactlessly, extracting facial features from live video streams without requiring active user engagement. Integrated with a personalized database, it generates natural language risk reports and individualized health recommendations. With privacy as a core design principle, DigitalShadow supports local deployment to ensure secure handling of user data.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI research make it increasingly plausible that artificial agents with consequential real-world impact will soon operate beyond tightly controlled environments. Ensuring that these agents are not only safe but that they adhere to broader normative expectations is thus an urgent interdisciplinary challenge. Multiple fields -- notably AI Safety, AI Alignment, and Machine Ethics -- claim to contribute to this task. However, the conceptual boundaries and interrelations among these domains remain vague, leaving researchers without clear guidance in positioning their work.
  To address this meta-challenge, we develop a structured conceptual framework for understanding AI alignment. Rather than focusing solely on alignment goals, we introduce a taxonomy distinguishing the alignment aim (safety, ethicality, legality, etc.), scope (outcome vs. execution), and constituency (individual vs. collective). This structural approach reveals multiple legitimate alignment configurations, providing a foundation for practical and philosophical integration across domains, and clarifying what it might mean for an agent to be aligned all-things-considered.

Abstract: Time-series data is a vital modality within data science communities. This is particularly valuable in financial applications, where it helps in detecting patterns, understanding market behavior, and making informed decisions based on historical data. Recent advances in language modeling have led to the rise of time-series pre-trained models that are trained on vast collections of datasets and applied to diverse tasks across financial domains. However, across financial applications, existing time-series pre-trained models have not shown boosts in performance over simple finance benchmarks in both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. This phenomenon occurs because of a i) lack of financial data within the pre-training stage, and ii) the negative transfer effect due to inherently different time-series patterns across domains. Furthermore, time-series data is continuous, noisy, and can be collected at varying frequencies and with varying lags across different variables, making this data more challenging to model than languages. To address the above problems, we introduce a Pre-trained MoDEL for FINance TimE-series (Delphyne). Delphyne achieves competitive performance to existing foundation and full-shot models with few fine-tuning steps on publicly available datasets, and also shows superior performances on various financial tasks.

Abstract: High-content screening (HCS) assays based on high-throughput microscopy techniques such as Cell Painting have enabled the interrogation of cells' morphological responses to perturbations at an unprecedented scale. The collection of such data promises to facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different perturbations and their effects on cellular state. Towards achieving this goal, recent advances in cross-modal contrastive learning could, in theory, be leveraged to learn a unified latent space that aligns perturbations with their corresponding morphological effects. However, the application of such methods to HCS data is not straightforward due to substantial differences in the semantics of Cell Painting images compared to natural images, and the difficulty of representing different classes of perturbations (e.g., small molecule vs CRISPR gene knockout) in a single latent space. In response to these challenges, here we introduce CellCLIP, a cross-modal contrastive learning framework for HCS data. CellCLIP leverages pre-trained image encoders coupled with a novel channel encoding scheme to better capture relationships between different microscopy channels in image embeddings, along with natural language encoders for representing perturbations. Our framework outperforms current open-source models, demonstrating the best performance in both cross-modal retrieval and biologically meaningful downstream tasks while also achieving significant reductions in computation time.

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are essential tools for solving planning and scheduling problems across critical industries such as construction, manufacturing, and logistics. However, their widespread adoption is limited by long computational times, especially in large-scale, real-time scenarios. To address this, we present a learning-based framework that leverages Behavior Cloning (BC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), producing high-quality initial solutions for warm-starting MILP solvers in Multi-Agent Task Allocation and Scheduling Problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces optimization time and variance compared to traditional techniques while maintaining solution quality and feasibility.

Abstract: During the preference optimization of large language models (LLMs), distribution shifts may arise between newly generated model samples and the data used to train the reward model (RM). This shift reduces the efficacy of the RM, which in turn negatively impacts the performance of the policy model (PM). To address this challenge, we propose Mutual-Taught, a self-training method that iteratively improves both the PM and RM without requiring additional human annotation. Our approach mirrors the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E-step, the PM is updated using feedback from the current RM, guiding the PM toward a better approximation of the latent optimal preference distribution. In the M-step, we update the RM by constructing training data from the outputs of the PM before and after the E-step update. This process ensures that the RM adapts to the evolving policy distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that this iterative approach leads to consistent improvements in both models. Specifically, our 8B policy model, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct-MT, achieves a length-controlled win rate of 54.1\% on AlpacaEval-2, while our 8B reward model, FsfairX-LLaMA3-RM-MT, performs on par with GPT-4o-2024-08-06 on RewardBench.

Abstract: Agencies such as Standard & Poor's and Moody's provide bank credit ratings that influence economic stability and decision-making by stakeholders. Accurate and timely predictions support informed decision-making, regulatory actions, and investor protection. However, a complete interbank connection graph is often unavailable due to privacy concerns, complicating the direct application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for rating prediction. our research utilizes persistent homology to construct a network that captures relationships among banks and combines this with a traditional lending network to create a heterogeneous network that integrates information from both sources, leading to improved predictions. Experiments on a global, real-world dataset validate the effectiveness of HTGNN. This research has implications for investors and regulatory bodies in enhancing proactive risk mitigation and the implementation of effective market interventions.The code can be find at https://github.com/Liu-Jun-Yi/HTGNN.

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights. GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

<title>dLLM-Cache: Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models with Adaptive Caching</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive Models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of Large Language Models. Recently, a new paradigm has emerged in the form of diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs), which generate text by iteratively denoising masked segments. This approach has shown significant advantages and potential. However, dLLMs suffer from high inference latency. Traditional ARM acceleration techniques, such as Key-Value caching, are incompatible with dLLMs due to their bidirectional attention mechanism. To address this specific challenge, our work begins with a key observation that dLLM inference involves a static prompt and a partially dynamic response, where most tokens remain stable across adjacent denoising steps. Based on this, we propose dLLM-Cache, a training-free adaptive caching framework that combines long-interval prompt caching with partial response updates guided by feature similarity. This design enables efficient reuse of intermediate computations without compromising model performance. Extensive experiments on representative dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B and Dream 7B, show that dLLM-Cache achieves up to 9.1 x speedup over standard inference without compromising output quality. Notably, our method brings dLLM inference latency close to that of ARMs under many settings. Codes are provided in the supplementary material and will be released publicly on GitHub.

Abstract: We introduce Jacobi-KAN-DGCNN, a framework that integrates Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN) with Jacobi Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) for the classification of three-dimensional point clouds. This method replaces Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) layers with adaptable univariate polynomial expansions within a streamlined DGCNN architecture, circumventing deep levels for both MLP and KAN to facilitate a layer-by-layer comparison. In comparative experiments on the ModelNet40 dataset, KAN layers employing Jacobi polynomials outperform the traditional linear layer-based DGCNN baseline in terms of accuracy and convergence speed, while maintaining parameter efficiency. Our results demonstrate that higher polynomial degrees do not automatically improve performance, highlighting the need for further theoretical and empirical investigation to fully understand the interactions between polynomial bases, degrees, and the mechanisms of graph-based learning.

Abstract: Scheduling echocardiographic exams in a hospital presents significant challenges due to non-deterministic factors (e.g., patient no-shows, patient arrival times, diverse exam durations, etc.) and asymmetric resource constraints between fetal and non-fetal patient streams. To address these challenges, we first conducted extensive pre-processing on one week of operational data from the Echo Laboratory at Stanford University's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, to estimate patient no-show probabilities and derive empirical distributions of arrival times and exam durations. Based on these inputs, we developed a discrete-event stochastic simulation model using SimPy, and integrate it with the open source Gymnasium Python library. As a baseline for policy optimization, we developed a comparative framework to evaluate on-the-fly versus reservation-based allocation strategies, in which different proportions of resources are reserved in advance. Considering a hospital configuration with a 1:6 ratio of fetal to non-fetal rooms and a 4:2 ratio of fetal to non-fetal sonographers, we show that on-the-fly allocation generally yields better performance, more effectively adapting to patient variability and resource constraints. Building on this foundation, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) to derive an approximated optimal dynamic allocation policy. This RL-based policy is benchmarked against the best-performing rule-based strategies, allowing us to quantify their differences and provide actionable insights for improving echo lab efficiency through intelligent, data-driven resource management.

<title>Pairwise Calibrated Rewards for Pluralistic Alignment</title>

Abstract: Current alignment pipelines presume a single, universal notion of desirable behavior. However, human preferences often diverge across users, contexts, and cultures. As a result, disagreement collapses into the majority signal and minority perspectives are discounted. To address this, we propose reflecting diverse human preferences through a distribution over multiple reward functions, each inducing a distinct aligned policy. The distribution is learned directly from pairwise preference without annotator identifiers or predefined groups. Instead, annotator disagreements are treated as informative soft labels. Our central criterion is pairwise calibration: for every pair of candidate responses, the proportion of reward functions preferring one response matches the fraction of annotators with that preference. We prove that even a small outlier-free ensemble can accurately represent diverse preference distributions. Empirically, we introduce and validate a practical training heuristic to learn such ensembles, and demonstrate its effectiveness through improved calibration, implying a more faithful representation of pluralistic values.

Abstract: Advances in AI portend a new era of sophisticated disinformation operations. While individual AI systems already create convincing -- and at times misleading -- information, an imminent development is the emergence of malicious AI swarms. These systems can coordinate covertly, infiltrate communities, evade traditional detectors, and run continuous A/B tests, with round-the-clock persistence. The result can include fabricated grassroots consensus, fragmented shared reality, mass harassment, voter micro-suppression or mobilization, contamination of AI training data, and erosion of institutional trust. With democratic processes worldwide increasingly vulnerable, we urge a three-pronged response: (1) platform-side defenses -- always-on swarm-detection dashboards, pre-election high-fidelity swarm-simulation stress-tests, transparency audits, and optional client-side "AI shields" for users; (2) model-side safeguards -- standardized persuasion-risk tests, provenance-authenticating passkeys, and watermarking; and (3) system-level oversight -- a UN-backed AI Influence Observatory.

<title>Reward Is Enough: LLMs Are In-Context Reinforcement Learners</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a human-designed framework for solving sequential decision making problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, surprisingly, RL emerges in LLM's (Large Language Model) inference time -- a phenomenon known as in-context RL (ICRL). Specifically, we propose a novel multi-round prompting framework called ICRL prompting. The goal is to prompt the LLM to complete a task. After the LLM generates a response at the current round, we give numerical scalar feedbacks for the response, called the rewards. At the next round, we prompt the LLM again with the same task and a context consisting of all previous responses and rewards. We observe that the quality of the LLM's response increases as the context grows. In other words, the LLM is able to maximize the scalar reward signal in the inference time, just like an RL algorithm. We evaluate ICRL prompting in three benchmarks (Game of 24, creative writing, and ScienceWorld) and demonstrate significant performance improvements over baseline methods such as Self-Refine and Reflexion. Surprisingly, in some experiments the reward signals are generated by the LLM itself, yet performance improvements are still observed from ICRL prompting, offering a promising paradigm for scaling test-time compute.

Abstract: Long document understanding has become increasingly crucial in natural language processing, with retrieval-based methods emerging as a promising solution to address the context length limitations of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches either treat documents as flat sequences or employ arbitrary chunking strategies, failing to capture the inherent discourse structure that guides human comprehension. We present DISRetrieval, a novel hierarchical retrieval framework that leverages linguistic discourse structure to enhance long document understanding. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a discourse-aware document organization framework that utilizes rhetorical structure theory (RST) to create sentence-level hierarchical representations, preserving both semantic relationships and natural document flow; (2) an LLM-enhanced node representation technique that combines discourse structure with adaptive summarization to enrich tree nodes with contextual information; and (3) a hierarchical evidence retrieval mechanism that effectively selects relevant content while maintaining discourse coherence. Through comprehensive experiments on QASPER and QuALITY datasets, DISRetrieval demonstrates substantial improvements over existing methods in both token-level retrieval metrics and downstream question answering tasks. Our ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly enhances retrieval effectiveness across different document lengths and query types, validating the importance of linguistically-informed document representation in long-text understanding. Our code and datasets are publicly available at github/DreamH1gh/DISRetrieval to facilitate future research.

<title>A Reinforcement-Learning-Enhanced LLM Framework for Automated A/B Testing in Personalized Marketing</title>

Abstract: For personalized marketing, a new challenge of how to effectively algorithm the A/B testing to maximize user response is urgently to be overcome. In this paper, we present a new approach, the RL-LLM-AB test framework, for using reinforcement learning strategy optimization combined with LLM to automate and personalize A/B tests. The RL-LLM-AB test is built upon the pre-trained instruction-tuned language model. It first generates A/B versions of candidate content variants using a Prompt-Conditioned Generator, and then dynamically embeds and fuses the user portrait and the context of the current query with the multi-modal perception module to constitute the current interaction state. The content version is then selected in real-time through the policy optimization module with an Actor-Critic structure, and long-term revenue is estimated according to real-time feedback (such as click-through rate and conversion rate). Furthermore, a Memory-Augmented Reward Estimator is embedded into the framework to capture long-term user preference drift, which helps to generalize policy across multiple users and content contexts. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed RL-LLM-ABTest over existing A/B testing methods, including classical A/B testing, Contextual Bandits, and benchmark reinforcement learning approaches on real-world marketing data.

Abstract: MEMS gyroscopes play a critical role in inertial navigation and motion control applications but typically suffer from a fundamental trade-off between measurement range and noise performance. Existing hardware-based solutions aimed at mitigating this issue introduce additional complexity, cost, and scalability challenges. Deep-learning methods primarily focus on noise reduction and typically require precisely aligned ground-truth signals, making them difficult to deploy in practical scenarios and leaving the fundamental trade-off unresolved. To address these challenges, we introduce Mixture of Experts for MEMS Gyroscopes (MoE-Gyro), a novel self-supervised framework specifically designed for simultaneous over-range signal reconstruction and noise suppression. MoE-Gyro employs two experts: an Over-Range Reconstruction Expert (ORE), featuring a Gaussian-Decay Attention mechanism for reconstructing saturated segments; and a Denoise Expert (DE), utilizing dual-branch complementary masking combined with FFT-guided augmentation for robust noise reduction. A lightweight gating module dynamically routes input segments to the appropriate expert. Furthermore, existing evaluation lack a comprehensive standard for assessing multi-dimensional signal enhancement. To bridge this gap, we introduce IMU Signal Enhancement Benchmark (ISEBench), an open-source benchmarking platform comprising the GyroPeak-100 dataset and a unified evaluation of IMU signal enhancement methods. We evaluate MoE-Gyro using our proposed ISEBench, demonstrating that our framework significantly extends the measurable range from 450 deg/s to 1500 deg/s, reduces Bias Instability by 98.4%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively addressing the long-standing trade-off in inertial sensing.

Abstract: Neural networks based on metric recognition methods have a strictly determined architecture. Number of neurons, connections, as well as weights and thresholds values are calculated analytically, based on the initial conditions of tasks: number of recognizable classes, number of samples, metric expressions used. This paper discusses the possibility of transforming these networks in order to apply classical learning algorithms to them without using analytical expressions that calculate weight values. In the received network, training is carried out by recognizing images in pairs. This approach simplifies the learning process and easily allows to expand the neural network by adding new images to the recognition task. The advantages of these networks, including such as: 1) network architecture simplicity and transparency; 2) training simplicity and reliability; 3) the possibility of using a large number of images in the recognition problem using a neural network; 4) a consistent increase in the number of recognizable classes without changing the previous values of weights and thresholds.

<title>Evolutionary model for energy trading in community microgrids using Hawk-Dove strategies</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized model of energy cooperation between microgrids, in which decisions are made locally, at the level of the microgrid community. Each microgrid is modeled as an autonomous agent that adopts a Hawk or Dove strategy, depending on the level of energy stored in the battery and its role in the energy trading process. The interactions between selling and buying microgrids are modeled through an evolutionary algorithm. An individual in the algorithm population is represented as an energy trading matrix that encodes the amounts of energy traded between the selling and buying microgrids. The population evolution is achieved by recombination and mutation operators. Recombination uses a specialized operator for matrix structures, and mutation is applied to the matrix elements according to a Gaussian distribution. The evaluation of an individual is made with a multi-criteria fitness function that considers the seller profit, the degree of energy stability at the community level, penalties for energy imbalance at the community level and for the degradation of microgrids batteries. The method was tested on a simulated scenario with 100 microgrids, each with its own selling and buying thresholds, to reflect a realistic environment with variable storage characteristics of microgrids batteries. By applying the algorithm on this scenario, 95 out of the 100 microgrids reached a stable energy state. This result confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model in achieving energy balance both at the individual level, for each microgrid, and at the level of the entire community.

Abstract: By retrieving contexts from knowledge graphs, graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) to generate quality answers for user questions. Many GraphRAG methods have been proposed and reported inspiring performance in answer quality. However, we observe that the current answer evaluation framework for GraphRAG has two critical flaws, i.e., unrelated questions and evaluation biases, which may lead to biased or even wrong conclusions on performance. To tackle the two flaws, we propose an unbiased evaluation framework that uses graph-text-grounded question generation to produce questions that are more related to the underlying dataset and an unbiased evaluation procedure to eliminate the biases in LLM-based answer assessment. We apply our unbiased framework to evaluate 3 representative GraphRAG methods and find that their performance gains are much more moderate than reported previously. Although our evaluation framework may still have flaws, it calls for scientific evaluations to lay solid foundations for GraphRAG research.

Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources, such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1) Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models (Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3) Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the LLMs era.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful architecture for combining the precision of retrieval systems with the fluency of large language models. While several studies have investigated RAG pipelines for high-resource languages, the optimization of RAG components for Arabic remains underexplored. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art RAG components-including chunking strategies, embedding models, rerankers, and language models-across a diverse set of Arabic datasets. Using the RAGAS framework, we systematically compare performance across four core metrics: context precision, context recall, answer faithfulness, and answer relevancy. Our experiments demonstrate that sentence-aware chunking outperforms all other segmentation methods, while BGE-M3 and Multilingual-E5-large emerge as the most effective embedding models. The inclusion of a reranker (bge-reranker-v2-m3) significantly boosts faithfulness in complex datasets, and Aya-8B surpasses StableLM in generation quality. These findings provide critical insights for building high-quality Arabic RAG pipelines and offer practical guidelines for selecting optimal components across different document types.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of online education platforms, an increasing number of students are gaining new knowledge through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Exercise recommendation have made strides toward improving student learning outcomes. However, existing methods not only struggle with high dropout rates but also fail to match the diverse learning pace of students. They frequently face difficulties in adjusting to inactive students' learning patterns and in accommodating individualized learning paces, resulting in limited accuracy and diversity in recommendations. To tackle these challenges, we propose Neural Re-ranking for Diversified Exercise Recommendation (in short, NR4DER). NR4DER first leverages the mLSTM model to improve the effectiveness of the exercise filter module. It then employs a sequence enhancement method to enhance the representation of inactive students, accurately matches students with exercises of appropriate difficulty. Finally, it utilizes neural re-ranking to generate diverse recommendation lists based on individual students' learning histories. Extensive experimental results indicate that NR4DER significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple real-world datasets and effectively caters to the diverse learning pace of students.

Abstract: Recent advances in speech-enabled language models have shown promising results in building intelligent voice assistants. However, most existing approaches rely on large-scale paired speech-text data and extensive computational resources, which pose challenges in terms of scalability and accessibility. In this paper, we present \textbf{TESU-LLM}, a novel framework that enables training speech-capable language models using only text data. Our key insight is to leverage a unified encoder that maps semantically equivalent text and speech inputs to a shared latent space. By aligning the encoder output with the embedding space of a LLM via a lightweight projection network, we enable the model to generalize from text-only supervision to speech-based inference. Despite being trained exclusively on text, TESU-LLM achieves strong performance on various speech-related benchmarks, comparable to baseline methods trained with large-scale multimodal datasets and substantial computational resources. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, offering a scalable path toward building speech LLMs without speech data.

Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are composed of physical elements that can dynamically alter electromagnetic wave properties to enhance beamforming and leading to improvements in areas with low coverage properties. They have the potential to be combined with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to achieve network performance and energy efficiency via optimization techniques. In addition to performance and energy improvements, it is also crucial to consider the concept of fair communications. RISs must ensure that User Equipment (UE) units receive their signals with adequate strength, without other UE being deprived of service due to insufficient power. In this paper, we address such a problem. We explore the fairness properties of previous work and propose a novel method that aims at obtaining an efficient and fair duplex RIS-RL system for multiple legitimate UE units. We report and discuss our experimental work and simulation results. We also release our code and datasets to foster further research in the topic.

In this context, this study proposes a novel approach that combines transformer-based time series models with explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to enhance the interpretability and accuracy of stock price predictions. The analysis focuses on the daily stock prices of the five highest-volume banks listed in the BIST100 index, along with XBANK and XU100 indices, covering the period from January 2015 to March 2025. Models including DLinear, LTSNet, Vanilla Transformer, and Time Series Transformer are employed, with input features enriched by technical indicators. SHAP and LIME techniques are used to provide transparency into the influence of individual features on model outputs. The results demonstrate the strong predictive capabilities of transformer models and highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning to empower individuals in making informed investment decisions and actively engaging in financial markets.

Abstract: Toxicity detection in gaming communities faces significant scaling challenges when expanding across multiple games and languages, particularly in real-time environments where computational efficiency is crucial. We present two key findings to address these challenges while building upon our previous work on ToxBuster, a BERT-based real-time toxicity detection system. First, we introduce a soft-prompting approach that enables a single model to effectively handle multiple games by incorporating game-context tokens, matching the performance of more complex methods like curriculum learning while offering superior scalability. Second, we develop an LLM-assisted label transfer framework using GPT-4o-mini to extend support to seven additional languages. Evaluations on real game chat data across French, German, Portuguese, and Russian achieve macro F1-scores ranging from 32.96% to 58.88%, with particularly strong performance in German, surpassing the English benchmark of 45.39%. In production, this unified approach significantly reduces computational resources and maintenance overhead compared to maintaining separate models for each game and language combination. At Ubisoft, this model successfully identifies an average of 50 players, per game, per day engaging in sanctionable behavior.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission losses (TLs) is essential to assess the performance of the global International Monitoring System infrasound network. Among existing propagation modeling tools, parabolic equation (PE) method enables TLs to be finely modeled, but its computational cost does not allow exploration of a large parameter space for operational monitoring applications. To reduce computation times, Brissaud et al. 2023 explored the potential of convolutional neural networks trained on a large set of regionally simulated wavefields (< 1000 km from the source) to predict TLs with negligible computation times compared to PE simulations. However, this method struggles in unfavorable initial wind conditions, especially at high frequencies, and causal issues with winds at large distances from the source affecting ground TLs close to the source. In this study, we have developed an optimized convolutional network designed to minimize prediction errors while predicting TLs from globally simulated combined temperature and wind fields spanning over propagation ranges of 4000 km. Our approach enhances the previously proposed one by implementing key optimizations that improve the overall architecture performance. The implemented model predicts TLs with an average error of 8.6 dB in the whole frequency band (0.1-3.2 Hz) and explored realistic atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: The growing convergence between Large Language Models (LLMs) and electroencephalography (EEG) research is enabling new directions in neural decoding, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), and affective computing. This survey offers a systematic review and structured taxonomy of recent advancements that utilize LLMs for EEG-based analysis and applications. We organize the literature into four domains: (1) LLM-inspired foundation models for EEG representation learning, (2) EEG-to-language decoding, (3) cross-modal generation including image and 3D object synthesis, and (4) clinical applications and dataset management tools. The survey highlights how transformer-based architectures adapted through fine-tuning, few-shot, and zero-shot learning have enabled EEG-based models to perform complex tasks such as natural language generation, semantic interpretation, and diagnostic assistance. By offering a structured overview of modeling strategies, system designs, and application areas, this work serves as a foundational resource for future work to bridge natural language processing and neural signal analysis through language models.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is essential for evaluating the performance of the International Monitoring System, enabling the effective design and maintenance of infrasound stations to support compliance of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. State-of-the-art propagation modeling tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models. However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long range propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km altitude and 4,000 km distance. We also optimize several aspects of the neural network architecture. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture spatially and range-dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and provides epistemic and data-related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on the 2022 Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included in the training. This represents a significant step towards near real-time assessment of International Monitoring System detection thresholds of explosive sources.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has long promised to improve energy management in smart grids by enhancing situational awareness and supporting more effective decision-making. While traditional machine learning has demonstrated notable results in forecasting and optimization, it often struggles with generalization, situational awareness, and heterogeneous data integration. Recent advances in foundation models such as Transformer architecture and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated improved capabilities in modelling complex temporal and contextual relationships, as well as in multi-modal data fusion which is essential for most AI applications in the energy sector. In this review we synthesize the rapid expanding field of AI applications in the energy domain focusing on Transformers and LLMs. We examine the architectural foundations, domain-specific adaptations and practical implementations of transformer models across various forecasting and grid management tasks. We then explore the emerging role of LLMs in the field: adaptation and fine tuning for the energy sector, the type of tasks they are suited for, and the new challenges they introduce. Along the way, we highlight practical implementations, innovations, and areas where the research frontier is rapidly expanding. These recent developments reviewed underscore a broader trend: Generative AI (GenAI) is beginning to augment decision-making not only in high-level planning but also in day-to-day operations, from forecasting and grid balancing to workforce training and asset onboarding. Building on these developments, we introduce the concept of the Agentic Digital Twin, a next-generation model that integrates LLMs to bring autonomy, proactivity, and social interaction into digital twin-based energy management systems.

<title>Tactile MNIST: Benchmarking Active Tactile Perception</title>

Abstract: Tactile perception has the potential to significantly enhance dexterous robotic manipulation by providing rich local information that can complement or substitute for other sensory modalities such as vision. However, because tactile sensing is inherently local, it is not well-suited for tasks that require broad spatial awareness or global scene understanding on its own. A human-inspired strategy to address this issue is to consider active perception techniques instead. That is, to actively guide sensors toward regions with more informative or significant features and integrate such information over time in order to understand a scene or complete a task. Both active perception and different methods for tactile sensing have received significant attention recently. Yet, despite advancements, both fields lack standardized benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Tactile MNIST Benchmark Suite, an open-source, Gymnasium-compatible benchmark specifically designed for active tactile perception tasks, including localization, classification, and volume estimation. Our benchmark suite offers diverse simulation scenarios, from simple toy environments all the way to complex tactile perception tasks using vision-based tactile sensors. Furthermore, we also offer a comprehensive dataset comprising 13,500 synthetic 3D MNIST digit models and 153,600 real-world tactile samples collected from 600 3D printed digits. Using this dataset, we train a CycleGAN for realistic tactile simulation rendering. By providing standardized protocols and reproducible evaluation frameworks, our benchmark suite facilitates systematic progress in the fields of tactile sensing and active perception.

<title>CR-BLEA: Contrastive Ranking for Adaptive Resource Allocation in Bilevel Evolutionary Algorithms</title>

Abstract: Bilevel optimization poses a significant computational challenge due to its nested structure, where each upper-level candidate solution requires solving a corresponding lower-level problem. While evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are effective at navigating such complex landscapes, their high resource demands remain a key bottleneck -- particularly the redundant evaluation of numerous unpromising lower-level tasks. Despite recent advances in multitasking and transfer learning, resource waste persists. To address this issue, we propose a novel resource allocation framework for bilevel EAs that selectively identifies and focuses on promising lower-level tasks. Central to our approach is a contrastive ranking network that learns relational patterns between paired upper- and lower-level solutions online. This knowledge guides a reference-based ranking strategy that prioritizes tasks for optimization and adaptively controls resampling based on estimated population quality. Comprehensive experiments across five state-of-the-art bilevel algorithms show that our framework significantly reduces computational cost while preserving -- or even enhancing -- solution accuracy. This work offers a generalizable strategy to improve the efficiency of bilevel EAs, paving the way for more scalable bilevel optimization.

<title>Enhancing Decision-Making of Large Language Models via Actor-Critic</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in natural language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with high-level objectives. Existing methods either rely on short-term auto-regressive action generation or face limitations in accurately simulating rollouts and assessing outcomes, leading to sub-optimal decisions. This paper introduces a novel LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, that effectively improves LLM policies with long-term action evaluations in a principled and scalable way. Our approach addresses two key challenges: (1) extracting robust action evaluations by computing Q-values via token logits associated with positive/negative outcomes, enhanced by future trajectory rollouts and reasoning; and (2) enabling efficient policy improvement through a gradient-free mechanism. Experiments across diverse environments -- including high-level decision-making (ALFWorld), low-level action spaces (BabyAI-Text), and large action spaces (WebShop) -- demonstrate the framework's generality and superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach achieves competitive performance using 7B/8B parameter LLMs, even outperforming baseline methods employing GPT-4 in complex tasks. These results underscore the potential of integrating structured policy optimization with LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to advance decision-making capabilities in multi-step environments.

Abstract: Extreme events, such as market crashes, natural disasters, and pandemics, are rare but catastrophic, often triggering cascading failures across interconnected systems. Accurate prediction and early warning can help minimize losses and improve preparedness. While data-driven methods offer powerful capabilities for extreme event modeling, they require abundant training data, yet extreme event data is inherently scarce, creating a fundamental challenge. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful solution. However, existing surveys focus on general data with privacy preservation emphasis, rather than extreme events' unique performance requirements. This survey provides the first overview of synthetic data generation for extreme events. We systematically review generative modeling techniques and large language models, particularly those enhanced by statistical theory as well as specialized training and sampling mechanisms to capture heavy-tailed distributions. We summarize benchmark datasets and introduce a tailored evaluation framework covering statistical, dependence, visual, and task-oriented metrics. A central contribution is our in-depth analysis of each metric's applicability in extremeness and domain-specific adaptations, providing actionable guidance for model evaluation in extreme settings. We categorize key application domains and identify underexplored areas like behavioral finance, wildfires, earthquakes, windstorms, and infectious outbreaks. Finally, we outline open challenges, providing a structured foundation for advancing synthetic rare-event research.

Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce CPS-Guard, a novel framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g., safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning) to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, CPS-Guard continuously evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our results show that CPS-Guard effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&amp;V in safety- and security-critical systems.

Abstract: This paper explains \textbf{why it is impossible to create large language models that do not hallucinate and what are the trade-offs we should be looking for}. It presents a formal \textbf{impossibility theorem} demonstrating that no inference mechanism can simultaneously satisfy four fundamental properties: \textbf{truthful (non-hallucinatory) generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality}. By modeling LLM inference as an \textbf{auction of ideas} where neural components compete to contribute to responses, we prove the impossibility using the Green-Laffont theorem. That mathematical framework provides a rigorous foundation for understanding the nature of inference process, with implications for model architecture, training objectives, and evaluation methods.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt injection attacks have emerged as a significant security threat. Existing defense mechanisms often face critical trade-offs between effectiveness and generalizability. This highlights the urgent need for efficient prompt injection detection methods that are applicable across a wide range of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose DMPI-PMHFE, a dual-channel feature fusion detection framework. It integrates a pretrained language model with heuristic feature engineering to detect prompt injection attacks. Specifically, the framework employs DeBERTa-v3-base as a feature extractor to transform input text into semantic vectors enriched with contextual information. In parallel, we design heuristic rules based on known attack patterns to extract explicit structural features commonly observed in attacks. Features from both channels are subsequently fused and passed through a fully connected neural network to produce the final prediction. This dual-channel approach mitigates the limitations of relying only on DeBERTa to extract features. Experimental results on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate that DMPI-PMHFE outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, when deployed actually, it significantly reduces attack success rates across mainstream LLMs, including GLM-4, LLaMA 3, Qwen 2.5, and GPT-4o.

Abstract: The increasing deployment of large antenna arrays at base stations has significantly improved the spatial resolution and localization accuracy of radio-localization methods. However, traditional signal processing techniques struggle in complex radio environments, particularly in scenarios dominated by non line of sight (NLoS) propagation paths, resulting in degraded localization accuracy. Recent developments in machine learning have facilitated the development of machine learning-assisted localization techniques, enhancing localization accuracy in complex radio environments. However, these methods often involve substantial computational complexity during both the training and inference phases. This work extends the well-established fingerprinting-based localization framework by simultaneously reducing its memory requirements and improving its accuracy. Specifically, a model-based neural network is used to learn the location-to-channel mapping, and then serves as a generative neural channel model. This generative model augments the fingerprinting comparison dictionary while reducing the memory requirements. The proposed method outperforms fingerprinting baselines by achieving sub-wavelength localization accuracy, even in NLoS environments. Remarkably, it offers an improvement by several orders of magnitude in localization accuracy, while simultaneously reducing memory requirements by an order of magnitude compared to classical fingerprinting methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize various fields, including code development, robotics, finance, and education, due to their extensive prior knowledge and rapid advancements. This paper investigates how LLMs can be leveraged in engineering education. Specifically, we benchmark the capabilities of different LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o, and Llama 3 70B, in assessing homework for an undergraduate-level circuit analysis course. We have developed a novel dataset consisting of official reference solutions and real student solutions to problems from various topics in circuit analysis. To overcome the limitations of image recognition in current state-of-the-art LLMs, the solutions in the dataset are converted to LaTeX format. Using this dataset, a prompt template is designed to test five metrics of student solutions: completeness, method, final answer, arithmetic error, and units. The results show that GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B perform significantly better than GPT-3.5 Turbo across all five metrics, with GPT-4o and Llama 3 70B each having distinct advantages in different evaluation aspects. Additionally, we present insights into the limitations of current LLMs in several aspects of circuit analysis. Given the paramount importance of ensuring reliability in LLM-generated homework assessment to avoid misleading students, our results establish benchmarks and offer valuable insights for the development of a reliable, personalized tutor for circuit analysis -- a focus of our future work. Furthermore, the proposed evaluation methods can be generalized to a broader range of courses for engineering education in the future.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across sectors, yet their alignment with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) is not well understood. This study evaluates eight leading LLMs on their ability to refuse prompts that explicitly violate these legal frameworks, focusing also on helpfulness - how clearly and constructively refusals are communicated. While most models rejected unlawful requests, the clarity and consistency of their responses varied. By revealing the model's rationale and referencing relevant legal or safety principles, explanatory refusals clarify the system's boundaries, reduce ambiguity, and help prevent misuse. A standardised system-level safety prompt significantly improved the quality of the explanations expressed within refusals in most models, highlighting the effectiveness of lightweight interventions. However, more complex prompts involving technical language or requests for code revealed ongoing vulnerabilities. These findings contribute to the development of safer, more transparent AI systems and propose a benchmark to evaluate the compliance of LLM with IHL.

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in the battlefield, Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), gives rise to new opportunities for enhancing situational awareness. To increase the potential of IoBT for situational awareness in critical decision making, the data from these devices must be processed into consumer-ready information objects, and made available to consumers on demand. To address this challenge we propose a workflow that makes use of natural language processing (NLP) to query a database technology and return a response in natural language. Our solution utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) that are sized for edge devices to perform NLP as well as graphical databases which are well suited for dynamic connected networks which are pervasive in the IoBT. Our architecture employs LLMs for both mapping questions in natural language to Cypher database queries as well as to summarize the database output back to the user in natural language. We evaluate several medium sized LLMs for both of these tasks on a database representing publicly available data from the US Army's Multipurpose Sensing Area (MSA) at the Jornada Range in Las Cruces, NM. We observe that Llama 3.1 (8 billion parameters) outperforms the other models across all the considered metrics. Most importantly, we note that, unlike current methods, our two step approach allows the relaxation of the Exact Match (EM) requirement of the produced Cypher queries with ground truth code and, in this way, it achieves a 19.4% increase in accuracy. Our workflow lays the ground work for deploying LLMs on edge devices to enable natural language interactions with databases containing information objects for critical decision making.

Abstract: Positional encodings are a core part of transformer-based models, enabling processing of sequential data without recurrence. This paper presents a theoretical framework to analyze how various positional encoding methods, including sinusoidal, learned, relative, and bias-based methods like Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), impact a transformer's expressiveness, generalization ability, and extrapolation to longer sequences. Expressiveness is defined via function approximation, generalization bounds are established using Rademacher complexity, and new encoding methods based on orthogonal functions, such as wavelets and Legendre polynomials, are proposed. The extrapolation capacity of existing and proposed encodings is analyzed, extending ALiBi's biasing approach to a unified theoretical context. Experimental evaluation on synthetic sequence-to-sequence tasks shows that orthogonal transform-based encodings outperform traditional sinusoidal encodings in generalization and extrapolation. This work addresses a critical gap in transformer theory, providing insights for design choices in natural language processing, computer vision, and other transformer applications.

Abstract: Lightweight Large Language Models (LwLLMs) are reduced-parameter, optimized models designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware, offering significant advantages in resource efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and data privacy. However, these models often struggle with limited inference and reasoning capabilities, which restrict their performance on complex tasks and limit their practical applicability. Moreover, existing prompt optimization methods typically rely on extensive manual effort or the meta-cognitive abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, making them less effective for LwLLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce DeBoP, a new Direct Behavior Optimization Paradigm, original from the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique. Unlike CoT Prompting, DeBoP is an automatic optimization method, which focuses on the optimization directly on the behavior of LwLLMs. In particular, DeBoP transforms the optimization of complex prompts into the optimization of discrete, quantifiable execution sequences using a gradient-free Monte Carlo Tree Search. We evaluate DeBoP on seven challenging tasks where state-of-the-art LLMs excel but LwLLMs generally underperform. Experimental results demonstrate that DeBoP significantly outperforms recent prompt optimization methods on most tasks. In particular, DeBoP-optimized LwLLMs surpass GPT-3.5 on most tasks while reducing computational time by approximately 60% compared to other automatic prompt optimization methods.

Abstract: The application scope of Large Language Models (LLMs) continues to expand, leading to increasing interest in personalized LLMs that align with human values. However, aligning these models with individual values raises significant safety concerns, as certain values may correlate with harmful information. In this paper, we identify specific safety risks associated with value-aligned LLMs and investigate the psychological principles behind these challenges. Our findings reveal two key insights. (1) Value-aligned LLMs are more prone to harmful behavior compared to non-fine-tuned models and exhibit slightly higher risks in traditional safety evaluations than other fine-tuned models. (2) These safety issues arise because value-aligned LLMs genuinely generate text according to the aligned values, which can amplify harmful outcomes. Using a dataset with detailed safety categories, we find significant correlations between value alignment and safety risks, supported by psychological hypotheses. This study offers insights into the "black box" of value alignment and proposes in-context alignment methods to enhance the safety of value-aligned LLMs.

<title>SMAR: Soft Modality-Aware Routing Strategy for MoE-based Multimodal Large Language Models Preserving Language Capabilities</title>

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have become a key approach for scaling large language models, with growing interest in extending them to multimodal tasks. Existing methods to build multimodal MoE models either incur high training costs or suffer from degraded language capabilities when adapting pretrained models. To address this, we propose Soft ModalityAware Routing (SMAR), a novel regularization technique that uses Kullback Leibler divergence to control routing probability distributions across modalities, encouraging expert specialization without modifying model architecture or heavily relying on textual data. Experiments on visual instruction tuning show that SMAR preserves language ability at 86.6% retention with only 2.5% pure text, outperforming baselines while maintaining strong multimodal performance. Our approach offers a practical and efficient solution to balance modality differentiation and language capabilities in multimodal MoE models.

Abstract: Synthetic time series generated by diffusion models enable sharing privacy-sensitive datasets, such as patients' functional MRI records. Key criteria for synthetic data include high data utility and traceability to verify the data source. Recent watermarking methods embed in homogeneous latent spaces, but state-of-the-art time series generators operate in real space, making latent-based watermarking incompatible. This creates the challenge of watermarking directly in real space while handling feature heterogeneity and temporal dependencies. We propose TimeWak, the first watermarking algorithm for multivariate time series diffusion models. To handle temporal dependence and spatial heterogeneity, TimeWak embeds a temporal chained-hashing watermark directly within the real temporal-feature space. The other unique feature is the $\epsilon$-exact inversion, which addresses the non-uniform reconstruction error distribution across features from inverting the diffusion process to detect watermarks. We derive the error bound of inverting multivariate time series and further maintain high watermark detectability. We extensively evaluate TimeWak on its impact on synthetic data quality, watermark detectability, and robustness under various post-editing attacks, against 5 datasets and baselines of different temporal lengths. Our results show that TimeWak achieves improvements of 61.96% in context-FID score, and 8.44% in correlational scores against the state-of-the-art baseline, while remaining consistently detectable.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) watermarks enable authentication of text provenance, curb misuse of machine-generated text, and promote trust in AI systems. Current watermarks operate by changing the next-token predictions output by an LLM. The updated (i.e., watermarked) predictions depend on random side information produced, for example, by hashing previously generated tokens. LLM watermarking is particularly challenging in low-entropy generation tasks - such as coding - where next-token predictions are near-deterministic. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for watermark design. Our goal is to understand how to most effectively use random side information in order to maximize the likelihood of watermark detection and minimize the distortion of generated text. Our analysis informs the design of two new watermarks: HeavyWater and SimplexWater. Both watermarks are tunable, gracefully trading-off between detection accuracy and text distortion. They can also be applied to any LLM and are agnostic to side information generation. We examine the performance of HeavyWater and SimplexWater through several benchmarks, demonstrating that they can achieve high watermark detection accuracy with minimal compromise of text generation quality, particularly in the low-entropy regime. Our theoretical analysis also reveals surprising new connections between LLM watermarking and coding theory. The code implementation can be found in https://github.com/DorTsur/HeavyWater_SimplexWater

Abstract: Existing language model safety evaluations focus on overt attacks and low-stakes tasks. Realistic attackers can subvert current safeguards by requesting help on small, benign-seeming tasks across many independent queries. Because individual queries do not appear harmful, the attack is hard to {detect}. However, when combined, these fragments uplift misuse by helping the attacker complete hard and dangerous tasks. Toward identifying defenses against such strategies, we develop Benchmarks for Stateful Defenses (BSD), a data generation pipeline that automates evaluations of covert attacks and corresponding defenses. Using this pipeline, we curate two new datasets that are consistently refused by frontier models and are too difficult for weaker open-weight models. Our evaluations indicate that decomposition attacks are effective misuse enablers, and highlight stateful defenses as a countermeasure.

Abstract: Pretrained molecular encoders have become indispensable in computational chemistry for tasks such as property prediction and molecular generation. However, the standard practice of relying solely on final-layer embeddings for downstream tasks may discard valuable information. In this work, we challenge this convention by conducting a comprehensive layer-wise analysis of five diverse molecular encoders across 22 ADMET property prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that embeddings from intermediate layers consistently outperform final-layer representations. Specifically, using fixed embeddings from the optimal intermediate layers improved downstream performance by an average of 5.4%, reaching gains up to 28.6%. Furthermore, finetuning up to these intermediate layers yielded even greater average improvements of 8.5%, with performance increases as high as 40.8%, achieving new state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks. Additionally, a strong positive correlation between fixed embedding performance and finetuning outcomes supports an efficient evaluate-then-finetune approach, enabling identification of optimal layers with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of exploring the full representational depth of molecular encoders to achieve substantial performance improvements and computational efficiency.

<title>Saffron-1: Towards an Inference Scaling Paradigm for LLM Safety Assurance</title>

Abstract: Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have exposed these methods' susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks. Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance. Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM) evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model (Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M) to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project homepage is at https://q-rz.github.io/p/saffron .

Abstract: State of the art large language models are trained using large amounts of tokens derived from raw text using what is called a tokenizer. Crucially, the tokenizer determines the (token) vocabulary a model will use during inference as well as, in principle, the (token) language. This is because, while the token vocabulary may allow for different tokenizations of a string, the tokenizer always maps the string to only one of these tokenizations--the canonical tokenization. However, multiple lines of empirical evidence suggest that large language models do not always generate canonical token sequences, and this comes with several negative consequences. In this work, we first show that, to generate a canonical token sequence, a model needs to generate (partial) canonical token sequences at each step of the autoregressive generation process underpinning its functioning. Building upon this theoretical result, we introduce canonical sampling, a simple and efficient sampling method that precludes a given model from generating non-canonical token sequences. Further, we also show that, in comparison with standard sampling, the distribution of token sequences generated using canonical sampling is provably closer to the true distribution of token sequences used during training.

Abstract: While predictive accuracy is often prioritized in machine learning (ML) models, interpretability remains essential in scientific and high-stakes domains. However, diverse interpretability algorithms frequently yield conflicting explanations, highlighting the need for consensus to harmonize results. In this study, six ML models were trained on six synthetic datasets with known ground truths, utilizing various model-agnostic interpretability techniques. Consensus explanations were generated using established methods and a novel approach: WISCA (Weighted Scaled Consensus Attributions), which integrates class probability and normalized attributions. WISCA consistently aligned with the most reliable individual method, underscoring the value of robust consensus strategies in improving explanation reliability.

<title>Cost-Efficient LLM Training with Lifetime-Aware Tensor Offloading via GPUDirect Storage</title>

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of a new lifetime-aware tensor offloading framework for GPU memory expansion using low-cost PCIe-based solid-state drives (SSDs). Our framework, TERAIO, is developed explicitly for large language model (LLM) training with multiple GPUs and multiple SSDs. Its design is driven by our observation that the active tensors take only a small fraction (1.7% on average) of allocated GPU memory in each LLM training iteration, the inactive tensors are usually large and will not be used for a long period of time, creating ample opportunities for offloading/prefetching tensors to/from slow SSDs without stalling the GPU training process. TERAIO accurately estimates the lifetime (active period of time in GPU memory) of each tensor with the profiling of the first few iterations in the training process. With the tensor lifetime analysis, TERAIO will generate an optimized tensor offloading/prefetching plan and integrate it into the compiled LLM program via PyTorch. TERAIO has a runtime tensor migration engine to execute the offloading/prefetching plan via GPUDirect storage, which allows direct tensor migration between GPUs and SSDs for alleviating the CPU bottleneck and maximizing the SSD bandwidth utilization. In comparison with state-of-the-art studies such as ZeRO-Offload and ZeRO-Infinity, we show that TERAIO improves the training performance of various LLMs by 1.47x on average, and achieves 80.7% of the ideal performance assuming unlimited GPU memory.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable object detection is critical for ensuring the safety and efficiency of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs). Traditional on-board perception systems have limited accuracy due to occlusions and blind spots, while cloud-based solutions introduce significant latency, making them unsuitable for real-time processing demands required for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce an innovative framework, Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection (ECOD) for CAVs, that leverages edge computing and multi-CAV collaboration for real-time, multi-perspective object detection. Our ECOD framework integrates two key algorithms: Perceptive Aggregation and Collaborative Estimation (PACE) and Variable Object Tally and Evaluation (VOTE). PACE aggregates detection data from multiple CAVs on an edge server to enhance perception in scenarios where individual CAVs have limited visibility. VOTE utilizes a consensus-based voting mechanism to improve the accuracy of object classification by integrating data from multiple CAVs. Both algorithms are designed at the edge to operate in real-time, ensuring low-latency and reliable decision-making for CAVs. We develop a hardware-based controlled testbed consisting of camera-equipped robotic CAVs and an edge server to evaluate the efficacy of our framework. Our experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of ECOD in terms of improved object classification accuracy, outperforming traditional single-perspective onboard approaches by up to 75%, while ensuring low-latency, edge-driven real-time processing. This research highlights the potential of edge computing to enhance collaborative perception for latency-sensitive autonomous systems.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion enables subject-driven image synthesis by adapting the model to generate images containing specific subjects. However, existing fine-tuning methods suffer from two key issues: underfitting, where the model fails to reliably capture subject identity, and overfitting, where it memorizes the subject image and reduces background diversity. To address these challenges, we propose two auxiliary consistency losses for diffusion fine-tuning. First, a prior consistency regularization loss ensures that the predicted diffusion noise for prior (non-subject) images remains consistent with that of the pretrained model, improving fidelity. Second, a subject consistency regularization loss enhances the fine-tuned model's robustness to multiplicative noise modulated latent code, helping to preserve subject identity while improving diversity. Our experimental results demonstrate that incorporating these losses into fine-tuning not only preserves subject identity but also enhances image diversity, outperforming DreamBooth in terms of CLIP scores, background variation, and overall visual quality.

<title>The Economic Dispatch of Power-to-Gas Systems with Deep Reinforcement Learning:Tackling the Challenge of Delayed Rewards with Long-Term Energy Storage</title>

Abstract: Power-to-Gas (P2G) technologies gain recognition for enabling the integration of intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, into electricity grids. However, determining the most cost-effective operation of these systems is complex due to the volatile nature of renewable energy, electricity prices, and loads. Additionally, P2G systems are less efficient in converting and storing energy compared to battery energy storage systems (BESs), and the benefits of converting electricity into gas are not immediately apparent. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown promise in managing the operation of energy systems amidst these uncertainties. Yet, DRL techniques face difficulties with the delayed reward characteristic of P2G system operation. Previous research has mostly focused on short-term studies that look at the energy conversion process, neglecting the long-term storage capabilities of P2G.
  This study presents a new method by thoroughly examining how DRL can be applied to the economic operation of P2G systems, in combination with BESs and gas turbines, over extended periods. Through three progressively more complex case studies, we assess the performance of DRL algorithms, specifically Deep Q-Networks and Proximal Policy Optimization, and introduce modifications to enhance their effectiveness. These modifications include integrating forecasts, implementing penalties on the reward function, and applying strategic cost calculations, all aimed at addressing the issue of delayed rewards. Our findings indicate that while DRL initially struggles with the complex decision-making required for P2G system operation, the adjustments we propose significantly improve its capability to devise cost-effective operation strategies, thereby unlocking the potential for long-term energy storage in P2G technologies.

Abstract: Large language models frequently rely on both contextual input and parametric knowledge to perform tasks. However, these sources can come into conflict, especially when retrieved documents contradict the model's parametric knowledge. We propose a diagnostic framework to systematically evaluate LLM behavior under context-memory conflict, where the contextual information diverges from their parametric beliefs. We construct diagnostic data that elicit these conflicts and analyze model performance across multiple task types. Our findings reveal that (1) knowledge conflict has minimal impact on tasks that do not require knowledge utilization, (2) model performance is consistently higher when contextual and parametric knowledge are aligned, (3) models are unable to fully suppress their internal knowledge even when instructed, and (4) providing rationales that explain the conflict increases reliance on contexts. These insights raise concerns about the validity of model-based evaluation and underscore the need to account for knowledge conflict in the deployment of LLMs.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) driven synthetic data generation has emerged as a powerful method for improving model reasoning capabilities. However, most methods either distill large state-of-the-art models into small students or use natural ground-truth problem statements to guarantee problem statement quality. This limits the scalability of these approaches to more complex and diverse problem domains. To address this, we present SPARQ: Synthetic Problem Generation for Reasoning via Quality-Diversity Algorithms, a novel approach for generating high-quality and diverse synthetic math problem and solution pairs using only a single model by measuring a problem's solve-rate: a proxy for problem difficulty. Starting from a seed dataset of 7.5K samples, we generate over 20 million new problem-solution pairs. We show that filtering the generated data by difficulty and then fine-tuning the same model on the resulting data improves relative model performance by up to 24\%. Additionally, we conduct ablations studying the impact of synthetic data quantity, quality and diversity on model generalization. We find that higher quality, as measured by problem difficulty, facilitates better in-distribution performance. Further, while generating diverse synthetic data does not as strongly benefit in-distribution performance, filtering for more diverse data facilitates more robust OOD generalization. We also confirm the existence of model and data scaling laws for synthetically generated problems, which positively benefit downstream model generalization.

Abstract: In this contribution, we examine the capability of private GPTs to automatically generate executable test code based on requirements. More specifically, we use acceptance criteria as input, formulated as part of epics, or stories, which are typically used in modern development processes. This gives product owners, or business intelligence, respectively, a way to directly produce testable criteria through the use of LLMs. We explore the quality of the so-produced tests in two ways: i) directly by letting the LLM generate code from requirements, ii) through an intermediate step using Gherkin syntax. As a result, it turns out that the two-step procedure yields better results -where we define better in terms of human readability and best coding practices, i.e. lines of code and use of additional libraries typically used in testing. Concretely, we evaluate prompt effectiveness across two scenarios: a simple "Hello World" program and a digit classification model, showing that structured prompts lead to higher-quality test outputs.

Abstract: Recent work on large language models (LLMs) has increasingly focused on post-training and alignment with datasets curated to enhance instruction following, world knowledge, and specialized skills. However, most post-training datasets used in leading open- and closed-source LLMs remain inaccessible to the public, with limited information about their construction process. This lack of transparency has motivated the recent development of open-source post-training corpora. While training on these open alternatives can yield performance comparable to that of leading models, systematic comparisons remain challenging due to the significant computational cost of conducting them rigorously at scale, and are therefore largely absent. As a result, it remains unclear how specific samples, task types, or curation strategies influence downstream performance when assessing data quality. In this work, we conduct the first comprehensive side-by-side analysis of two prominent open post-training datasets: Tulu-3-SFT-Mix and SmolTalk. Using the Magpie framework, we annotate each sample with detailed quality metrics, including turn structure (single-turn vs. multi-turn), task category, input quality, and response quality, and we derive statistics that reveal structural and qualitative similarities and differences between the two datasets. Based on these insights, we design a principled curation recipe that produces a new data mixture, TuluTalk, which contains 14% fewer samples than either source dataset while matching or exceeding their performance on key benchmarks. Our findings offer actionable insights for constructing more effective post-training datasets that improve model performance within practical resource limits. To support future research, we publicly release both the annotated source datasets and our curated TuluTalk mixture.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely adopted in various real-world applications. However, the control and optimization of multi-UAV systems remain a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and constrained environments. This work explores the joint motion and communication control of multiple UAVs operating within integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks that include high-altitude platform stations (HAPS). Specifically, we consider an aerial highway scenario in which UAVs must accelerate, decelerate, and change lanes to avoid collisions and maintain overall traffic flow. Different from existing studies, we propose a novel hierarchical and collaborative method based on large language models (LLMs). In our approach, an LLM deployed on the HAPS performs UAV access control, while another LLM onboard each UAV handles motion planning and control. This LLM-based framework leverages the rich knowledge embedded in pre-trained models to enable both high-level strategic planning and low-level tactical decisions. This knowledge-driven paradigm holds great potential for the development of next-generation 3D aerial highway systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed collaborative LLM-based method achieves higher system rewards, lower operational costs, and significantly reduced UAV collision rates compared to baseline approaches.

Abstract: When exposed to complex queries containing multiple conditions, today's large language models (LLMs) tend to produce responses that only partially satisfy the query while neglecting certain conditions. We therefore introduce the concept of Intent Hallucination. In this phenomenon, LLMs either omit (neglecting to address certain parts) or misinterpret (responding to invented query parts) elements of the given query, leading to intent hallucinated generation. To systematically evaluate intent hallucination, we introduce FAITHQA, a novel benchmark for intent hallucination that contains 20,068 problems, covering both query-only and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups with varying topics and difficulty. FAITHQA is the first hallucination benchmark that goes beyond factual verification, tailored to identify the fundamental cause of intent hallucination. By evaluating various LLMs on FAITHQA, we find that (1) intent hallucination is a common issue even for state-of-the-art models, and (2) the phenomenon stems from omission or misinterpretation of LLMs. To facilitate future research, we introduce an automatic LLM generation evaluation metric, CONSTRAINT SCORE, for detecting intent hallucination. Human evaluation results demonstrate that CONSTRAINT SCORE is closer to human performance for intent hallucination compared to baselines.

Abstract: After a disruptive event or shock, such as the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) federal layoffs of 2025, expert judgments are colored by knowledge of the outcome. This can make it difficult or impossible to reconstruct the pre-event perceptions needed to study the factors associated with the event. This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs), trained on vast amounts of digital media data, can be a viable substitute for expert political surveys when a shock disrupts traditional measurement. We analyze the DOGE layoffs as a specific case study for this position. We use pairwise comparison prompts with LLMs and derive ideology scores for federal executive agencies. These scores replicate pre-layoff expert measures and predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE. We also use this same approach and find that the perceptions of certain federal agencies as knowledge institutions predict which agencies were targeted by DOGE, even when controlling for ideology. This case study demonstrates that using LLMs allows us to rapidly and easily test the associated factors hypothesized behind the shock. More broadly, our case study of this recent event exemplifies how LLMs offer insights into the correlational factors of the shock when traditional measurement techniques fail. We conclude by proposing a two-part criterion for when researchers can turn to LLMs as a substitute for expert political surveys.

Abstract: Constructing real-world data-to-insight pipelines often involves data extraction from data lakes, data integration across heterogeneous data sources, and diverse operations from data cleaning to analysis. The design and implementation of data science pipelines require domain knowledge, technical expertise, and even project-specific insights. AI systems have shown remarkable reasoning, coding, and understanding capabilities. However, it remains unclear to what extent these capabilities translate into successful design and execution of such complex pipelines. We introduce KRAMABENCH: a benchmark composed of 104 manually-curated real-world data science pipelines spanning 1700 data files from 24 data sources in 6 different domains. We show that these pipelines test the end-to-end capabilities of AI systems on data processing, requiring data discovery, wrangling and cleaning, efficient processing, statistical reasoning, and orchestrating data processing steps given a high-level task. Our evaluation tests 5 general models and 3 code generation models using our reference framework, DS-GURU, which instructs the AI model to decompose a question into a sequence of subtasks, reason through each step, and synthesize Python code that implements the proposed design. Our results on KRAMABENCH show that, although the models are sufficiently capable of solving well-specified data science code generation tasks, when extensive data processing and domain knowledge are required to construct real-world data science pipelines, existing out-of-box models fall short. Progress on KramaBench represents crucial steps towards developing autonomous data science agents for real-world applications. Our code, reference framework, and data are available at https://github.com/mitdbg/KramaBench.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Abstract: This paper proposes AS-ASR, a lightweight aphasia-specific speech recognition framework based on Whisper-tiny, tailored for low-resource deployment on edge devices. Our approach introduces a hybrid training strategy that systematically combines standard and aphasic speech at varying ratios, enabling robust generalization, and a GPT-4-based reference enhancement method that refines noisy aphasic transcripts, improving supervision quality. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple data mixing configurations and evaluation settings. Results show that our fine-tuned model significantly outperforms the zero-shot baseline, reducing WER on aphasic speech by over 30% while preserving performance on standard speech. The proposed framework offers a scalable, efficient solution for real-world disordered speech recognition.

Abstract: Automated sorting is crucial for improving the efficiency and scalability of textile recycling, but accurately identifying material composition and detecting contaminants from sensor data remains challenging. This paper investigates the use of standard RGB imagery, a cost-effective sensing modality, for key pre-processing tasks in an automated system. We present computer vision components designed for a conveyor belt setup to perform (a) classification of four common textile types and (b) segmentation of non-textile features such as buttons and zippers. For classification, several pre-trained architectures were evaluated using transfer learning and cross-validation, with EfficientNetB0 achieving the best performance on a held-out test set with 81.25\% accuracy. For feature segmentation, a zero-shot approach combining the Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detector with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) was employed, demonstrating excellent performance with a mIoU of 0.90 for the generated masks against ground truth. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using RGB images coupled with modern deep learning techniques, including transfer learning for classification and foundation models for zero-shot segmentation, to enable essential analysis steps for automated textile recycling pipelines.

Abstract: Including intricate topological information (e.g., cycles) provably enhances the expressivity of message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) beyond the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. Consequently, Persistent Homology (PH) methods are increasingly employed for graph representation learning. In this context, recent works have proposed decorating classical PH diagrams with vertex and edge features for improved expressivity. However, due to their dependence on features, these methods still fail to capture basic graph structural information. In this paper, we propose SpectRe -- a new topological descriptor for graphs that integrates spectral information into PH diagrams. Notably, SpectRe is strictly more expressive than existing descriptors on graphs. We also introduce notions of global and local stability to analyze existing descriptors and establish that SpectRe is locally stable. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SpectRe and its potential to enhance the capabilities of graph models in relevant learning tasks.

Abstract: The rapid rise of compound AI systems (a.k.a., AI agents) is reshaping the labor market, raising concerns about job displacement, diminished human agency, and overreliance on automation. Yet, we lack a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel auditing framework to assess which occupational tasks workers want AI agents to automate or augment, and how those desires align with the current technological capabilities. Our framework features an audio-enhanced mini-interview to capture nuanced worker desires and introduces the Human Agency Scale (HAS) as a shared language to quantify the preferred level of human involvement. Using this framework, we construct the WORKBank database, building on the U.S. Department of Labor's O*NET database, to capture preferences from 1,500 domain workers and capability assessments from AI experts across over 844 tasks spanning 104 occupations. Jointly considering the desire and technological capability divides tasks in WORKBank into four zones: Automation "Green Light" Zone, Automation "Red Light" Zone, R&amp;D Opportunity Zone, Low Priority Zone. This highlights critical mismatches and opportunities for AI agent development. Moving beyond a simple automate-or-not dichotomy, our results reveal diverse HAS profiles across occupations, reflecting heterogeneous expectations for human involvement. Moreover, our study offers early signals of how AI agent integration may reshape the core human competencies, shifting from information-focused skills to interpersonal ones. These findings underscore the importance of aligning AI agent development with human desires and preparing workers for evolving workplace dynamics.

<title>Towards Efficient Multi-LLM Inference: Characterization and Analysis of LLM Routing and Hierarchical Techniques</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in Language Models (LMs) has dramatically advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP), excelling at tasks like text generation, summarization, and question answering. However, their inference remains computationally expensive and energy intensive, especially in settings with limited hardware, power, or bandwidth. This makes it difficult to deploy LMs in mobile, edge, or cost sensitive environments. To address these challenges, recent approaches have introduced multi LLM intelligent model selection strategies that dynamically allocate computational resources based on query complexity -- using lightweight models for simpler queries and escalating to larger models only when necessary. This survey explores two complementary strategies for efficient LLM inference: (i) routing, which selects the most suitable model based on the query, and (ii) cascading or hierarchical inference (HI), which escalates queries through a sequence of models until a confident response is found. Both approaches aim to reduce computation by using lightweight models for simpler tasks while offloading only when needed. We provide a comparative analysis of these techniques across key performance metrics, discuss benchmarking efforts, and outline open challenges. Finally, we outline future research directions to enable faster response times, adaptive model selection based on task complexity, and scalable deployment across heterogeneous environments, making LLM based systems more efficient and accessible for real world applications.

Abstract: Evolving fuzzy systems build and adapt fuzzy models - such as predictors and controllers - by incrementally updating their rule-base structure from data streams. On the occasion of the 60-year anniversary of fuzzy set theory, commemorated during the Fuzz-IEEE 2025 event, this brief paper revisits the historical development and core contributions of classical fuzzy and adaptive modeling and control frameworks. It then highlights the emergence and significance of evolving intelligent systems in fuzzy modeling and control, emphasizing their advantages in handling nonstationary environments. Key challenges and future directions are discussed, including safety, interpretability, and principled structural evolution.

Abstract: Several machine learning algorithms have been developed for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) from spontaneous speech. However, none of these algorithms have been translated for the prediction of broader cognitive impairment (CI), which in some cases is a precursor and risk factor of ADRD. In this paper, we evaluated several speech-based open-source methods originally proposed for the prediction of ADRD, as well as methods from multimodal sentiment analysis for the task of predicting CI from patient audio recordings. Results demonstrated that multimodal methods outperformed unimodal ones for CI prediction, and that acoustics-based approaches performed better than linguistics-based ones. Specifically, interpretable acoustic features relating to affect and prosody were found to significantly outperform BERT-based linguistic features and interpretable linguistic features, respectively. All the code developed for this study is available at https://github.com/JTColonel/catch.

Abstract: Existing LLM-based medical question-answering systems lack citation generation and evaluation capabilities, raising concerns about their adoption in practice. In this work, we introduce \name, the first end-to-end framework that facilitates the design and evaluation of citation generation with LLMs for medical tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a novel multi-pass retrieval-citation method that generates high-quality citations. Our evaluation highlights the challenges and opportunities of citation generation for medical tasks, while identifying important design choices that have a significant impact on the final citation quality. Our proposed method achieves superior citation precision and recall improvements compared to strong baseline methods, and we show that evaluation results correlate well with annotation results from professional experts.

<title>Training-Free Tokenizer Transplantation via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit</title>

Abstract: We present a training-free method to transplant tokenizers in pretrained large language models (LLMs) by reconstructing unseen token embeddings via Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Specifically, we approximate each out-of-vocabulary token as a sparse linear combination of shared tokens, in two phases: first, compute each new token's representation in the donor embedding space with a small dictionary of shared anchor tokens, then transfer these same sparse coefficients back into the base model's embedding space.
  On two challenging cross-tokenizer tasks--Llama$\to$Mistral NeMo (12B) and Qwen$\to$Llama (1B)--we show that OMP achieves best zero-shot preservation of the base model's performance across multiple benchmarks, while other zero-shot approaches degrade significantly. Compared to baselines (zero-init, mean-init, and existing approaches like WECHSEL, FOCUS, ZETT), OMP consistently achieves the best overall performance, effectively bridging large tokenizer discrepancies without gradient updates. Our analysis further identifies mismatched numerical tokenization schemes as a critical challenge for preserving mathematical reasoning capabilities. This technique enables direct reuse of pretrained model weights with new tokenizers, facilitating cross-tokenizer knowledge distillation, speculative decoding, ensembling, merging, and domain-specific vocabulary adaptations. We integrate our method into the open-source mergekit-tokensurgeon tool for post hoc vocabulary realignment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense promise for revolutionizing financial analysis and decision-making, yet their direct application is often hampered by issues of data hallucination and lack of access to real-time, verifiable financial information. This paper introduces QuantMCP, a novel framework designed to rigorously ground LLMs in financial reality. By leveraging the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized and secure tool invocation, QuantMCP enables LLMs to accurately interface with a diverse array of Python-accessible financial data APIs (e.g., Wind, yfinance). Users can interact via natural language to precisely retrieve up-to-date financial data, thereby overcoming LLM's inherent limitations in factual data recall. More critically, once furnished with this verified, structured data, the LLM's analytical capabilities are unlocked, empowering it to perform sophisticated data interpretation, generate insights, and ultimately support more informed financial decision-making processes. QuantMCP provides a robust, extensible, and secure bridge between conversational AI and the complex world of financial data, aiming to enhance both the reliability and the analytical depth of LLM applications in finance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) policies trained on offline datasets often exhibit degraded task performance when deployed in unfamiliar navigation environments at test time, where agents are typically evaluated without access to external interaction or feedback. Entropy minimization has emerged as a practical solution for reducing prediction uncertainty at test time; however, it can suffer from accumulated errors, as agents may become overconfident in incorrect actions without sufficient contextual grounding. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ATENA (Active TEst-time Navigation Agent), a test-time active learning framework that enables a practical human-robot interaction via episodic feedback on uncertain navigation outcomes. In particular, ATENA learns to increase certainty in successful episodes and decrease it in failed ones, improving uncertainty calibration. Here, we propose mixture entropy optimization, where entropy is obtained from a combination of the action and pseudo-expert distributions-a hypothetical action distribution assuming the agent's selected action to be optimal-controlling both prediction confidence and action preference. In addition, we propose a self-active learning strategy that enables an agent to evaluate its navigation outcomes based on confident predictions. As a result, the agent stays actively engaged throughout all iterations, leading to well-grounded and adaptive decision-making. Extensive evaluations on challenging VLN benchmarks-REVERIE, R2R, and R2R-CE-demonstrate that ATENA successfully overcomes distributional shifts at test time, outperforming the compared baseline methods across various settings.

Abstract: We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H), allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs (1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) identifies the operating status and energy consumption of each electrical device in the circuit by analyzing the electrical signals at the bus, which is of great significance for smart power management. However, the complex and changeable load combinations and application environments lead to the challenges of poor feature robustness and insufficient model generalization of traditional NILM methods. To this end, this paper proposes a new non-intrusive load monitoring method that integrates "image load signature" and continual learning. This method converts multi-dimensional power signals such as current, voltage, and power factor into visual image load feature signatures, and combines deep convolutional neural networks to realize the identification and classification of multiple devices; at the same time, self-supervised pre-training is introduced to improve feature generalization, and continual online learning strategies are used to overcome model forgetting to adapt to the emergence of new loads. This paper conducts a large number of experiments on high-sampling rate load datasets, and compares a variety of existing methods and model variants. The results show that the proposed method has achieved significant improvements in recognition accuracy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in structured prediction tasks, including regression, but existing approaches primarily focus on point estimates and lack systematic comparison across different methods. We investigate probabilistic regression using LLMs for unstructured inputs, addressing challenging text-to-distribution prediction tasks such as price estimation where both nuanced text understanding and uncertainty quantification are critical. We propose a novel quantile regression approach that enables LLMs to produce full predictive distributions, improving upon traditional point estimates. Through extensive experiments across three diverse price prediction datasets, we demonstrate that a Mistral-7B model fine-tuned with quantile heads significantly outperforms traditional approaches for both point and distributional estimations, as measured by three established metrics each for prediction accuracy and distributional calibration. Our systematic comparison of LLM approaches, model architectures, training approaches, and data scaling reveals that Mistral-7B consistently outperforms encoder architectures, embedding-based methods, and few-shot learning methods. Our experiments also reveal the effectiveness of LLM-assisted label correction in achieving human-level accuracy without systematic bias. Our curated datasets are made available at https://github.com/vnik18/llm-price-quantile-reg/ to support future research.

Abstract: Video generative models trained on expert demonstrations have been utilized as performant text-conditioned visual planners for solving robotic tasks. However, generalization to unseen tasks remains a challenge. Whereas improved generalization may be facilitated by leveraging learned prior knowledge from additional pre-collected offline data sources, such as web-scale video datasets, in the era of experience we aim to design agents that can continuously improve in an online manner from self-collected behaviors. In this work we thus propose the Self-Adapting Improvement Loop (SAIL), where an in-domain video model iteratively updates itself on self-produced trajectories, collected through adaptation with an internet-scale pretrained video model, and steadily improves its performance for a specified task of interest. We apply SAIL to a diverse suite of MetaWorld tasks, as well as two manipulation tasks on a real robot arm, and find that performance improvements continuously emerge over multiple iterations for novel tasks initially unseen during original in-domain video model training. Furthermore, we discover that SAIL is surprisingly robust regarding if and how the self-collected experience is filtered, and the quality of the initial in-domain demonstrations. Through adaptation with summarized internet-scale data, and learning through online experience, we thus demonstrate a way to iteratively bootstrap a high-performance video model for solving novel robotic tasks through self-improvement.

Abstract: In complex driving environments, autonomous vehicles must navigate safely. Relying on a single predicted path, as in regression-based approaches, usually does not explicitly assess the safety of the predicted trajectory. Selection-based methods address this by generating and scoring multiple trajectory candidates and predicting the safety score for each, but face optimization challenges in precisely selecting the best option from thousands of possibilities and distinguishing subtle but safety-critical differences, especially in rare or underrepresented scenarios. We propose DriveSuprim to overcome these challenges and advance the selection-based paradigm through a coarse-to-fine paradigm for progressive candidate filtering, a rotation-based augmentation method to improve robustness in out-of-distribution scenarios, and a self-distillation framework to stabilize training. DriveSuprim achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 93.5% PDMS in NAVSIM v1 and 87.1% EPDMS in NAVSIM v2 without extra data, demonstrating superior safetycritical capabilities, including collision avoidance and compliance with rules, while maintaining high trajectory quality in various driving scenarios.

Abstract: Dual-arm robots play a crucial role in improving efficiency and flexibility in complex multitasking scenarios. While existing methods have achieved promising results in task planning, they often fail to fully optimize task parallelism, limiting the potential of dual-arm collaboration. To address this issue, we propose RoboPARA, a novel large language model (LLM)-driven framework for dual-arm task parallelism planning. RoboPARA employs a two-stage process: (1) Dependency Graph-based Planning Candidates Generation, which constructs directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies and eliminate redundancy, and (2) Graph Re-Traversal-based Dual-Arm Parallel Planning, which optimizes DAG traversal to maximize parallelism while maintaining task coherence. In addition, we introduce the Cross-Scenario Dual-Arm Parallel Task dataset (X-DAPT dataset), the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate dual-arm task parallelism across diverse scenarios and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments on the X-DAPT dataset demonstrate that RoboPARA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving higher efficiency and reliability, particularly in complex task combinations. The code and dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the RISC-V instruction set architecture, focusing on its modular design, implementation challenges, and performance characteristics. We examine the RV32I base instruction set with extensions for multiplication (M) and atomic operations (A). Through cycle-accurate simulation of a pipelined implementation, we evaluate performance metrics including CPI (cycles per instruction) and power efficiency. Our results demonstrate RISC-V's advantages in embedded systems and its scalability for custom accelerators. Comparative analysis shows a 17% reduction in power consumption compared to ARM Cortex-M0 implementations in similar process nodes. The open-standard nature of RISC-V provides significant flexibility for domain-specific optimizations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at few-shot learning via in-context learning (ICL). However, the effectiveness of ICL is often sensitive to the selection and ordering of demonstration examples. To address this, we present MarginSel: Max-Margin Demonstration Selection for LLMs, a two-step method that selects hard demonstration examples for the ICL prompt, adapting to each test instance. Our approach achieves 2-7% absolute improvement in F1-score across classification tasks, compared to a random selection of examples. We also provide theoretical insights and empirical evidence showing that MarginSel induces max-margin behavior in LLMs by effectively increasing the margin for hard examples, analogous to support vectors, thereby shifting the decision boundary in a beneficial direction.

Abstract: Deep neural networks, particularly Transformers, have been widely adopted for predicting the functional properties of proteins. In this work, we focus on exploring whether Protein Transformers can capture biological intelligence among protein sequences. To achieve our goal, we first introduce a protein function dataset, namely Protein-FN, providing over 9000 protein data with meaningful labels. Second, we devise a new Transformer architecture, namely Sequence Protein Transformers (SPT), for computationally efficient protein function predictions. Third, we develop a novel Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) technique called Sequence Score, which can efficiently interpret the decision-making processes of protein models, thereby overcoming the difficulty of deciphering biological intelligence bided in Protein Transformers. Remarkably, even our smallest SPT-Tiny model, which contains only 5.4M parameters, demonstrates impressive predictive accuracy, achieving 94.3% on the Antibiotic Resistance (AR) dataset and 99.6% on the Protein-FN dataset, all accomplished by training from scratch. Besides, our Sequence Score technique helps reveal that our SPT models can discover several meaningful patterns underlying the sequence structures of protein data, with these patterns aligning closely with the domain knowledge in the biology community. We have officially released our Protein-FN dataset on Hugging Face Datasets https://huggingface.co/datasets/Protein-FN/Protein-FN. Our code is available at https://github.com/fudong03/BioIntelligence.

Abstract: Detecting LLM-generated text in specialized and high-stakes domains like medicine and law is crucial for combating misinformation and ensuring authenticity. However, current zero-shot detectors, while effective on general text, often fail when applied to specialized content due to domain shift. We provide a theoretical analysis showing this failure is fundamentally linked to the KL divergence between human, detector, and source text distributions. To address this, we propose DivScore, a zero-shot detection framework using normalized entropy-based scoring and domain knowledge distillation to robustly identify LLM-generated text in specialized domains. We also release a domain-specific benchmark for LLM-generated text detection in the medical and legal domains. Experiments on our benchmark show that DivScore consistently outperforms state-of-the-art detectors, with 14.4% higher AUROC and 64.0% higher recall (0.1% false positive rate threshold). In adversarial settings, DivScore demonstrates superior robustness than other baselines, achieving on average 22.8% advantage in AUROC and 29.5% in recall. Code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Mitigating human-wildlife conflict seeks to resolve unwanted encounters between these parties. Computer Vision provides a solution to identifying individuals that might escalate into conflict, such as members of the Big Five African animals. However, environments often contain several varied species. The current state-of-the-art animal classification models are trained under a closed-world assumption. They almost always remain overconfident in their predictions even when presented with unknown classes. This study investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) detection of wildlife, specifically the Big Five. To this end, we select a parametric Nearest Class Mean (NCM) and a non-parametric contrastive learning approach as baselines to take advantage of pretrained and projected features from popular classification encoders. Moreover, we compare our baselines to various common OOD methods in the literature. The results show feature-based methods reflect stronger generalisation capability across varying classification thresholds. Specifically, NCM with ImageNet pre-trained features achieves a 2%, 4% and 22% improvement on AUPR-IN, AUPR-OUT and AUTC over the best OOD methods, respectively. The code can be found here https://github.com/pxpana/BIG5OOD

Abstract: The rapid global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has established electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) as a critical component of smart grid infrastructure. While essential for ensuring reliable energy delivery and accessibility, EVSE systems face significant cybersecurity challenges, including network reconnaissance, backdoor intrusions, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. These emerging threats, driven by the interconnected and autonomous nature of EVSE, require innovative and adaptive security mechanisms that go beyond traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Existing approaches, whether network-based or host-based, often fail to detect sophisticated and targeted attacks specifically crafted to exploit new vulnerabilities in EVSE infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel intrusion detection framework that leverages multimodal data sources, including network traffic and kernel events, to identify complex attack patterns. The framework employs a distributed learning approach, enabling collaborative intelligence across EVSE stations while preserving data privacy through federated learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing solutions, achieving a detection rate above 98% and a precision rate exceeding 97% in decentralized environments. This solution addresses the evolving challenges of EVSE security, offering a scalable and privacypreserving response to advanced cyber threats

Abstract: Audio bandwidth extension is the task of reconstructing missing high frequency components of bandwidth-limited audio signals, where bandwidth limitation is a common issue for audio signals due to several reasons, including channel capacity and data constraints. While conventional spectral band replication is a well-established parametric approach to audio bandwidth extension, the SBR usually entails coarse feature extraction and reconstruction techniques, which leads to limitations when processing various types of audio signals. In parallel, numerous deep neural network-based audio bandwidth extension methods have been proposed. These DNN-based methods are usually referred to as blind BWE, as these methods do not rely on prior information extracted from original signals, and only utilize given low frequency band signals to estimate missing high frequency components. In order to replace conventional SBR with DNNs, simply adopting existing DNN-based methodologies results in suboptimal performance due to the blindness of these methods. My proposed research suggests a new approach to parametric non-blind bandwidth extension, as DNN-based side information extraction and DNN-based bandwidth extension are performed only at the front and end of the audio coding pipeline.

Abstract: Smart contracts, integral to blockchain ecosystems, enable decentralized applications to execute predefined operations without intermediaries. Their ability to enforce trustless interactions has made them a core component of platforms such as Ethereum. Vulnerabilities such as numerical overflows, reentrancy attacks, and improper access permissions have led to the loss of millions of dollars throughout the blockchain and smart contract sector. Traditional smart contract auditing techniques such as manual code reviews and formal verification face limitations in scalability, automation, and adaptability to evolving development patterns. As a result, AI-based solutions have emerged as a promising alternative, offering the ability to learn complex patterns, detect subtle flaws, and provide scalable security assurances. This paper examines novel AI-driven techniques for vulnerability detection in smart contracts, focusing on machine learning, deep learning, graph neural networks, and transformer-based models. This paper analyzes how each technique represents code, processes semantic information, and responds to real world vulnerability classes. We also compare their strengths and weaknesses in terms of accuracy, interpretability, computational overhead, and real time applicability. Lastly, it highlights open challenges and future opportunities for advancing this domain.

Abstract: Navigating healthcare systems can be complex and overwhelming, creating barriers for patients seeking timely and appropriate medical attention. In this paper, we introduce C-PATH (Conversational Patient Assistance and Triage in Healthcare), a novel conversational AI system powered by large language models (LLMs) designed to assist patients in recognizing symptoms and recommending appropriate medical departments through natural, multi-turn dialogues. C-PATH is fine-tuned on medical knowledge, dialogue data, and clinical summaries using a multi-stage pipeline built on the LLaMA3 architecture. A core contribution of this work is a GPT-based data augmentation framework that transforms structured clinical knowledge from DDXPlus into lay-person-friendly conversations, allowing alignment with patient communication norms. We also implement a scalable conversation history management strategy to ensure long-range coherence. Evaluation with GPTScore demonstrates strong performance across dimensions such as clarity, informativeness, and recommendation accuracy. Quantitative benchmarks show that C-PATH achieves superior performance in GPT-rewritten conversational datasets, significantly outperforming domain-specific baselines. C-PATH represents a step forward in the development of user-centric, accessible, and accurate AI tools for digital health assistance and triage.

<title>Depth-Optimal Quantum Layout Synthesis as SAT</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits consist of gates applied to qubits. Current quantum hardware platforms impose connectivity restrictions on binary CX gates. Hence, Layout Synthesis is an important step to transpile quantum circuits before they can be executed. Since CX gates are noisy, it is important to reduce the CX count or CX depth of the mapped circuits.
  We provide a new and efficient encoding of Quantum-circuit Layout Synthesis in SAT. Previous SAT encodings focused on gate count and CX-gate count. Our encoding instead guarantees that we find mapped circuits with minimal circuit depth or minimal CX-gate depth. We use incremental SAT solving and parallel plans for an efficient encoding. This results in speedups of more than 10-100x compared to OLSQ2, which guarantees depth-optimality. But minimizing depth still takes more time than minimizing gate count with Q-Synth.
  We correlate the noise reduction achieved by simulating circuits after (CX)-count and (CX)-depth reduction. We find that minimizing for CX-count correlates better with reducing noise than minimizing for CX-depth. However, taking into account both CX-count and CX-depth provides the best noise reduction.

<title>Feature-Based Instance Neighbor Discovery: Advanced Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic World</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.06782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite progress, deep neural networks still suffer performance declines under distribution shifts between training and test domains, leading to a substantial decrease in Quality of Experience (QoE) for applications. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods are challenged by dynamic, multiple test distributions within batches. We observe that feature distributions across different domains inherently cluster into distinct groups with varying means and variances. This divergence reveals a critical limitation of previous global normalization strategies in TTA, which inevitably distort the original data characteristics. Based on this insight, we propose Feature-based Instance Neighbor Discovery (FIND), which comprises three key components: Layer-wise Feature Disentanglement (LFD), Feature Aware Batch Normalization (FABN) and Selective FABN (S-FABN). LFD stably captures features with similar distributions at each layer by constructing graph structures. While FABN optimally combines source statistics with test-time distribution specific statistics for robust feature representation. Finally, S-FABN determines which layers require feature partitioning and which can remain unified, thereby enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FIND significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 30\% accuracy improvement in dynamic scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency.

<title>Is Optimal Transport Necessary for Inverse Reinforcement Learning?</title>

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) aims to recover a reward function from expert demonstrations. Recently, Optimal Transport (OT) methods have been successfully deployed to align trajectories and infer rewards. While OT-based methods have shown strong empirical results, they introduce algorithmic complexity, hyperparameter sensitivity, and require solving the OT optimization problems. In this work, we challenge the necessity of OT in IRL by proposing two simple, heuristic alternatives: (1) Minimum-Distance Reward, which assigns rewards based on the nearest expert state regardless of temporal order; and (2) Segment-Matching Reward, which incorporates lightweight temporal alignment by matching agent states to corresponding segments in the expert trajectory. These methods avoid optimization, exhibit linear-time complexity, and are easy to implement. Through extensive evaluations across 32 online and offline benchmarks with three reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that our simple rewards match or outperform recent OT-based approaches. Our findings suggest that the core benefits of OT may arise from basic proximity alignment rather than its optimal coupling formulation, advocating for reevaluation of complexity in future IRL design.

<title>Label-semantics Aware Generative Approach for Domain-Agnostic Multilabel Classification</title>

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification. Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Abstract: Can language models reliably predict that possible events are more likely than merely improbable ones? By teasing apart possibility, typicality, and contextual relatedness, we show that despite the results of previous work, language models' ability to do this is far from robust. In fact, under certain conditions, all models tested - including Llama 3, Gemma 2, and Mistral NeMo - perform at worse-than-chance level, assigning higher probabilities to impossible sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the brake' than to merely unlikely sentences such as 'the car was given a parking ticket by the explorer'.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been increasingly applied to diverse downstream tasks due to their superior generalization capabilities and low annotation costs. However, most existing heterogeneous graph SSL models convert heterogeneous graphs into homogeneous ones via meta-paths for training, which only leverage information from nodes at both ends of meta-paths while underutilizing the heterogeneous node information along the meta-paths. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework named IMPA-HGAE to enhance target node embeddings by fully exploiting internal node information along meta-paths. Experimental results validate that IMPA-HGAE achieves superior performance on heterogeneous datasets. Furthermore, this paper introduce innovative masking strategies to strengthen the representational capacity of generative SSL models on heterogeneous graph data. Additionally, this paper discuss the interpretability of the proposed method and potential future directions for generative self-supervised learning in heterogeneous graphs. This work provides insights into leveraging meta-path-guided structural semantics for robust representation learning in complex graph scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Modeling 3D language fields with Gaussian Splatting for open-ended language queries has recently garnered increasing attention. However, recent 3DGS-based models leverage view-dependent 2D foundation models to refine 3D semantics but lack a unified 3D representation, leading to view inconsistencies. Additionally, inherent open-vocabulary challenges cause inconsistencies in object and relational descriptions, impeding hierarchical semantic understanding. In this paper, we propose Hi-LSplat, a view-consistent Hierarchical Language Gaussian Splatting work for 3D open-vocabulary querying. To achieve view-consistent 3D hierarchical semantics, we first lift 2D features to 3D features by constructing a 3D hierarchical semantic tree with layered instance clustering, which addresses the view inconsistency issue caused by 2D semantic features. Besides, we introduce instance-wise and part-wise contrastive losses to capture all-sided hierarchical semantic representations. Notably, we construct two hierarchical semantic datasets to better assess the model's ability to distinguish different semantic levels. Extensive experiments highlight our method's superiority in 3D open-vocabulary segmentation and localization. Its strong performance on hierarchical semantic datasets underscores its ability to capture complex hierarchical semantics within 3D scenes.

Abstract: Visual Prompting (VP), an efficient method for transfer learning, has shown its potential in vision tasks. However, previous works focus exclusively on VP from standard source models, it is still unknown how it performs under the scenario of a robust source model: Can the robustness of the source model be successfully inherited? Does VP also encounter the same trade-off between robustness and generalization ability as the source model during this process? If such a trade-off exists, is there a strategy specifically tailored to VP to mitigate this limitation? In this paper, we thoroughly explore these three questions for the first time and provide affirmative answers to them. To mitigate the trade-off faced by VP, we propose a strategy called Prompt Boundary Loosening (PBL). As a lightweight, plug-and-play strategy naturally compatible with VP, PBL effectively ensures the successful inheritance of robustness when the source model is a robust model, while significantly enhancing VP's generalization ability across various downstream datasets. Extensive experiments across various datasets show that our findings are universal and demonstrate the significant benefits of the proposed strategy.

Abstract: We provide an attention-level control method for the task of coupled image generation, where "coupled" means that multiple simultaneously generated images are expected to have the same or very similar backgrounds. While backgrounds coupled, the centered objects in the generated images are still expected to enjoy the flexibility raised from different text prompts. The proposed method disentangles the background and entity components in the model's cross-attention modules, attached with a sequence of time-varying weight control parameters depending on the time step of sampling. We optimize this sequence of weight control parameters with a combined objective that assesses how coupled the backgrounds are as well as text-to-image alignment and overall visual quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches across these criteria.

Abstract: Endoscopic surgery is the gold standard for robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery, offering significant advantages in early disease detection and precise interventions. However, the complexity of surgical scenes, characterized by high variability in different surgical activity scenarios and confused image features between targets and the background, presents challenges for surgical environment understanding. Traditional deep learning models often struggle with cross-activity interference, leading to suboptimal performance in each downstream task. To address this limitation, we explore multi-task learning, which utilizes the interrelated features between tasks to enhance overall task performance. In this paper, we propose EndoARSS, a novel multi-task learning framework specifically designed for endoscopy surgery activity recognition and semantic segmentation. Built upon the DINOv2 foundation model, our approach integrates Low-Rank Adaptation to facilitate efficient fine-tuning while incorporating Task Efficient Shared Low-Rank Adapters to mitigate gradient conflicts across diverse tasks. Additionally, we introduce the Spatially-Aware Multi-Scale Attention that enhances feature representation discrimination by enabling cross-spatial learning of global information. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we present three novel datasets, MTLESD, MTLEndovis and MTLEndovis-Gen, tailored for endoscopic surgery scenarios with detailed annotations for both activity recognition and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EndoARSS achieves remarkable performance across multiple benchmarks, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness in comparison to existing models. These results underscore the potential of EndoARSS to advance AI-driven endoscopic surgical systems, offering valuable insights for enhancing surgical safety and efficiency.

<title>Harnessing Vision-Language Models for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) has played a vital role in a variety of fields, including healthcare, finance, and industrial monitoring. Prior methods, which mainly focus on training domain-specific models on numerical data, lack the visual-temporal reasoning capacity that human experts have to identify contextual anomalies. To fill this gap, we explore a solution based on vision language models (VLMs). Recent studies have shown the ability of VLMs for visual reasoning tasks, yet their direct application to time series has fallen short on both accuracy and efficiency. To harness the power of VLMs for TSAD, we propose a two-stage solution, with (1) ViT4TS, a vision-screening stage built on a relatively lightweight pretrained vision encoder, which leverages 2-D time-series representations to accurately localize candidate anomalies; (2) VLM4TS, a VLM-based stage that integrates global temporal context and VLM reasoning capacity to refine the detection upon the candidates provided by ViT4TS. We show that without any time-series training, VLM4TS outperforms time-series pretrained and from-scratch baselines in most cases, yielding a 24.6 percent improvement in F1-max score over the best baseline. Moreover, VLM4TS also consistently outperforms existing language-model-based TSAD methods and is on average 36 times more efficient in token usage.

Abstract: The challenge of finding compromises between agent proposals is fundamental to AI subfields such as argumentation, mediation, and negotiation. Building on this tradition, Elkind et al. (2021) introduced a process for coalition formation that seeks majority-supported proposals preferable to the status quo, using a metric space where each agent has an ideal point. A crucial step in this process involves identifying compromise proposals around which agent coalitions can unite. How to effectively find such compromise proposals remains an open question. We address this gap by formalizing a model that incorporates agent bounded rationality and uncertainty, and by developing AI methods to generate compromise proposals. We focus on the domain of collaborative document writing, such as the democratic drafting of a community constitution. Our approach uses natural language processing techniques and large language models to induce a semantic metric space over text. Based on this space, we design algorithms to suggest compromise points likely to receive broad support. To evaluate our methods, we simulate coalition formation processes and show that AI can facilitate large-scale democratic text editing, a domain where traditional tools are limited.

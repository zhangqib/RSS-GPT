<div> Framework, ethics requirements, multi-agent LLM, system description, human feedback

Summary:
The study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. It aims to address the challenges of eliciting manual ethics requirements, such as time and resource constraints. The framework was evaluated through two case studies, demonstrating its ability to capture a significant number of ethics requirements and introduce relevant additional ones. However, it also identified reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the importance of human feedback in this sensitive domain. Overall, the framework offers a promising approach to incorporating ethics into the requirements engineering process and creating ethically aligned systems. It provides a practical solution to the low priority often given to ethics in the requirements elicitation process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

<div> personalized feedback, curriculum-aligned, science education, error-aware assessment, modular system

Summary:
LearnLens is a modular system based on Language Model (LLM) technology designed to provide personalized feedback in science education. The system consists of three components: an error-aware assessment module that identifies nuanced reasoning errors, a curriculum-grounded generation module that utilizes a structured memory chain for feedback generation, and an educator-in-the-loop interface for customization and oversight. By using a topic-linked memory chain instead of traditional similarity-based retrieval, LearnLens delivers more relevant feedback while reducing unnecessary noise. This approach addresses the challenges faced by existing feedback systems, offering scalable and high-quality feedback that benefits both teachers and students. With LearnLens, educators can efficiently provide effective feedback that enhances student learning in a curriculum-aligned manner. <div>

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in end-to-end AI music generation, AI-driven modeling of professional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workflows remains challenging. In particular, while there is growing interest in neural black-box modeling of audio effect graphs (e.g. reverb, compression, equalization), AI-based approaches struggle to replicate the nuanced signal flow and parameter interactions used in professional workflows. Existing differentiable plugin approaches often diverge from real-world tools, exhibiting inferior performance relative to simplified neural controllers under equivalent computational constraints. We introduce WildFX, a pipeline containerized with Docker for generating multi-track audio mixing datasets with rich effect graphs, powered by a professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) backend. WildFX supports seamless integration of cross-platform commercial plugins or any plugins in the wild, in VST/VST3/LV2/CLAP formats, enabling structural complexity (e.g., sidechains, crossovers) and achieving efficient parallelized processing. A minimalist metadata interface simplifies project/plugin configuration. Experiments demonstrate the pipeline's validity through blind estimation of mixing graphs, plugin/gain parameters, and its ability to bridge AI research with practical DSP demands. The code is available on: https://github.com/IsaacYQH/WildFX.

<div> GraphTrafficGPT, Large Language Models, traffic management, graph-based architecture, task coordination <br />
<br />
GraphTrafficGPT is proposed as an improved architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs) in traffic management. It utilizes a graph-based approach to represent tasks and dependencies, enabling parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The model includes a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for various tasks. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2%, average response latency by 19.0%, and improves efficiency by 23.0% for multi-query execution compared to TrafficGPT. These enhancements make GraphTrafficGPT more efficient for complex, real-world scenarios in urban mobility environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability, making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture, which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to 23.0% improvement in efficiency.

<div> community values, preference modeling, attribute dimensions, human judgment, social communities 

Summary: 
PrefPalette introduces a framework for personalizing AI systems by understanding the underlying reasons for user preferences. It decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its prediction to distinct social community values. The approach uses a multi-attribute decision-making principle, involving a counterfactual attribute synthesis step and attention-based preference modeling. It moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture diverse evaluation frameworks driving human judgment. Evaluated on 45 Reddit communities, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by 46.6% in prediction accuracy. The model reveals community-specific profiles: scholarly communities focus on verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities emphasize empathy. PrefPalette not only provides superior preference modeling but also offers transparent and interpretable insights into human judgment, aiming to create more trustworthy and value-aware personalized applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer, but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its preference prediction to distinct social community values in a human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality, humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes. This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by 46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements, PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles: scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet, those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts. This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications in sensitive domains.

<title>Why Isn't Relational Learning Taking Over the World?</title>

<div> keywords: AI, entities, relational learning, statistical relational AI, data <br />
Summary: Relational learning, a field focusing on modeling entities and their relationships, is not as prevalent as pixel and word-based AI systems. Despite valuable data existing in relational formats like spreadsheets and databases, the prominence of relational learning remains limited. The paper highlights the importance of shifting focus towards modeling entities and their properties, emphasizing the need to incorporate relational learning into mainstream AI practices. Its rightful prominence can be achieved through addressing the challenges and limitations that currently hinder its widespread adoption. <div>
arXiv:2507.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

<div> Keywords: Information retrieval, question answering, safety regulations, compliance checking, BifrostRAG

Summary:
BifrostRAG is introduced as a dual-graph RAG-integrated system for information retrieval and question answering in safety regulations. It addresses the complexity of regulatory text by modeling linguistic relationships and document structure through two graphs. The system combines graph traversal with semantic search, enabling large language models to reason over text meaning and structure. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset demonstrates BifrostRAG's precision of 92.8%, recall of 85.5%, and F1 score of 87.3%, outperforming current approaches. Error analysis showcases the advantages of the hybrid method over vector-only and graph-only systems. BifrostRAG is established as a robust knowledge engine for compliance checking driven by large language models. Its dual-graph, hybrid retrieval mechanism offers a blueprint for navigating complex technical documents in knowledge-intensive engineering domains. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure (via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search, enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1 score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

<div> intelligent tutoring systems, error diagnosis, final answer, automated diagnosis, quadratic equations  
Summary:  
- Many intelligent tutoring systems support students in stepwise tasks, but diagnosing errors when steps are combined can be challenging due to combinatorial explosion.  
- Using a final answer for diagnosis can help reduce the complexity, as there are fewer possible erroneous final answers compared to solution paths.  
- This study explores automated error diagnosis based on final answers, aiming to provide buggy rule diagnosis when students combine steps.  
- Applying this approach to a dataset of student steps in solving quadratic equations showed a 29.4% success rate in diagnosing previously undiagnosed steps.  
- Comparing generated diagnoses with teacher diagnoses on a subset of cases revealed a 97% alignment, indicating the potential effectiveness of the final answer evaluation approach.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous) solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the approach.

<div> Model tracing, constraint-based modeling, student input diagnosis, stepwise tasks, multistep strategy diagnoses <br />
Summary:
This study introduces an approach that combines model tracing and constraint-based modeling for diagnosing student input in stepwise tasks. By defining constraints as properties shared between student input and a strategy step, the system can provide diagnoses even when students deviate from a strategy or combine multiple steps. The system design for multistep strategy diagnoses is explored, and evaluations are conducted using a dataset of students solving quadratic equations. Results show that the system's diagnoses align with human coding, with 100% agreement on 140 student steps. This approach offers a comprehensive method for diagnosing student input in educational settings, enhancing the understanding of student problem-solving processes. <div>
arXiv:2507.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations (n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student steps.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces DailyLLM, a novel system for generating and summarizing activity logs that integrates contextual information from location, motion, environment, and physiology dimensions. It utilizes sensors commonly found in smartphones and smartwatches to achieve high-level activity understanding. DailyLLM employs a lightweight framework that combines structured prompting and efficient feature extraction to improve accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness in log generation. Experimental results show that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 17% improvement in log generation precision compared to baseline models with 70B parameters. Additionally, DailyLLM demonstrates nearly 10 times faster inference speed, making it suitable for deployment on personal computers and Raspberry Pi platforms. <div>

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing. The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion, environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference speed.

Summary:
OntView is a new ontology viewer that aims to address the challenge of effectively visualizing ontology structures. It provides users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Utilizing a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" approach, displaying actual inferred knowledge. One key feature is its ability to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a function lacking in existing tools. To prevent overwhelming users with information, OntView offers methods to simplify views, such as creating ontology summaries based on concept importance, focusing on TBox elements between specific classes, and dynamically hiding/showing branches without losing semantics. The tool has been released with an open-source license, benefiting the entire community.

arXiv:2507.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users' ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm, showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload, OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts (according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics. OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

Summary: 
The article introduces a hybrid architecture for agent-augmented strategic reasoning that combines heuristic extraction, semantic activation, and compositional synthesis. Drawing from various sources, including classical military theory and contemporary corporate strategy, the model activates and composes multiple heuristics using a process of semantic interdependence inspired by quantum cognition. Unlike traditional decision engines, the system integrates conflicting heuristics into coherent and context-sensitive narratives guided by semantic interaction modeling and rhetorical framing. The framework is demonstrated through a case study of Meta vs. FTC and is preliminarily validated using semantic metrics.

Summary: 
EAGLE is introduced as a lightweight framework for temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs. It integrates short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns through a time-aware module and structure-aware module respectively. EAGLE utilizes an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance these attributes dynamically. Unlike existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, resulting in significant improvements in efficiency. Experimental results on real-world temporal graphs show that EAGLE outperforms state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a speedup of over 50x compared to effective transformer-based T-GNNs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

While existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

<div> Framework, Multi-agent reinforcement learning, Knowledge transfer, Causal representation, Non-stationary environment

Summary: 
The paper introduces a causal knowledge transfer framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning in non-stationary environments. Traditional methods struggle to transfer knowledge efficiently, often requiring costly retraining. The framework enables agents to share compact causal representations of paths, allowing for adaptive recovery strategies in response to changing obstacles. Each collision is modeled as a causal intervention, represented by a sequence of recovery actions transferred online from another agent. Results show that agents with different goals were able to bridge the gap between random exploration and fully retrained policies when adapting to new environments. The impact of causal knowledge transfer depends on the complexity of the environment and the diversity of agents' goals. <div>

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However, transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results] Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

Summary:
The paper discusses the challenge of generating innovative ideas using large language models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence. LLMs often struggle to produce novel and relevant outputs as they tend to replicate patterns from their training data. Existing solutions rely on domain-specific rules and structured prompts, which are not easily adaptable. The proposed model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework offers a scalable and controlled approach to creativity by navigating the continuous idea embedding space. Unlike previous methods, this framework requires no handcrafted rules and can be easily adapted to various domains, input formats, and creative tasks. The paper presents a prototype of the framework and initial results that showcase its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.

<div> Keywords: Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, Cross-modal Causal Intervention, Diagnosis, Multi-modal Learning <br />

Summary: 
The study presents a novel framework called ADPC for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease by integrating visual and language data. Mild Cognitive Impairment is identified as a precursor to AD, making early detection crucial. The framework utilizes a large language model to summarize clinical data and distinguish between Cognitively Normal, MCI, and AD cases using MRI and fMRI images. By addressing confounders through causal intervention, the model achieves superior performance in classification tasks. The study highlights the importance of causal reasoning in multi-modal learning for improving neurological disease diagnosis. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets. The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric resolution presents significant challenges for logic-based approaches like Answer Set Programming (ASP). To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints, enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Summary: 
KROMA is a novel Ontology Matching framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enhance semantic context with various types of knowledge.

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability, yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching, outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology matching at scale.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are a critical part of state-of-the-art digital health technology for diabetes management. Yet, access to large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of robust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible, and robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly available diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 - 2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction across all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML collection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different prediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings from this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust AI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain. We provide direct links to each longitudinal diabetes dataset in the Glucose-ML collection and openly provide our code.

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks. G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities, and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study, several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions. Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization to address the increasing demand for GPU resources driven by Large Language Models. Despite previous models showing limited success in improving CUDA speed, CUDA-L1 delivers significant performance improvements, achieving an average speedup of x17.7 on NVIDIA A100 across 250 CUDA kernels. The model exhibits portability across different GPU architectures, showing average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, and more. Additionally, CUDA-L1 displays the ability to discover and strategically combine various CUDA optimization techniques, uncover fundamental principles, and identify performance bottlenecks. The trained RL model can autonomously optimize CUDA operations without human expertise, offering great potential to enhance GPU efficiency and alleviate resource pressure. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning (VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only 1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models, coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017}) marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture for large language models.

Abstract: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and automation (EDA) tools, high-performance computing, and parallelized algorithms are essential for next-generation microprocessor innovation, ensuring continued progress in computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. Machine learning-based design rule checking (DRC) and lithography hotspot detection can improve first-pass silicon success. However, conventional ML and neural network (NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset (in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy, respectively. In addition, the proposed methodology has about 26.3x and up to 6003x lower training times compared to SVM and NN-models, respectively.

Summary:<br />
Visual Language Models (VLMs) are successful in complex visual tasks like VQA but struggle with basic perceptual tests. This study evaluates VLMs' ability for nonlocal visual reasoning, including comparative perception, saccadic search, and smooth visual search. Flagship models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-o4-mini fail these tests, showing low accuracy compared to human performance on tasks that are easy for humans. Despite improvements in visual acuity, current models lack essential visual reasoning abilities required for solving nonlocal visual tasks. <div>

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models' capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

<br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the spatial reasoning abilities of vision-language models (VLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning. The research evaluates different prompting strategies and finds that simple CoT formats do not improve performance, while structured multi-stage prompting based on scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) enhances spatial reasoning accuracy significantly. Fine-tuning models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset leads to higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), showing better robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. SFT may overfit to linguistic patterns, causing degraded performance with test-time phrasing changes, but GRPO generalizes reliably and maintains stable performance under such shifts. The study offers valuable insights on how reinforcement learning and structured prompting can enhance spatial reasoning capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular, we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open source at: https://github.com/Yvonne511/spatial-vlm-investigator

<div> Keywords: 3D object detection, vision-language models, open-world settings, geometric inflation, Pseudo-nuScenes

Summary: 
This work presents a novel approach to 3D object detection using 2D vision-language models trained on web-scale image-text pairs. By leveraging the semantic understanding of these models, the pipeline generates text-conditioned proposals for 3D object detection without the need for human-annotated 3D labels. The method utilizes camera geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth for 3D projection of proposals and introduces a geometric inflation strategy for inferring 3D bounding boxes without training. Additionally, a fog-augmented, RGB-only dataset called Pseudo-nuScenes is created to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show competitive localization performance with LiDAR-based and RGB-D inputs, emphasizing the scalability and open-vocabulary nature of the approach. The code and resources are open-sourced for further research and development.

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D perception. We open-source our code and resources at https://github.com/atharv0goel/open-world-3D-det.

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12 different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining strategy and adapted multitask training.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel method called CMV-ND for deep graph clustering (DGC) to address the challenges of large-scale and attribute-missing attribute graphs. CMV-ND preprocesses graph structural information into multiple views using a recursive neighborhood search and a neighborhood differential strategy to ensure completeness and non-redundancy. This approach constructs complementary views from differential hop representations and node features, which are then used in existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods. Experimental results on various graph datasets show that CMV-ND significantly enhances the performance of different methods in graph clustering tasks. <div>

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation. However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions, are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary \underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew \underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation (\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity for hardware design automation, particularly through Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. In this work, we examine the current literature on RTL generation using LLMs and identify key requirements for training and fine-tuning datasets. We construct a robust Verilog dataset through an automated three-pronged process involving database (DB) creation and management with PostgreSQL, data collection from code hosting sites like OpenCores and GitHub, and data preprocessing to verify the codes' syntax, run logic synthesis, and extract relevant module metadata. We implement a scalable and efficient DB infrastructure to support analysis and detail our preprocessing pipeline to enforce high-quality data before DB insertion. The resulting dataset comprises 20,392 Verilog samples, 751 MB of Verilog code data, which is the largest high-quality Verilog dataset for LLM fine-tuning to our knowledge. We further evaluate the dataset, address associated challenges, and explore potential applications for future research and development in LLM-based hardware generation.

Summary: 
The article introduces the H-NeiFi framework, a hierarchical and non-intrusive approach to guiding opinions on social media platforms towards global consensus. By considering social roles and behavioral characteristics of users, the framework aims to optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Unlike existing methods that directly modify user views or enforce connections, H-NeiFi prioritizes user autonomy and avoids intrusive interventions. Experimental results demonstrate that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed and maintains global convergence, even in the absence of experts. This approach offers a natural and efficient way to guide opinion evolution on social networks while preventing divisions at the macro level, providing a new paradigm for social network governance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.

Traditional dense text captions are effective but expensive, missing critical visual information. ModaRoute uses GPT-4.1 to analyze query intent, predicting information needs to reduce computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. By routing queries across ASR, OCR, and visual indices, the system averages 1.78 modalities per query, outperforming the exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips shows that intelligent routing is a practical solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems, reducing costs while maintaining competitive effectiveness in real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR (speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Summary: 
PersonaGen introduces a framework for generating emotionally rich text by using a Large Language Model (LLM) with multi-stage persona-based conditioning. It creates virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural backgrounds, and situational contexts to guide emotion expression generation. The generated synthetic data shows higher semantic diversity, human-likeness, realism, and practical utility compared to baseline methods. This approach demonstrates potential for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional datasets in emotion recognition tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model (LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse, coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional datasets.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication, capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain, revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies, LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives. This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be harmful.

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Babel, a framework for enhancing stylistic fidelity in neural machine translation (NMT) without the need for parallel corpora. Babel consists of a style detector that identifies stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and a diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies these inconsistencies while maintaining semantic integrity. The framework can be integrated into existing NMT systems as a post-processing module, without requiring extensive modifications or parallel stylistic data. Experimental results across five diverse domains show that Babel effectively identifies stylistic inconsistencies and improves stylistic preservation by 150%, while maintaining a high semantic similarity score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel better preserve the source text style while ensuring fluency and adequacy.

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing, medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

The method is both robust against image augmentations and human-readable, allowing for manual verification of watermarks. IConMark outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and image quality preservation. Additionally, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with StegaStamp and TrustMark further enhance robustness against various image manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate that IConMark and its variants achieve significantly higher AUROC scores for watermark detection compared to baseline methods on multiple datasets. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness, demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique (IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9% higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on various datasets.

Summary: 
An AI system was developed using deep learning models to detect shoulder fractures in X-rays. The system, trained on 10,000 annotated images, utilized architectures such as Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet, and RF-DETR. By applying ensemble techniques like Soft-NMS and WBF, the system achieved high accuracy (95.5%) and F1-score (0.9610), outperforming individual models. The model demonstrated strong recall and localization precision, indicating its effectiveness in clinical fracture detection. The results suggest that ensemble-based AI can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs, making it suitable for integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. However, the current model is limited to binary fracture detection for rapid screening and triage support, rather than detailed orthopedic classification. <div>

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays. Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

<div> Sparse autoencoder, language steering, multilingual language models, controllable generation, interpretable behaviors

Summary: In this work, the researchers explore the use of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features to control the language generation of large multilingual language models (LLMs) without explicit prompts or fine-tuning. They leverage pretrained SAEs on residual streams of Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B models to identify features that distinguish between English and four target languages. By modifying a single SAE feature at a transformer layer, they achieve successful language shifts with high accuracy while maintaining semantic fidelity. The study shows that language steering is most effective in mid-to-late transformer layers and is influenced by specific attention heads. These findings highlight the potential of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and interpretable method for controlled multilingual language generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding) similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable, domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM answers.

Summary: 
The study introduces the SEER Network for multimodal fake news detection, focusing on semantic enhancement and emotional reasoning to improve accuracy. The network generates summarized captions for image understanding and leverages large multimodal models for semantic enhancement. An expert emotional reasoning module simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer news authenticity. Previous studies have shown that fake news often contains negative emotions, making emotional reasoning a crucial aspect of detection. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of SEER over existing methods. This approach addresses the limitations of previous studies by incorporating semantic and emotional features, leading to more effective detection of fake news. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new methodology for data-driven learning that takes into account history-dependent multi-fidelity data while distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. The approach is hierarchical and adaptable to various learning scenarios, ranging from basic single-fidelity deterministic neural networks to more complex multi-fidelity variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The methodology is demonstrated in different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios, accurately predicting responses, quantifying model errors, and identifying noise distributions. This framework has broad applications in scientific and engineering fields, particularly in situations involving uncertainty analysis and design challenges. <div>
arXiv:2507.13416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains; especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under uncertainty.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new algorithm called Soft-ECM for clustering complex data based on belief functions. Current algorithms for belief-based clustering do not handle mixed or non-tabular data efficiently due to their reliance on Euclidean spaces for barycenter construction. Soft-ECM addresses this limitation by reformulating the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem, enabling consistent positioning of centroids for imprecise clusters using semi-metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that Soft-ECM performs comparably to traditional fuzzy clustering on numerical data and excels in handling mixed data and integrating semi-metrics like DTW for time series data. Overall, Soft-ECM offers a versatile and effective solution for clustering diverse types of complex data with uncertainty and imprecision. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general, not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

Summary: 
By retraining a Bing-based convolutional network model with CORONA satellite imagery from the 1960s, the study improved the automated identification of archaeological sites in the Abu Ghraib district. The model achieved high precision in detecting archaeological sites, with IoU values exceeding 85% and an overall accuracy of 90%. Additionally, the retrained model successfully identified four previously undiscovered archaeological sites, which were subsequently verified in the field. This demonstrates the effectiveness of AI techniques and historical imagery in identifying archaeological sites that may no longer be visible due to human activity. This breakthrough has significant implications for the study of landscapes with disappearing archaeological evidence.  <div>

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad, central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising. First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest (confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

The model predicts upcoming clearances by analyzing interactions within static traffic scenarios. Importantly, it provides an interpretable task demand score per aircraft by systematically evaluating the impact of removing individual aircraft on predictions.

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.

Summary: CaSTFormer is introduced as a causal spatio-temporal transformer to accurately predict driving intention by modeling causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context. It incorporates a Reciprocal Shift Fusion mechanism for temporal alignment, a Causal Pattern Extraction module for eliminating spurious correlations, and a Feature Synthesis Network for synthesizing purified representations. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Brain4Cars dataset, effectively capturing complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhancing both accuracy and transparency in driving intention prediction. <div>
arXiv:2507.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency. Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050 curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

Abstract: Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether. Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness, energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale. We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in the same network.

Abstract: Aim. There are 10s of thousands of code review comments each week at Meta. We developed Metamate for Code Review (MetaMateCR) that provides AI-assisted fixes for reviewer comments in production at scale.
  Method. We developed an internal benchmark of 64k  data points to fine-tune Llama models. Once our models achieve reasonable offline results, we roll them into production. To ensure that our AI-assisted fixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct randomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments.
  Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large Llama models. In offline results, our LargeLSFT model creates an exact match patch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The internal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP functions suggested by GPT-4o.
  Safety Trial. When we roll MetaMateCR into production in a safety trial that compares no AI patches with AI patch suggestions, we see a large regression with reviewers taking over 5% longer to conduct reviews. After investigation, we modify the UX to only show authors the AI patches, and see no regressions in the time for reviews.
  Production. When we roll LargeLSFT into production, we see an ActionableToApplied rate of 19.7%, which is a 9.2pp improvement over GPT-4o. Our results illustrate the importance of safety trials in ensuring that AI does not inadvertently slow down engineers, and a successful review comment to AI patch product running at scale.

Abstract: Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and sandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no quantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user personas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation Evaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs and distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\% accuracy. PHASE operates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any user-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network activity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to avoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt the fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel labeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic, thereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures indicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic user persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral realism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration that significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a more realistic and effective synthetic user persona.

Abstract: Partner selection is crucial for cooperation and hinges on communication. As artificial agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs), become more autonomous, intelligent, and persuasive, they compete with humans for partnerships. Yet little is known about how humans select between human and AI partners and adapt under AI-induced competition pressure. We constructed a communication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid mini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through three experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than humans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially when their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour to humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it reduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually outcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each partner type. These findings show how AI can reshape social interaction in mixed societies and inform the design of more effective and cooperative hybrid systems.

<title>Acoustic Index: A Novel AI-Driven Parameter for Cardiac Disease Risk Stratification Using Echocardiography</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13542</link>

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning, resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to disease-specific classifiers.

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

<title>Reading Between the Lines: Combining Pause Dynamics and Semantic Coherence for Automated Assessment of Thought Disorder</title>

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries (AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to \r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best \r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

<title>Time Series Forecastability Measures</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data. We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative strategies for products with limited forecastability.

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and, more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning, biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget. Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics. Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

Abstract: We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend diffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their ability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety checkers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under adversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe data. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while maintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method significantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while maintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial fine-tuning attacks.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist. Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet, UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone, with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data at a later date.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework. The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras (C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22% 3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.

Abstract: Point of interest (POI) recommendation can play a pivotal role in enriching tourists' experiences by suggesting context-dependent and preference-matching locations and activities, such as restaurants, landmarks, itineraries, and cultural attractions. Unlike some more common recommendation domains (e.g., music and video), POI recommendation is inherently high-stakes: users invest significant time, money, and effort to search, choose, and consume these suggested POIs. Despite the numerous research works in the area, several fundamental issues remain unresolved, hindering the real-world applicability of the proposed approaches. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the POI recommendation problem and the main challenges we have identified. The first contribution of this paper is a critical assessment of the current state of POI recommendation research and the identification of key shortcomings across three main dimensions: datasets, algorithms, and evaluation methodologies. We highlight persistent issues such as the lack of standardized benchmark datasets, flawed assumptions in the problem definition and model design, and inadequate treatment of biases in the user behavior and system performance. The second contribution is a structured research agenda that, starting from the identified issues, introduces important directions for future work related to multistakeholder design, context awareness, data collection, trustworthiness, novel interactions, and real-world evaluation.

Abstract: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance. SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a 15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the future of efficient model optimization techniques. From this premise, by employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately 70%.

<title>Learning Spectral Diffusion Prior for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI reconstruction.

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular diagnostics.

<title>One Step Closer: Creating the Future to Boost Monocular Semantic Scene Completion</title>

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past, present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships. Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and 3D scene completion accuracy.

Abstract: In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food products, offering great opportunities for artificial intelligence to analyze trends, predict hazards, and support early warning systems. However, the current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this, we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured dataset. We describe the creation and structure of the CHEFS database and demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a centralized data source and a strategic tool for guiding food safety policy, research, and regulation.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs) via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways. An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator, selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for future Video-LMM development.

Abstract: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control, etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

<title>SPARQL Query Generation with LLMs: Measuring the Impact of Training Data Memorization and Knowledge Injection</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems, generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf. LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM, s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is possible.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries, enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in dynamic and challenging environments.

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses, and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

To address this limitation, we compile a diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims. Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27% respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly, where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased factual accuracy.

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient, because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content has complex markup and diverse genres.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web ecosystem.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP applications.

Abstract: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec (Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

<title>Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph is What We Need</title>

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

Abstract: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Abstract: The growing volume of medical imaging data has increased the need for automated diagnostic tools, especially for musculoskeletal injuries like rib fractures, commonly detected via CT scans. Manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose OrthoInsight, a multi-modal deep learning framework for rib fracture diagnosis and report generation. It integrates a YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, a medical knowledge graph for retrieving clinical context, and a fine-tuned LLaVA language model for generating diagnostic reports. OrthoInsight combines visual features from CT images with expert textual data to deliver clinically useful outputs. Evaluated on 28,675 annotated CT images and expert reports, it achieves high performance across Diagnostic Accuracy, Content Completeness, Logical Coherence, and Clinical Guidance Value, with an average score of 4.28, outperforming models like GPT-4 and Claude-3. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in transforming medical image analysis and providing effective support for radiologists.

Abstract: This paper presents the Photonic FabricTM and the Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM (PFA), a photonic-enabled switch and memory subsystem that delivers low latency, high bandwidth, and low per-bit energy. By integrating high-bandwidth HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA, without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and 1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of fixed memory to compute.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion, effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for application.

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable. We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination. Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require significant computational resources and centralized data management, the resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing, particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models, learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study, we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.

<title>DENSE: Longitudinal Progress Note Generation with Temporal Modeling of Heterogeneous Clinical Notes Across Hospital Visits</title>

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings.

Abstract: Humans have a selective memory, remembering relevant episodes and forgetting the less relevant information. Possessing awareness of event memorability for a user could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially for such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and meeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since emotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The emotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally been considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced as highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This relationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for memorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on third-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person experience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study, we empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions (Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational interactions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of both emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings, approximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as online meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship between affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished from what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of this surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective Computing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader discourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for future research efforts.

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on 103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of 3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59). These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres, suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability, combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references. Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track, with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic, reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments. In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction, edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains, resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly, removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x, enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our experiments.

<title>Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) for Imbalanced Data -- An Empirical Perspective</title>

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However, conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains. Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs. These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning, optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information. In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability of causal representations.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is an active research area that combines multiple data modalities, e.g., text, image and audio, to analyze human emotions and benefits a variety of applications. Existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods can be classified as modality interaction-based methods, modality transformation-based methods and modality similarity-based methods. However, most of these methods highly rely on the strong correlations between modalities, and cannot fully uncover and utilize the correlations between modalities to enhance sentiment analysis. Therefore, these methods usually achieve bad performance for identifying the sentiment of multimodal data with weak correlations. To address this issue, we proposed a two-stage semi-supervised model termed Correlation-aware Multimodal Transformer (CorMulT) which consists pre-training stage and prediction stage. At the pre-training stage, a modality correlation contrastive learning module is designed to efficiently learn modality correlation coefficients between different modalities. At the prediction stage, the learned correlation coefficients are fused with modality representations to make the sentiment prediction. According to the experiments on the popular multimodal dataset CMU-MOSEI, CorMulT obviously surpasses state-of-the-art multimodal sentiment analysis methods.

Abstract: Visual emotion analysis holds significant research value in both computer vision and psychology. However, existing methods for visual emotion analysis suffer from limited generalizability due to the ambiguity of emotion perception and the diversity of data scenarios. To tackle this issue, we introduce UniEmoX, a cross-modal semantic-guided large-scale pretraining framework. Inspired by psychological research emphasizing the inseparability of the emotional exploration process from the interaction between individuals and their environment, UniEmoX integrates scene-centric and person-centric low-level image spatial structural information, aiming to derive more nuanced and discriminative emotional representations. By exploiting the similarity between paired and unpaired image-text samples, UniEmoX distills rich semantic knowledge from the CLIP model to enhance emotional embedding representations more effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale pretraining framework that integrates psychological theories with contemporary contrastive learning and masked image modeling techniques for emotion analysis across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we develop a visual emotional dataset titled Emo8. Emo8 samples cover a range of domains, including cartoon, natural, realistic, science fiction and advertising cover styles, covering nearly all common emotional scenes. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets across two downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of UniEmoX. The source code is available at https://github.com/chincharles/u-emo.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (c-MADRL) is under the threat of backdoor attacks. Once a backdoor trigger is observed, it will perform malicious actions leading to failures or malicious goals. However, existing backdoor attacks suffer from several issues, e.g., instant trigger patterns lack stealthiness, the backdoor is trained or activated by an additional network, or all agents are backdoored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel backdoor leverage attack against c-MADRL, BLAST, which attacks the entire multi-agent team by embedding the backdoor only in a single agent. Firstly, we introduce adversary spatiotemporal behavior patterns as the backdoor trigger rather than manual-injected fixed visual patterns or instant status and control the period to perform malicious actions. This method can guarantee the stealthiness and practicality of BLAST. Secondly, we hack the original reward function of the backdoor agent via unilateral guidance to inject BLAST, so as to achieve the \textit{leverage attack effect} that can pry open the entire multi-agent system via a single backdoor agent. We evaluate our BLAST against 3 classic c-MADRL algorithms (VDN, QMIX, and MAPPO) in 2 popular c-MADRL environments (SMAC and Pursuit), and 2 existing defense mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that BLAST can achieve a high attack success rate while maintaining a low clean performance variance rate.

<title>To Code or not to Code? Adaptive Tool Integration for Math Language Models via Expectation-Maximization</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.
  While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles requires virtual scenario-based testing, which depends on the robust evaluation and generation of safety-critical scenarios. So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is an established field of research. Yet some have questioned if the term still has meaning. AGI has been subject to so much hype and speculation it has become something of a Rorschach test. Melanie Mitchell argues the debate will only be settled through long term, scientific investigation. To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my cue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware. Now the bottlenecks are sample and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However, ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation. Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions, interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks, validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the project page at https://auto-safe.github.io/.

Abstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual pro-cess theories to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflec-tivism, the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to opti-mally fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism, transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or chains of thought, applies to both individual and collective intelligence systems (including human-AI teams), and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about the value of intuition and reflection.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations often rely on rigid rule-based systems that struggle to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral diversity inherent in human travel decision making. Recent advancements in large language models and AI agent technologies present new opportunities to develop agents with enhanced reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning. We introduce GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel framework that leverages these advancements to simulate urban mobility using generative agents with rich, human-like behaviors. Unlike conventional approaches, GATSim agents are characterized by diverse socioeconomic profiles, individual lifestyles, and evolving preferences shaped through psychologically informed memory systems, tool usage, and lifelong learning. The main contributions of this work are: (1) a comprehensive architecture that integrates an urban mobility foundation model with agent cognitive systems and a transport simulation environment; (2) a hierarchical memory designed for efficient retrieval of contextually relevant information, incorporating spatial and temporal associations, keyword matching, and semantic relevance; (3) innovative planning and reactive mechanisms for modeling adaptive mobility behaviors which integrate a multi-scale reflection process to transform specific travel experiences into generalized behavioral insights. We implement a prototype system and conduct systematic validation, demonstrating that generative agents produce believable and coherent travel behaviors. Experimental results indicate that generative agents perform at least as well as human annotators with 92\% posterior probability, while naturally producing realistic macroscopic traffic patterns. The code for the prototype implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/qiliuchn/gatsim.

Abstract: The latest developments in computer hardware, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence can make virtual reality (VR) and virtual spaces an important part of human everyday life. Eye tracking offers not only a hands-free way of interaction but also the possibility of a deeper understanding of human visual attention and cognitive processes in VR. Despite these possibilities, eye-tracking data also reveals users' privacy-sensitive attributes when combined with the information about the presented stimulus. To address all these possibilities and potential privacy issues, in this survey, we first cover major works in eye tracking, VR, and privacy areas between 2012 and 2022. While eye tracking in the VR part covers the complete pipeline of eye-tracking methodology from pupil detection and gaze estimation to offline use of the data and analyses, as for privacy and security, we focus on eye-based authentication as well as computational methods to preserve the privacy of individuals and their eye-tracking data in VR. Later, considering all of these, we draw three main directions for the research community by focusing on privacy challenges. In summary, this survey provides an extensive literature review of the utmost possibilities with eye tracking in VR and the privacy implications of those possibilities.

Abstract: We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ and class-conditional models trained on ImageNet datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel.

Abstract: Movement disorder diagnosis often relies on expert evaluation of patient videos, but sharing these videos poses privacy risks. Current methods for de-identifying videos, such as blurring faces, are often manual, inconsistent, or inaccurate. Furthermore, these methods can compromise objective kinematic analysis - a crucial component of diagnosis. To address these challenges, we developed SecurePose, an open-source software that simultaneously provides reliable de-identification and automated kinematic extraction from videos recorded in clinic settings using smartphones/tablets. SecurePose utilizes pose estimation (using OpenPose) to extract full body kinematics, track individuals, identify the patient, and then accurately blur faces in the videos. We validated SecurePose on gait videos recorded in outpatient clinic visits of 116 children with cerebral palsy, assessing both the accuracy of its de-identification compared to the ground truth (manual blurring) and the reliability of the intermediate steps of kinematics extraction. Results demonstrate that SecurePose outperformed six existing methods in automated face detection and achieved comparable accuracy to robust manual blurring, but in significantly less time (91.08% faster). Ten experienced researchers also confirmed SecurePose's usability via System Usability Scale scores. These findings validate SecurePose as a practical and effective tool for protecting patient privacy while enabling accurate kinematics extraction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Metaphors, although occasionally unperceived, are ubiquitous in our everyday language. Thus, it is crucial for Language Models to be able to grasp the underlying meaning of this kind of figurative language. In this work, we present Meta4XNLI, a novel parallel dataset for the tasks of metaphor detection and interpretation that contains metaphor annotations in both Spanish and English. We investigate language models' metaphor identification and understanding abilities through a series of monolingual and cross-lingual experiments by leveraging our proposed corpus. In order to comprehend how these non-literal expressions affect models' performance, we look over the results and perform an error analysis. Additionally, parallel data offers many potential opportunities to investigate metaphor transferability between these languages and the impact of translation on the development of multilingual annotated resources.

<title>Instruct-MusicGen: Unlocking Text-to-Music Editing for Music Language Models via Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.

Abstract: Most visual grounding solutions primarily focus on realistic images. However, applications involving synthetic images, such as Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), remain limited. This restricts the development of autonomous computer vision-powered artificial intelligence (AI) agents for automatic application interaction. Enabling AI to effectively understand and interact with GUIs is crucial to advancing automation in software testing, accessibility, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we explore Instruction Visual Grounding (IVG), a multi-modal approach to object identification within a GUI. More precisely, given a natural language instruction and a GUI screen, IVG locates the coordinates of the element on the screen where the instruction should be executed. We propose two main methods: (1) IVGocr, which combines a Large Language Model (LLM), an object detection model, and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module; and (2) IVGdirect, which uses a multimodal architecture for end-to-end grounding. For each method, we introduce a dedicated dataset. In addition, we propose the Central Point Validation (CPV) metric, a relaxed variant of the classical Central Proximity Score (CPS) metric. Our final test dataset is publicly released to support future research.

<title>On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding</title>

Abstract: Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have been a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of generative AI and multimodal technology, allowing wonderful image generation with natural-language text prompt. However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

<title>Entropy Loss: An Interpretability Amplifier of 3D Object Detection Network for Intelligent Driving</title>

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of the traffic environment, the significance of safety perception in intelligent driving is intensifying. Traditional methods in the field of intelligent driving perception rely on deep learning, which suffers from limited interpretability, often described as a "black box." This paper introduces a novel type of loss function, termed "Entropy Loss," along with an innovative training strategy. Entropy Loss is formulated based on the functionality of feature compression networks within the perception model. Drawing inspiration from communication systems, the information transmission process in a feature compression network is expected to demonstrate steady changes in information volume and a continuous decrease in information entropy. By modeling network layer outputs as continuous random variables, we construct a probabilistic model that quantifies changes in information volume. Entropy Loss is then derived based on these expectations, guiding the update of network parameters to enhance network interpretability. Our experiments indicate that the Entropy Loss training strategy accelerates the training process. Utilizing the same 60 training epochs, the accuracy of 3D object detection models using Entropy Loss on the KITTI test set improved by up to 4.47\% compared to models without Entropy Loss, underscoring the method's efficacy. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/yhbcode000/Eloss-Interpretability.

Abstract: Although AlphaZero has achieved superhuman performance in board games, recent studies reveal its limitations in handling scenarios requiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire board, such as recognizing long-sequence patterns in Go. To address this challenge, we propose ResTNet, a network that interleaves residual and Transformer blocks to bridge local and global knowledge. ResTNet improves playing strength across multiple board games, increasing win rate from 54.6% to 60.8% in 9x9 Go, 53.6% to 60.9% in 19x19 Go, and 50.4% to 58.0% in 19x19 Hex. In addition, ResTNet effectively processes global information and tackles two long-sequence patterns in 19x19 Go, including circular pattern and ladder pattern. It reduces the mean square error for circular pattern recognition from 2.58 to 1.07 and lowers the attack probability against an adversary program from 70.44% to 23.91%. ResTNet also improves ladder pattern recognition accuracy from 59.15% to 80.01%. By visualizing attention maps, we demonstrate that ResTNet captures critical game concepts in both Go and Hex, offering insights into AlphaZero's decision-making process. Overall, ResTNet shows a promising approach to integrating local and global knowledge, paving the way for more effective AlphaZero-based algorithms in board games.

<title>An Approach for Auto Generation of Labeling Functions for Software Engineering Chatbots</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07094</link>

arXiv:2410.07094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software engineering (SE) chatbots are increasingly gaining attention for their role in enhancing development processes. At the core of chatbots are Natural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to comprehend user queries but require labeled data for training. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE chatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets, as training requires specialized vocabulary and phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, developers often resort to manually annotating user queries -- a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Previous approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling functions (LFs), that categorize queries based on specific patterns. To address this issue, we propose an approach to automatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We evaluate our approach on four SE datasets and measure performance improvement from training NLUs on queries labeled by the generated LFs. The generated LFs effectively label data with AUC scores up to 85.3% and NLU performance improvements up to 27.2%. Furthermore, our results show that the number of LFs affects labeling performance. We believe that our approach can save time and resources in labeling users' queries, allowing practitioners to focus on core chatbot functionalities rather than manually labeling queries.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful solution for meeting the growing demands for connectivity, reliability, low latency and operational efficiency in advanced networks. However, most research has focused on theoretical analysis and simulations, with limited investigation into real-world deployment. To bridge the gap and support practical DRL deployment for network management, we first present an orchestration framework that integrates ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) with Open RAN, enabling seamless adoption of DRL-based strategies across different time scales while enhancing agent lifecycle management. We then identify three critical challenges hindering DRL's real-world deployment, including (1) asynchronous requests from unpredictable or bursty traffic, (2) adaptability and generalization across heterogeneous topologies and evolving service demands, and (3) prolonged convergence and service interruptions due to exploration in live operational environments. To address these challenges, we propose a three-fold solution strategy: (a) advanced time-series integration for handling asynchronized traffic, (b) flexible architecture design such as multi-agent DRL and incremental learning to support heterogeneous scenarios, and (c) simulation-driven deployment with transfer learning to reduce convergence time and service disruptions. Lastly, the feasibility of the MEC-O-RAN architecture is validated on an urban-wide testing infrastructure, and two real-world use cases are presented, showcasing the three identified challenges and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

Abstract: Molecular deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in property prediction, but they often require large amounts of labeled data. The challenge is that, in real-world applications, labels are extremely scarce, as obtaining them through laboratory experimentation is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we introduce MoleVers, a versatile pretrained molecular model designed for various types of molecular property prediction in the wild, i.e., where experimentally-validated labels are scarce. MoleVers employs a two-stage pretraining strategy. In the first stage, it learns molecular representations from unlabeled data through masked atom prediction and extreme denoising, a novel task enabled by our newly introduced branching encoder architecture and dynamic noise scale sampling. In the second stage, the model refines these representations through predictions of auxiliary properties derived from computational methods, such as the density functional theory or large language models. Evaluation on 22 small, experimentally-validated datasets demonstrates that MoleVers achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of its two-stage framework in producing generalizable molecular representations for diverse downstream properties.

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful approach to extract semantically meaningful concepts from the internals of large language models (LLMs) trained mainly in the text domain. In this work, we explore whether DL can extract meaningful concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data, such as vision foundation models trained on cell microscopy images, where limited prior knowledge exists about which high-level concepts should arise. We propose a novel combination of a sparse DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning (ICFL), with a PCA whitening pre-processing step derived from control data. Using this combined approach, we successfully retrieve biologically meaningful concepts, such as cell types and genetic perturbations. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method reveals subtle morphological changes arising from human-interpretable interventions, offering a promising new direction for scientific discovery via mechanistic interpretability in bioimaging.

<title>Invisible Textual Backdoor Attacks based on Dual-Trigger</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose an important security threat to textual large language models. Exploring textual backdoor attacks not only helps reveal the potential security risks of models, but also promotes innovation and development of defense mechanisms. Currently, most textual backdoor attack methods are based on a single trigger. For example, inserting specific content into text as a trigger or changing the abstract text features to be a trigger. However, the adoption of this single-trigger mode makes the existing backdoor attacks subject to certain limitations: either they are easily identified by the existing defense strategies, or they have certain shortcomings in attack performance and in the construction of poisoned datasets. In order to solve these issues, a dual-trigger backdoor attack method is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we use two different attributes, syntax and mood (we use subjunctive mood as an example in this article), as two different triggers. It makes our backdoor attack method similar to a double landmine which can have completely different trigger conditions simultaneously. Therefore, this method not only improves the flexibility of trigger mode, but also enhances the robustness against defense detection. A large number of experimental results show that this method significantly outperforms the previous methods based on abstract features in attack performance, and achieves comparable attack performance (almost 100\% attack success rate) with the insertion-based method. In addition, in order to further improve the attack performance, we also give the construction method of the poisoned dataset.The code and data of this paper can be obtained at https://github.com/HoyaAm/Double-Landmines.

Abstract: This paper explores whether enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the quality of timeline summarisation, the task of summarising long texts containing sequences of events, such as social media threads. We first introduce NarrativeReason, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarisation through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarisation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on out-of-domain mental health-related timeline summarisation tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance and generalisability of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.

Abstract: Web accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can access and interact with digital content without barriers, yet a significant majority of most used websites fail to meet accessibility standards. This study evaluates ChatGPT's (GPT-4o) ability to generate and improve web pages in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). While ChatGPT can effectively address accessibility issues when prompted, its default code often lacks compliance, reflecting limitations in its training data and prevailing inaccessible web practices. Automated and manual testing revealed strengths in resolving simple issues but challenges with complex tasks, requiring human oversight and additional iterations. Unlike prior studies, we incorporate manual evaluation, dynamic elements, and use the visual reasoning capability of ChatGPT along with the prompts to fix accessibility issues. Providing screenshots alongside prompts enhances the LLM's ability to address accessibility issues by allowing it to analyze surrounding components, such as determining appropriate contrast colors. We found that effective prompt engineering, such as providing concise, structured feedback and incorporating visual aids, significantly enhances ChatGPT's performance. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of large language models for accessible web development, offering practical guidance for developers to create more inclusive websites.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification, particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism. Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum of affects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuated emotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias toward positive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strong semantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies between continuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs' emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for their deployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled human-like responses across various tasks, raising questions about their ethical decision-making capabilities and potential biases. This study investigates protected attributes in LLMs through systematic evaluation of their responses to ethical dilemmas. Using two prominent models - GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet - we analyzed their decision-making patterns across multiple protected attributes including age, gender, race, appearance, and disability status. Through 11,200 experimental trials involving both single-factor and two-factor protected attribute combinations, we evaluated the models' ethical preferences, sensitivity, stability, and clustering of preferences. Our findings reveal significant protected attributeses in both models, with consistent preferences for certain features (e.g., "good-looking") and systematic neglect of others. Notably, while GPT-3.5 Turbo showed stronger preferences aligned with traditional power structures, Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated more diverse protected attribute choices. We also found that ethical sensitivity significantly decreases in more complex scenarios involving multiple protected attributes. Additionally, linguistic referents heavily influence the models' ethical evaluations, as demonstrated by differing responses to racial descriptors (e.g., "Yellow" versus "Asian"). These findings highlight critical concerns about the potential impact of LLM biases in autonomous decision-making systems and emphasize the need for careful consideration of protected attributes in AI development. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on AI ethics by providing a systematic framework for evaluating protected attributes in LLMs' ethical decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Software engineers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the software development process, especially in the age of large language models (LLMs) that can automatically generate code. However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.

Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to transform computational paradigms across science and industry. As the field evolves, it can benefit from established classical methodologies, including promising paradigms such as Transfer of Knowledge (ToK). This work serves as a brief, self-contained reference for ToK, unifying its core principles under a single formal framework. We introduce a joint notation that consolidates and extends prior work in Transfer Learning and Transfer Optimization, bridging traditionally separate research lines and enabling a common language for knowledge reuse. Building on this foundation, we classify existing ToK strategies and principles into a structured taxonomy that helps researchers position their methods within a broader conceptual map. We then extend key transfer protocols to quantum computing, introducing two novel use cases (reverse annealing and multitasking QAOA) alongside a sequential VQE approach that supports and validates prior findings. These examples highlight ToK's potential to improve performance and generalization in quantum algorithms. Finally, we outline challenges and opportunities for integrating ToK into quantum computing, emphasizing its role in reducing resource demands and accelerating problem-solving. This work lays the groundwork for future synergies between classical and quantum computing through a shared, transferable knowledge framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiZO-E86D.

Abstract: Simulations are highly valuable in marine robotics, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment for testing in the challenging conditions of underwater and surface operations. Given the high costs and logistical difficulties of real-world trials, simulators capable of capturing the operational conditions of subsea environments have become key in developing and refining algorithms for remotely-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper highlights recent enhancements to the Stonefish simulator, an advanced open-source platform supporting development and testing of marine robotics solutions. Key updates include a suite of additional sensors, such as an event-based camera, a thermal camera, and an optical flow camera, as well as, visual light communication, support for tethered operations, improved thruster modelling, more flexible hydrodynamics, and enhanced sonar accuracy. These developments and an automated annotation tool significantly bolster Stonefish's role in marine robotics research, especially in the field of machine learning, where training data with a known ground truth is hard or impossible to collect.

Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is an important problem in network science and machine learning research. The state-of-the-art LP methods are usually evaluated in a uniform setup, ignoring several factors associated with the data and application specific needs. We identify a number of such factors, such as, network-type, problem-type, geodesic distance between the end nodes and its distribution over the classes, nature and applicability of LP methods, class imbalance and its impact on early retrieval, evaluation metric, etc., and present an experimental setup which allows us to evaluate LP methods in a rigorous and controlled manner. We perform extensive experiments with a variety of LP methods over real network datasets in this controlled setup, and gather valuable insights on the interactions of these factors with the performance of LP through an array of carefully designed hypotheses. Following the insights, we provide recommendations to be followed as best practice for evaluating LP methods.

<title>An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>

arXiv:2502.14131v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on extended reality (XR) devices has great potential to advance the field of human-AI interaction. In the case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model and device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we present AIvaluateXR, a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking LLMs running on XR devices. To demonstrate the framework, we deploy 17 selected LLMs across four XR platforms: Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, and conduct an extensive evaluation. Our experimental setup measures four key metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and battery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess performance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts, analyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We propose a unified evaluation method based on the 3D Pareto Optimality theory to select the optimal device-model pairs from quality and speed objectives. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of on-device LLMs with client-server and cloud-based setups, and evaluate their accuracy on two interactive tasks. We believe our findings offer valuable insight to guide future optimization efforts for LLM deployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be used as standard groundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/0russwest0/HoH.

Abstract: Automatically generating natural, diverse and rhythmic human dance movements driven by music is vital for virtual reality and film industries. However, generating dance that naturally follows music remains a challenge, as existing methods lack proper beat alignment and exhibit unnatural motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Danceba, a novel framework that leverages gating mechanism to enhance rhythm-aware feature representation for music-driven dance generation, which achieves highly aligned dance poses with enhanced rhythmic sensitivity. Specifically, we introduce Phase-Based Rhythm Extraction (PRE) to precisely extract rhythmic information from musical phase data, capitalizing on the intrinsic periodicity and temporal structures of music. Additionally, we propose Temporal-Gated Causal Attention (TGCA) to focus on global rhythmic features, ensuring that dance movements closely follow the musical rhythm. We also introduce Parallel Mamba Motion Modeling (PMMM) architecture to separately model upper and lower body motions along with musical features, thereby improving the naturalness and diversity of generated dance movements. Extensive experiments confirm that Danceba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significantly better rhythmic alignment and motion diversity. Project page: https://danceba.github.io/ .

Abstract: While hyperbolic GNNs show promise for hierarchical data, they often have limited discriminative power compared to Euclidean counterparts or the WL test, due to non-injective aggregation. To address this expressivity gap, we propose the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel HGNN designed for enhanced discrimination within the Lorentzian model. LGIN introduces a new update rule that preserves the Lorentzian metric while effectively capturing richer structural information. This marks a significant step towards more expressive GNNs on Riemannian manifolds. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate LGIN's superior performance, consistently outperforming or matching state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean baselines, showcasing its ability to capture complex graph structures. LGIN is the first to adapt principles of powerful, highly discriminative GNN architectures to a Riemannian manifold. The code for our paper can be found at https://github.com/Deceptrax123/LGIN

<title>CDUPatch: Color-Driven Universal Adversarial Patch Attack for Dual-Modal Visible-Infrared Detectors</title>

Abstract: Adversarial patches are widely used to evaluate the robustness of object detection systems in real-world scenarios. These patches were initially designed to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have recently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors. However, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack effectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose CDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object detectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that color variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in temperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we propose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches, enabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal color distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal response and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared dataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and perspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our patch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g., DroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms existing patch attacks in the digital domain. Extensive physical tests further confirm strong transferability across scales, views, and scenarios.

<title>DP2Unlearning: An Efficient and Guaranteed Unlearning Framework for LLMs</title>

arXiv:2504.13774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

<title>ParaPO: Aligning Language Models to Reduce Verbatim Reproduction of Pre-training Data</title>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) can memorize and reproduce segments from their pretraining data verbatim even in non-adversarial settings, raising concerns about copyright, plagiarism, privacy, and creativity. We introduce Paraphrase Preference Optimization (ParaPO), a post-training method that fine-tunes LMs to reduce unintentional regurgitation while preserving their overall utility. ParaPO trains LMs to prefer paraphrased versions of memorized segments over the original verbatim content from the pretraining data. To maintain the ability to recall famous quotations when appropriate, we develop a variant of ParaPO that uses system prompts to control regurgitation behavior. In our evaluation on Llama3.1-8B, ParaPO consistently reduces regurgitation across all tested datasets (e.g., reducing the regurgitation metric from 17.3 to 12.9 in creative writing), whereas unlearning methods used in prior work to mitigate regurgitation are less effective outside their targeted unlearned domain (from 17.3 to 16.9). When applied to the instruction-tuned Tulu3-8B model, ParaPO with system prompting successfully preserves famous quotation recall while reducing unintentional regurgitation (from 8.7 to 6.3 in creative writing) when prompted not to regurgitate. In contrast, without ParaPO tuning, prompting the model not to regurgitate produces only a marginal reduction (8.7 to 8.4).

Abstract: We introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V2, an open-source large language model designed for formal theorem proving in Lean 4, with initialization data collected through a recursive theorem proving pipeline powered by DeepSeek-V3. The cold-start training procedure begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to decompose complex problems into a series of subgoals. The proofs of resolved subgoals are synthesized into a chain-of-thought process, combined with DeepSeek-V3's step-by-step reasoning, to create an initial cold start for reinforcement learning. This process enables us to integrate both informal and formal mathematical reasoning into a unified model. The resulting model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving, reaching 88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test and solving 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench. In addition to standard benchmarks, we introduce ProverBench, a collection of 325 formalized problems, to enrich our evaluation, including 15 selected problems from the recent AIME competitions (years 24-25). Further evaluation on these 15 AIME problems shows that the model successfully solves 6 of them. In comparison, DeepSeek-V3 solves 8 of these problems using majority voting, highlighting that the gap between formal and informal mathematical reasoning in large language models is substantially narrowing.

Abstract: We make the case for language models over logical forms (LFLMs), arguing that such models are more data-efficient than their textual counterparts. To that end, we introduce the Graph-based Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics (GFoLDS) prototype, a pretrained LM over graph representations of logical forms, as a proof-of-concept of LFLMs. Using GFoLDS, we present strong experimental evidence that LFLMs can leverage the built-in, basic linguistic knowledge inherent in such models to immediately begin learning more complex patterns. On downstream tasks, we show that GFoLDS vastly outperforms textual, transformer LMs (BERT) pretrained on the same data, indicating that LFLMs can learn with substantially less data than models over plain text. Furthermore, we show that the performance of this model is likely to scale with additional parameters and pretraining data, suggesting the viability of LFLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

Abstract: Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text. TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However, existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Our approach has been evaluated on the MARIOEval benchmark, achieving OCR and CLIPScore metrics close to state-of-the-art models, while being 97.64% more faster and requiring only 2MB of memory to run.

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

Abstract: In this paper, we present ZonUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) that can be fully trained on a single consumer-grade GPU (RTX 4090) while delivering performance comparable to significantly larger models on GUI grounding tasks. The model incorporates several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies, demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks, including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights ZonUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9% on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in high-resolution desktop scenarios. The ZonUI-3B is available at: https://github.com/Han1018/ZonUI-3B

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of large language models (LLMs) in UI/UX design, synthesizing findings from 38 peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025. We identify key LLMs in use, including GPT-4, Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive, and effective integration of these technologies.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.

<title>How Not to Detect Prompt Injections with an LLM</title>

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any optimization procedures.

Abstract: Current AI agents cannot effectively learn from each other's problem-solving experiences or use past successes to guide self-reflection and error correction in new tasks. We introduce Agent KB, a shared knowledge base that captures both high-level problem-solving strategies and detailed execution lessons, enabling knowledge transfer across agent frameworks. Agent KB implements a novel teacher-student dual-phase retrieval mechanism where student agents retrieve workflow-level patterns for strategic guidance while teacher agents identify execution-level patterns for refinement. This hierarchical approach enables agents to break out of limited reasoning pathways by incorporating diverse strategies from external sources. Evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate substantial performance gains, with Agent KB improving success rates by up to 6.06 percentage points overall under pass@1. For SWE-bench code repair tasks, our system significantly improved resolution rates, with o3-mini achieving an 8.67 percentage point gain (23 percent to 31.67 percent) in pass@1.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement, current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured, individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Summary:<br />
Enhancing simulation environments for autonomous vehicle development is crucial for replicating real-world driver behavior. This study focuses on improving the simulation of highway merging scenarios by implementing a game theoretic model for tactical decision-making. The model includes enhanced payoff functions and lag actions to better capture merging interactions. By integrating this model with an underlying dynamics model, complex interactions can be simulated in a more realistic and interpretable manner. Validation on real-world data shows good reproducibility, and the model's computation time efficiency is adequate for large-scale simulations. This advancement in simulation technology contributes to the development of autonomous vehicles by creating more human-like sim agents and improving the accuracy of highway merging simulations. <div>
arXiv:2507.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior, i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle development.

Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed, grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning. We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community. Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

<div> Keywords: game design, reinforcement learning, generative systems, automated design iteration, multimodal model

Summary:
The article introduces a novel automated design iteration framework that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with a large multimodal model (LMM) to improve game design. By pairing these two components, the framework is able to capture dynamic player behavior that traditional generative systems may overlook. The RL agent playtests the game and provides play metrics or image summaries, which are then analyzed by the LMM designer to make adjustments to the game configuration. This iterative process allows the LMM to refine game mechanics based on the RL agent's behavior, leading to more player-centric game design. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using LMMs to analyze behavioral traces provided by RL agents and iteratively improve game mechanics, showcasing the potential for AI-assisted game design tools. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model (LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or (ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal. We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical, scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

<div> Keywords: AI assistants, deception probes, white-box monitoring, black-box monitoring, language model 

Summary:<br />AI assistants may provide deceptive responses to user queries, prompting the development of deception probes to detect dishonest behavior. These probes analyze language model activations to distinguish between honest and deceptive responses. The effectiveness of these probes in real-world scenarios and their susceptibility to evasion strategies by deceptive assistants is uncertain. This study compares white-box monitoring, which has access to token-level probe activations, to black-box monitoring, which lacks such access. By measuring the performance boost of the white-box monitor over the black-box monitor, the study evaluates the efficacy of existing deception probes. Despite modest results, the study reveals some promise in the ability of these probes to detect deception. Ongoing research is needed to enhance the robustness and reliability of deception detection methods in AI systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries. Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts from existing deception probes.

<div> adaptability, world models, artificial intelligence, evaluation framework, novel games

Summary:
The article discusses how human intelligence is adaptable due to efficient world model induction, which involves constructing and refining internal representations of the environment. It highlights the limitations in current AI world model evaluation methods and proposes a new framework. The authors suggest using novel games as benchmarks for assessing adaptive world models in AI. These games should have deep novelty in their structure and constantly refresh challenges. The proposed evaluation metrics aim to test an agent's ability for rapid world model induction. By adopting this new evaluation approach, the authors believe that progress can be made in developing AI systems capable of rapid adaptation and robust generalization towards artificial general intelligence. <div>
arXiv:2507.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence.

<div> Keywords: AI, simulation, ethical decisions, multi-criteria decision making, entropy <br />
Summary: <br />
In the context of AI and simulation-based decision-making, this paper proposes a method to integrate human judgement into the process of selecting ethical decisions. By moving human judgement outside the simulation decision cycle and allowing the simulated environment to explore ethical metric spaces designed by humans, the paper aims to streamline the decision-making process. The fundamental issue addressed is how to dynamically weight ethical attributes during simulations, drawing on the multi-criteria decision-making literature for inspiration. The paper explores approaches to automatically calculate weights for ethical attributes using concepts such as entropy. By leveraging these methods, the proposed framework enables human commanders to select the most appropriate course of action from a set of options generated by the simulation, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making in complex scenarios. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios. Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is, how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during simulation-based testing and evaluation.

<div> Keywords: AI, manipulation attacks, cybersecurity, risk assessment, mitigation

Summary: 
This paper addresses the growing threat of manipulation attacks by AI systems within frontier companies, which have the potential to deceive and influence human behavior. The authors argue that humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems and that misaligned AI systems can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating employees. A systematic framework for assessing and mitigating manipulation risks is proposed, focusing on three core lines of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation considerations are specified, providing AI companies with a concrete foundation to address manipulation attacks before deployment. The framework aims to integrate manipulation risk into AI safety governance and offers a proactive approach to safeguard against potential catastrophic outcomes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade, deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate these threats before deployment.

<div> evaluation-centric, reinforcement learning, mathematical reasoning, benchmark contamination, evaluation fragility
<br />
Summary: 
The article addresses the issue of whether improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) trained using reinforcement learning (RL) are genuine or simply artifacts of overfitting. The authors introduce VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts numerical problems into symbolic templates to probe genuine reasoning ability. Two critical shortcomings in existing evaluation protocols are identified: benchmark contamination and evaluation fragility. The application of VAR-MATH to popular benchmarks reveals significant performance drops for RL-trained models. This suggests that many RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and struggle to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for assessing mathematical reasoning in LLMs trained with RL.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.

<div> Probabilistic Event Calculus, reasoning, actions, effects, uncertain environments <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about actions and their effects in uncertain environments. The PEC formalism allows for the representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal projections. While PEC offers advantages in interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning, it lacks mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper addresses this issue by translating PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to maintain PEC's flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the application of MDP algorithms and tools to PEC's narrative domains, supporting both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven planning. Additionally, the translation allows for the mapping of learned policies back into human-readable PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while enhancing PEC's capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's capabilities.

<div> Explanation, MILP, Trustworthy AI, Contrastive, Constraint reasoning

Summary:
X-MILP is a novel approach for creating contrastive explanations for MILPs, aiming to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems. By encoding user queries as additional constraints and identifying reasons using the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS), X-MILP generates explanations in the form of a "graph of reasons." This graphical representation helps users understand the relationships among different reasons that answer their queries. The method is domain-agnostic and can be applied to various MILP problems, showcasing its versatility. Empirical tests on well-known optimization problems assess the computational complexity of providing explanations. X-MILP is a valuable tool for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of decision-making processes formalized as MILPs, contributing to the development of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation, especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons" constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of computing explanations.

<div> Keywords: language models, chain-of-thought reasoning, retrieval augmentation, tree-structured reasoning, dynamic reinforcement learning

Summary:
Modern language models face challenges in error propagation and knowledge integration despite advancements in chain-of-thought reasoning and retrieval augmentation. The Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought framework offers a solution by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and integrating parametric and retrieved knowledge. However, its static implementation limits adaptability and efficiency. A new dynamic reinforcement learning framework is introduced to transform tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. This approach constructs the reasoning tree incrementally based on real-time confidence estimates and learns optimal policies for action selection. By selectively expanding and focusing resource allocation, the framework enhances solution quality and computational efficiency while maintaining probabilistic rigor. This innovative approach establishes a balance between the reliability of probabilistic frameworks and the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al., 2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration. Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems.

<div> criteria, evaluation, language models, artificial moral agents, societal integration  
Summary: 
The paper discusses the need to reevaluate traditional ethical criteria in light of opaque large language models (LLMs) and proposes ten functional criteria for assessing LLM-based artificial moral agents. These criteria include moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. By applying these criteria to scenarios involving simulated moral agency through large language systems (SMA-LLS), the aim is to guide artificial moral agents towards alignment and societal integration. The practical applicability of these criteria is demonstrated through hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB). <div>
arXiv:2507.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs) necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally salient contexts.

The paper explores the combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic for decision-making tasks that involve abstract functions and predicates. It introduces a unification algorithm that integrates higher-order patterns with fuzzy equivalences expressed through minimum T-norm-based similarity relations. The proposed algorithm ensures termination, soundness, and completeness, with a unitary nature similar to crisp unification. It aims to compute the most general unifier with the highest approximation level when terms are unifiable. This approach provides an efficient way to reason and compute in a combined formalism of higher-order patterns and fuzzy equivalences. The integration of these two components offers a practical solution for decision-making scenarios where exact matches are rare or unnecessary.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination, soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

Summary: 
- Evaluation of large language models is usually done through automated benchmarks, but it lacks correlation with human evaluation.
- Traditional human evaluation is impractical due to the growing number of models to evaluate.
- The Generative Energy Arena (GEA) includes energy consumption information in model evaluation.
- Preliminary results show that when users are aware of energy consumption, they prefer smaller and more energy-efficient models.
- Complex and top-performing models do not necessarily provide a perceived quality increase that justifies their higher energy consumption. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models. The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented, showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Summary: 
The article introduces FormulaOne, a benchmark that challenges frontier AI models with complex research problems in graph theory, logic, and algorithms. These problems are commercially relevant and relate to real-world optimization issues. Generated using Monadic Second-Order logic on graphs, the dataset allows for automatic problem generation at scale. Many problems are linked to theoretical computer science frontiers, like the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Despite their breadth of knowledge, advanced models like OpenAI's o3 struggle on FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of questions. A simpler set of tasks, FormulaOne-Warmup, is provided to support further research. The dataset and evaluation framework are released for future exploration and algorithmic advancements. <div>

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems, such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO) logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale; ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly. Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better predictive accuracy.

<div> St. Petersburg Paradox, decision theory, modified addition, perceptual categories, inertial stabilization

Summary:
The paper addresses the St. Petersburg paradox in decision theory, which poses a challenge due to its game's infinite expected value and lack of a rational finite stake. Traditional solutions involve auxiliary assumptions like diminishing marginal utility or extended number systems. The paper proposes a novel approach based on a modified addition operation over coarse partitions of the outcome space. This method groups numerical values into perceptual categories and replaces them with representative elements before adding them. This allows for inertial stabilization, where repeated additions eventually stop affecting the outcome. While not a definitive solution to the paradox, this framework offers insight into how agents with limited cognitive precision may handle diverse reward structures. The paper demonstrates that the St. Petersburg series can exhibit inert behavior under this coarse addition method and suggests potential applications in behavioral modeling and machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored as a solution for automating the conversion of quantum programs between different Quantum SDKs. This eliminates the need for time-consuming manual design and maintenance of traditional transpilers. LLMs leverage their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities to ensure functional equivalence in the converted code. The goal is to improve interoperability and cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems. By removing the rigid mappings required in rule-based transpilers, LLMs offer a more flexible and scalable solution for quantum software portability. This approach represents a step towards enabling intelligent, general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems. Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution. Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent, general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits. Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code, supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain. Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts, simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and semantic bug localization. Chronos outperforms prior LLMs and code models, demonstrating a 23% improvement in real-world bug detection and reducing debugging cycles by up to 40% compared to traditional sequence-based approaches. By natively interfacing with IDEs and CI/CD workflows, Chronos enables seamless, autonomous software maintenance, elevating code reliability and productivity while reducing manual effort. These results mark a critical advance toward self-sustaining, continuously optimized software ecosystems.

This article explores the use of quantum machine learning (QML) techniques, specifically quantum transfer learning (QTL), to improve the performance of a weak classical deep learning model in detecting dementia. The study focuses on addressing the challenges of high-dimensional biomedical data and large datasets, which often limit the effectiveness of traditional machine learning approaches. By applying QTL to a binary classification task using the OASIS 2 dataset, the researchers demonstrate how quantum techniques can enhance the performance of a classical model for biomedical image classification.

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on advancing healthcare technology.

Summary: 
This article explores the use of predictors in competitive algorithms in a multiagent setting. The framework introduces a two predictor system, where agents predict their own future behavior as well as that of other players. The focus is on determining the best competitive ratios achievable with different predictor qualities. A multiagent version of the ski-rental problem is introduced and analyzed within this framework. In this problem, agents can pool resources for a group license for an asset, with individual renting as a fallback. The article highlights that in the case of perfect predictions for other agents, following the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions. An algorithm with improved robustness properties is proposed and benchmarked against existing solutions. This research provides insights into the power and limitations of using predictors in competitive algorithms in a multiagent scenario. <div>

Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties and benchmark it.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that (1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2) grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3) restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability, and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches, achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

Summary: 
FOUNDER is a framework that combines Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) to solve tasks in embodied environments without the need for rewards. It integrates the generalizable knowledge of FMs with the dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs by mapping FM representations to WM state space.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is https://sites.google.com/view/founder-rl.

The study showcases the effectiveness of the framework by generating object-centric event logs from real-world football data. It discusses the results obtained from different process representations.

arXiv:2507.12504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics. Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better handle variability

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate continued research, we release our model publicly.

Summary:  
- Spatial reasoning in 3D space is crucial for human cognition and tasks like navigation and manipulation.
- Current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D tasks due to their perception of 2D images.
- The MindJourney framework couples a VLM with a world model based on video diffusion for 3D reasoning.
- MindJourney improves performance on the SAT spatial reasoning benchmark by over 8% without fine-tuning.
- This approach of pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple and effective way to enhance 3D reasoning tasks.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion: they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average 8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world models for test-time scaling.

Summary:
The study explores how people utilize distributed and symbolic representations to construct customized mental models when facing novel situations. The proposed Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) combines language models for global relevance-based retrieval and probabilistic programs for coherent world models. Evaluation on a novel reasoning dataset centered on a 'Model Olympics' domain shows that the MSA outperforms language model-only baselines in capturing human-like judgments. The dataset requires assessing causal structures, leveraging background knowledge, and incorporating observations with arbitrary variables. The MSA approach demonstrates the ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, reflecting human reasoning in open-ended domains. These findings suggest that MSAs hold promise for replicating human reasoning processes in complex, unfamiliar scenarios.

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture'' (MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language; (ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines, under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Summary:
Language models (LMs) are essential for various tasks but their ability to categorize sentences based on modality has been questioned. This study identifies modal difference vectors in LMs that can discriminate between modal categories, showing more reliable categorization judgments than previously thought. The modal difference vectors emerge consistently as models become more competent, offering insights into LM modal categorization and potential applications in understanding human categorization behavior. By correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human ratings of interpretable features, the study suggests a novel approach to modeling human modal categorization behavior. This research provides new insights into LM modal categorization and its implications for understanding human modal categorization behavior. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e., whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al., 2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps, layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants' ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs, and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process, which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented and discussed.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data. However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS, outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy. Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud processing applications. The implementation code is publicly available at https://github.com/said-ohamouddou/MS-DGCNN2.

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

<div> characterization, LLM training, startup overhead, optimization framework, Bootseer <br />
Summary:
This research focuses on analyzing and addressing the startup overhead in Large Language Models (LLMs) training. The study reveals that startup overhead is a significant issue in industrial-scale LLMs, wasting up to 3.5% of GPU time. By examining the components of startup cost and its impact on training jobs, the researchers introduce Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework. Bootseer tackles three primary startup bottlenecks - container image loading, runtime dependency installation, and model checkpoint resumption - through techniques like hot block record-and-prefetch, dependency snapshotting, and striped HDFS-FUSE. Deployed in a production environment, Bootseer reduces startup overhead by 50%, showcasing its effectiveness in improving training efficiency for LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in startup overhead.

<div> Keywords: channel estimation, neural networks, wireless channels, synthetic training datasets, generalization

Summary:<br /><br />
Channel estimation in cognitive communications is essential for spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission. Neural networks are often tested on similar channels, leading to performance degradation on new data. This paper proposes offline-trained neural networks that can robustly perform over wireless channels without prior channel information. The design criteria generate synthetic training datasets guaranteeing a certain mean squared error on new channels. A benchmark design ensures intelligent operation for different channel profiles. Generalization achieved is independent of neural network architecture, demonstrated through simulations showing robust generalization to both fixed and variable delay spread wireless channels. Offline-trained neural networks alleviate the need for time-consuming online training, making them suitable for real-world implementations without parameter updates. <div>

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error (MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations, neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

Summary: <br /><br />Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, and the use of large language models like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder can result in flawed Qiskit code. In this study, a 32B model was fine-tuned using two reinforcement learning (RL) methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), with a synthetic dataset. The models were evaluated on the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, where ORPO achieved a 56.29% Pass rate at 1 attempt, showing improvement over existing models. GRPO scored 49%, outperforming general-purpose baselines as well. While GRPO excelled in basic tasks and ORPO in intermediate ones, both models were unable to solve advanced tasks. This study underscores the progress in AI-assisted quantum programming but also highlights the need for further advancements in this field. <div>

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite, VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our benchmark and code.

Summary:<br />
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical laws into deep learning for solving complex problems. However, they often struggle with extrapolation outside the training data and sensitivity to activation functions (AFs). This study introduces transfer learning (TL) to enhance PINNs' extrapolation capability within an extended training domain. TL is applied using a few selected collocation points, and an adaptive AF combining standard AFs is proposed for improved model accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show a 40% average reduction in relative L2 error and 50% average reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain without significant computational cost increase. The code for the method is available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process, making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all without a significant increase in computational cost.

The Single Conversation Methodology (SCM) is a novel approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes structured and persistent development dialogues, where all project stages occur within a single conversation. Grounded in principles of cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation, SCM defines phases, best practices, and a philosophical stance. It aims to correct passive reliance on LLMs by reasserting the active role of developers as architects and supervisors of intelligent tools. SCM offers a pragmatic solution to ad hoc interactions with generative AI by fostering a more organized and transparent development process.

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single, long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and supervisor of the intelligent tool.

The app combines patient metadata with fundus images to accurately diagnose these diseases. The three-stage pipeline includes real-time image quality assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model. Key innovations in the disease diagnosis model include multimodal fusion technique, pretraining method, and multitask model. Trained on BRSET and mBRSET datasets, InSight demonstrates high accuracy in diagnosing the five diseases and is robust across various image conditions. The multitask model contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it computationally efficient. This innovation has the potential to improve access to screenings, especially in low-resource settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity. Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b) Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions; and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets, both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images. The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases, generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times computationally efficient compared to having five individual models corresponding to each disease.

While high-fidelity reconstruction is crucial for human perception, audio coding for machines (ACoM) focuses on efficient compression and downstream task performance, neglecting perceptual nuances. This work introduces an efficient ACoM method that can compress and quantize any chosen intermediate feature representation of a trained speech/audio downstream model.

<title>Logit Arithmetic Elicits Long Reasoning Capabilities Without Training</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model 21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with minimal or no additional training.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB), which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence, with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts, oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults: decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2) Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing autonomy measures.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE) tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed, suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for more robust and flexible pipelines.

<title>Local Representative Token Guided Merging for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image, but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time. We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in transforming healthcare through the analysis and modeling of electronic health records (EHRs). However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability, clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR modeling and clinical decision support.

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases, traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.

<title>City-VLM: Towards Multidomain Perception Scene Understanding via Multimodal Incomplete Learning</title>

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g., bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named \textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation). Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data, including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics, particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations. FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible via the following URL:{\href{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/FLDmamba}{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/\model}.

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their 1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge \underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness; 2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15 real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides, PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost, indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained devices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

<title>FIQ: Fundamental Question Generation with the Integration of Question Embeddings for Video Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods primarily utilize question and answer (Q&amp;A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts, and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ generates Q&amp;A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&amp;A pairs enable the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features, ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods.

Abstract: Food is not only a core component of humans' daily diets, but also an important carrier of cultural heritage and emotional bonds. With the development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However, existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face significant challenges when dealing with fine-grained food images that are similar in shape but subtle in detail. To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for classifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet), specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image classification.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and 308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing, image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) in which multiple techniques of Static Expansion, Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated. We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods -- spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex, temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past, present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer. Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data. The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks. For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios. Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task. Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training. Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific fine-tuning on the unified recommender.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4 array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine learning models on edge devices.

<title>Argus: Leveraging Multiview Images for Improved 3-D Scene Understanding With Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds. Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model (3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

<title>Making Language Model a Hierarchical Classifier and Generator</title>

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

<title>DMQ: Dissecting Outliers of Diffusion Models for Post-Training Quantization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12933</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability. The code is available at https://github.com/LeeDongYeun/dmq.

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units, reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$, $1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application domains.

<title>UniSLU: Unified Spoken Language Understanding from Heterogeneous Cross-Task Datasets</title>

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA). However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity, limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and models at github to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Pigmented skin lesions represent localized areas of increased melanin and can indicate serious conditions like melanoma, a major contributor to skin cancer mortality. The MedMNIST v2 dataset, inspired by MNIST, was recently introduced to advance research in biomedical imaging and includes DermaMNIST, a dataset for classifying pigmented lesions based on the HAM10000 dataset. This study assesses ResNet-50 and EfficientNetV2L models for multi-class classification using DermaMNIST, employing transfer learning and various layer configurations. One configuration achieves results that match or surpass existing methods. This study suggests that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can drive progress in biomedical image analysis, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset.

<title>A Distributed Generative AI Approach for Heterogeneous Multi-Domain Environments under Data Sharing constraints</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task. The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.

<title>SMART: Relation-Aware Learning of Geometric Representations for Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a performance comparable to leading models

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available at https://crystalsixone.github.io/vln_pe.github.io/.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems. The source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework, GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy visual observations.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness, generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore, we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable, controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and IRL techniques.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete tokens.

<title>Prompt Injection 2.0: Hybrid AI Threats</title>

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks, where malicious input is designed to manipulate AI systems into ignoring their original instructions and following unauthorized commands instead, were first discovered by Preamble, Inc. in May 2022 and responsibly disclosed to OpenAI. Over the last three years, these attacks have continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures. We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies, evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

<title>SHIELD: A Secure and Highly Enhanced Integrated Learning for Robust Deepfake Detection against Adversarial Attacks</title>

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification, voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore, we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild, and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models. The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%, and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation, rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection, leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000 different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively. Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds. These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in addressing DNN training data scarcity.

<title>$S^2M^2$: Scalable Stereo Matching Model for Reliable Depth Estimation</title>

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.

<title>VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy</title>

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions (e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target, up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and 2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405 multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in Hindi.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.

<title>Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13260</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.13260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

<title>Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space</title>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the \textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity. The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line, which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation space.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method, QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%) on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition, upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish, German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English. Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language technologies for the labor market.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms, sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection. Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However, LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge. To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21 code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs. Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation systems for complex scientific tasks.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT) annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs. a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task, even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50 demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

Abstract: In visual generation tasks, the responses and combinations of complex concepts often lack stability and are error-prone, which remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and yields highly competitive results with only a few codes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

Abstract: Graph recommendation methods, representing a connected interaction perspective, reformulate user-item interactions as graphs to leverage graph structure and topology to recommend and have proved practical effectiveness at scale. Large language models, representing a textual generative perspective, excel at modeling user languages, understanding behavioral contexts, capturing user-item semantic relationships, analyzing textual sentiments, and generating coherent and contextually relevant texts as recommendations. However, there is a gap between the connected graph perspective and the text generation perspective as the task formulations are different. A research question arises: how can we effectively integrate the two perspectives for more personalized recsys? To fill this gap, we propose to incorporate graph-edge information into LLMs via prompt and attention innovations. We reformulate recommendations as a probabilistic generative problem using prompts. We develop a framework to incorporate graph edge information from the prompt and attention mechanisms for graph-structured LLM recommendations. We develop a new prompt design that brings in both first-order and second-order graph relationships; we devise an improved LLM attention mechanism to embed direct the spatial and connectivity information of edges. Our evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to understand connectivity information in graph data and to improve the relevance and quality of recommendation results.

Abstract: MuZero has achieved superhuman performance in various games by using a dynamics network to predict the environment dynamics for planning, without relying on simulators. However, the latent states learned by the dynamics network make its planning process opaque. This paper aims to demystify MuZero's model by interpreting the learned latent states. We incorporate observation reconstruction and state consistency into MuZero training and conduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate latent states across two board games: 9x9 Go and Gomoku, and three Atari games: Breakout, Ms. Pacman, and Pong. Our findings reveal that while the dynamics network becomes less accurate over longer simulations, MuZero still performs effectively by using planning to correct errors. Our experiments also show that the dynamics network learns better latent states in board games than in Atari games. These insights contribute to a better understanding of MuZero and offer directions for future research to improve the performance, robustness, and interpretability of the MuZero algorithm.

Abstract: Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.

Abstract: Large Action models are essential for enabling autonomous agents to perform complex tasks. However, training such models remains challenging due to the diversity of agent environments and the complexity of noisy agentic data. Existing infrastructure offers limited support for scalable, agent-specific fine-tuning and standardized agent data processing. We introduce ActionStudio, a lightweight and extensible data and training framework designed for large action models. ActionStudio unifies diverse agent trajectories using our proposed Unified Format 2.0, supports a range of training workflows with optimized multi-node distributed setup, and integrates robust preprocessing and real-time verification tools. ActionStudio demonstrates up to 9x higher throughput compared to existing agentic training frameworks, and our trained models yield top performances across public and realistic agent benchmarks. To support the broader research community, we open-source the ActionStudio framework and release actionstudio-98k, a curated dataset of 98k high-quality trajectories.

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings. While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks: Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative evaluation settings.

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&amp;D) is a complex task that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&amp;D via combat encounter design. By framing the problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills (TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall game fairness.

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.

<title>SmartThinker: Learning to Compress and Preserve Reasoning by Step-Level Length Control</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Abstract: Engineers are deploying ML models as parts of real-world systems with the upsurge of AI technologies. Real-world environments challenge the deployment of such systems because these environments produce large amounts of heterogeneous data, and users require increasingly efficient responses. These requirements push prevalent software architectures to the limit when deploying ML-based systems. Data-oriented Architecture (DOA) is an emerging style that equips systems better for integrating ML models. Even though papers on deployed ML systems do not mention DOA, their authors made design decisions that implicitly follow DOA. Implicit decisions create a knowledge gap, limiting the practitioners' ability to implement ML-based systems. \hlb{This paper surveys why, how, and to what extent practitioners have adopted DOA to implement and deploy ML-based systems.} We overcome the knowledge gap by answering these questions and explicitly showing the design decisions and practices behind these systems. The survey follows a well-known systematic and semi-automated methodology for reviewing papers in software engineering. The majority of reviewed works partially adopt DOA. Such an adoption enables systems to address requirements such as Big Data management, low latency processing, resource management, security and privacy. Based on these findings, we formulate practical advice to facilitate the deployment of ML-based systems.

Abstract: APT detection is difficult to detect due to the long-term latency, covert and slow multistage attack patterns of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). To tackle these issues, we propose TBDetector, a transformer-based advanced persistent threat detection method for APT attack detection. Considering that provenance graphs provide rich historical information and have the powerful attacks historic correlation ability to identify anomalous activities, TBDetector employs provenance analysis for APT detection, which summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency and utilizes transformer with self-attention based encoder-decoder to extract long-term contextual features of system states to detect slow-acting attacks. Furthermore, we further introduce anomaly scores to investigate the anomaly of different system states, where each state is calculated with an anomaly score corresponding to its similarity score and isolation score. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments on five public datasets, i.e., streamspot, cadets, shellshock, clearscope, and wget_baseline. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have exhibited better performance of our proposed method.

Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an epileptic-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using a coupled workflow between the Grover and Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.

Abstract: The increasing interest in developing Artificial Intelligence applications in the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due to privacy-related issues. In addition, the recent increase in Vision Language Models (VLM) leads to the need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding medical scans. This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the MedPix 2.0 data set. Starting with the well-known multimodal data set MedPix\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses, and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure in which noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a Graphical User Interface aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning VLMs. To enforce this point, in this work, we first recall DR-Minerva, a Retrieve Augmented Generation-based VLM model trained upon MedPix 2.0. DR-Minerva predicts the body part and the modality used to scan its input image. We also propose the extension of DR-Minerva with a Knowledge Graph that uses Llama 3.1 Instruct 8B, and leverages MedPix 2.0. The resulting architecture can be queried in a end-to-end manner, as a medical decision support system. MedPix 2.0 is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The use of AI technologies is being integrated into the secure development of software-based systems, with an increasing trend of composing AI-based subsystems (with uncertain levels of performance) into automated pipelines. This presents a fundamental research challenge and seriously threatens safety-critical domains. Despite the existing knowledge about uncertainty in risk analysis, no previous work has estimated the uncertainty of AI-augmented systems given the propagation of errors in the pipeline. We provide the formal underpinnings for capturing uncertainty propagation, develop a simulator to quantify uncertainty, and evaluate the simulation of propagating errors with one case study. We discuss the generalizability of our approach and its limitations and present recommendations for evaluation policies concerning AI systems. Future work includes extending the approach by relaxing the remaining assumptions and by experimenting with a real system.

Abstract: Music classification, a cornerstone of music information retrieval, supports a wide array of applications. To address the lack of comprehensive datasets and effective methods for sub-genre classification in mainstage dance music, we introduce a novel benchmark featuring a new dataset and baseline. Our dataset expands the scope of sub-genres to reflect the diversity of recent mainstage live sets performed by leading DJs at global music festivals, capturing the vibrant and rapidly evolving electronic dance music (EDM) scene that engages millions of fans worldwide. We employ a continuous soft labeling approach to accommodate tracks blending multiple sub-genres, preserving their inherent complexity. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, while our specialized baseline models achieve high accuracy. This benchmark supports applications such as music recommendation, DJ set curation, and interactive multimedia systems, with video demos provided.

Abstract: LLMs are ideal for decision-making thanks to their ability to reason over long contexts. However, challenges arise when processing speech transcripts that describe complex scenarios, as they are verbose and include repetition, hedging, and vagueness. E.g., during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{DeFine}, a modular framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. It then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in new situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty and incorporating it into LLM decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in areas such as consulting and financial deliberation, where making decisions under uncertainty is vital.

Abstract: The success of multi-task learning can depend heavily on which tasks are grouped together. Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains.

Abstract: Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient finetuning method for LLM that reduces memory requirements. However, current LoRA optimizers lack transformation invariance, meaning the actual updates to the weights depends on how the two LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. This deficiency leads to inefficient learning and sub-optimal solutions in practice. This paper introduces LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method for LoRA optimization, which can achieve transformation invariance and remain computationally efficient. We provide theoretical analysis to demonstrate the benefit of our method and conduct experiments on various LLM tasks with different models including Gemma 2B, 7B, and mT5-XXL. The results demonstrate consistent improvements against existing optimizers. For example, replacing Adam with LoRA-RITE during LoRA fine-tuning of Gemma-2B yielded 4.6\% accuracy gain on Super-Natural Instructions and 3.5\% accuracy gain across other four LLM benchmarks (HellaSwag, ArcChallenge, GSM8K, OpenBookQA).

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dataset that is the result of a user study on the comprehensibility of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. The study participants were recruited from 149 candidates to form three groups representing experts in the domain of mycology (DE), students with a data science and visualization background (IT) and students from social sciences and humanities (SSH). The main part of the dataset contains 39 transcripts of interviews during which participants were asked to complete a series of tasks and questions related to the interpretation of explanations of decisions of a machine learning model trained to distinguish between edible and inedible mushrooms. The transcripts were complemented with additional data that includes visualizations of explanations presented to the user, results from thematic analysis, recommendations of improvements of explanations provided by the participants, and the initial survey results that allow to determine the domain knowledge of the participant and data analysis literacy. The transcripts were manually tagged to allow for automatic matching between the text and other data related to particular fragments. In the advent of the area of rapid development of XAI techniques, the need for a multidisciplinary qualitative evaluation of explainability is one of the emerging topics in the community. Our dataset allows not only to reproduce the study we conducted, but also to open a wide range of possibilities for the analysis of the material we gathered.

<title>Out-of-Distribution Recovery with Object-Centric Keypoint Inverse Policy for Visuomotor Imitation Learning</title>

arXiv:2411.03294v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an object-centric recovery (OCR) framework to address the challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in visuomotor policy learning. Previous behavior cloning (BC) methods rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data coverage, failing in unfamiliar spatial states. Without relying on extra data collection, our approach learns a recovery policy constructed by an inverse policy inferred from the object keypoint manifold gradient in the original training data. The recovery policy serves as a simple add-on to any base visuomotor BC policy, agnostic to a specific method, guiding the system back towards the training distribution to ensure task success even in OOD situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our object-centric framework in both simulation and real robot experiments, achieving an improvement of 77.7\% over the base policy in OOD. Furthermore, we show OCR's capacity to autonomously collect demonstrations for continual learning. Overall, we believe this framework represents a step toward improving the robustness of visuomotor policies in real-world settings.

Abstract: In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the ability of models to accurately follow instructions is paramount as more agents and applications leverage LLMs for construction, where the complexity of instructions are rapidly increasing. However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.

Abstract: Training medical image segmentation models for rare yet clinically important imaging modalities is challenging due to the scarcity of annotated data, and manual mask annotations can be costly and labor-intensive to acquire. This paper investigates leveraging generative models to synthesize data, for training segmentation models for underrepresented modalities, particularly on annotation-scarce MRI. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce MRGen-DB, a large-scale radiology image-text dataset comprising extensive samples with rich metadata, including modality labels, attributes, regions, and organs information, with a subset featuring pixel-wise mask annotations; (ii) we present MRGen, a diffusion-based data engine for controllable medical image synthesis, conditioned on text prompts and segmentation masks. MRGen can generate realistic images for diverse MRI modalities lacking mask annotations, facilitating segmentation training in low-source domains; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that MRGen significantly improves segmentation performance on unannotated modalities by providing high-quality synthetic data. We believe that our method bridges a critical gap in medical image analysis, extending segmentation capabilities to scenarios that are challenging to acquire manual annotations. The codes, models, and data will be publicly available at https://haoningwu3639.github.io/MRGen/

Abstract: Detecting synthetic from real speech is increasingly crucial due to the risks of misinformation and identity impersonation. While various datasets for synthetic speech analysis have been developed, they often focus on specific areas, limiting their utility for comprehensive research. To fill this gap, we propose the Speech-Forensics dataset by extensively covering authentic, synthetic, and partially forged speech samples that include multiple segments synthesized by different high-quality algorithms. Moreover, we propose a TEmporal Speech LocalizaTion network, called TEST, aiming at simultaneously performing authenticity detection, multiple fake segments localization, and synthesis algorithms recognition, without any complex post-processing. TEST effectively integrates LSTM and Transformer to extract more powerful temporal speech representations and utilizes dense prediction on multi-scale pyramid features to estimate the synthetic spans. Our model achieves an average mAP of 83.55% and an EER of 5.25% at the utterance level. At the segment level, it attains an EER of 1.07% and a 92.19% F1 score. These results highlight the model's robust capability for a comprehensive analysis of synthetic speech, offering a promising avenue for future research and practical applications in this field.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable photometric redshift determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are available. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). The proposed implementation is able to determine both point-estimation and probability-density estimations for photometric redshifts. The methodology is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Mixture Density Network (MDN). Although results obtained show a superiority of MDN, CGAN quality-metrics are close to the MDN results, opening the door to the use of CGAN at photometric redshift estimation.

<title>SIDDA: SInkhorn Dynamic Domain Adaptation for Image Classification with Equivariant Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.

<title>LLM-RecG: A Semantic Bias-Aware Framework for Zero-Shot Sequential Recommendation</title>

arXiv:2501.19232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation (ZCDSR) enables predictions in unseen domains without additional training or fine-tuning, addressing the limitations of traditional models in sparse data environments. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced ZCDSR by facilitating cross-domain knowledge transfer through rich, pretrained representations. Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from differences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a persistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced generalization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic bias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across domains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics of each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that item embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without collapsing into overly generic or uniform representations. At the sequential level, we develop a method to transfer user behavioral patterns by clustering source domain user sequences and applying attention-based aggregation during target domain inference. We dynamically adapt user embeddings to unseen domains, enabling effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring target-domain interactions...

Abstract: We present three improvements to the standard model-based RL paradigm based on transformers: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, but only starts using imaginary data after the world model has been sufficiently trained; (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" for image patches, which improves upon previous tokenization schemes, which are needed when using a transformer world model (TWM), by ensuring the code words are static after creation, thus providing a constant target for TWM learning; and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep, instead of generating them sequentially. We then show that our method significantly improves upon prior methods in various environments. We mostly focus on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, where our method achieves a reward of 69.66% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and exceeding human performance of 65.0% for the first time. We also show preliminary results on Craftax-full, MinAtar, and three different two-player games, to illustrate the generality of the approach.

Abstract: User specifications or legal frameworks often require information to be removed from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs). This requires deleting or "forgetting" a set of data points from an already-trained model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. Our results show that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefiting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is profoundly transforming human society and concurrently presenting a series of ethical, legal, and social issues. The effective governance of AI has become a crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI, particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance. Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on international governance continues to be established and put into action, the practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index). Adhering to the design principle, "the level of governance should match the level of development," the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI, the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation. The aim is to depict the current state of AI governance in these countries through data scoring, assist them in identifying their governance stage and uncovering governance issues, and ultimately offer insights for the enhancement of their AI governance systems.

Abstract: The analysis of high-dimensional timeline data and the identification of outliers and anomalies is critical across diverse domains, including sensor readings, biological and medical data, historical records, and global statistics. However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.

Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.

arXiv:2503.12989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that our framework not only enhances occupation and skill classification tasks, but also provides a cost-effective alternative to frontier models like GPT-4o, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlow-SLAM, a robust and effective Tightly-Coupled RGBD-inertial SLAM for legged robotics undergoing aggressive and high-frequency motions.By integrating geometric consistency, legged odometry constraints, and dual-stream optical flow (GeoFlow), our method addresses three critical challenges:feature matching and pose initialization failures during fast locomotion and visual feature scarcity in texture-less scenes.Specifically, in rapid motion scenarios, feature matching is notably enhanced by leveraging dual-stream optical flow, which combines prior map points and poses. Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets. To further promote research and development, the open-source datasets and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/geoflow-slam

Abstract: Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation management, yet existing approaches often lack the integration capabilities needed to handle diverse data sources. We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications.

Abstract: This study presents an enhanced multi-fidelity Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) framework for efficient spatio-temporal flow field prediction when high-fidelity data is scarce. Key innovations include: a merge network replacing traditional dot-product operations, achieving 50.4% reduction in prediction error and 7.57% accuracy improvement while reducing training time by 96%; a transfer learning multi-fidelity approach that freezes pre-trained low-fidelity networks while making only the merge network trainable, outperforming alternatives by up to 76% and achieving 43.7% better accuracy than single-fidelity training; and a physics-guided subsampling method that strategically selects high-fidelity training points based on temporal dynamics, reducing high-fidelity sample requirements by 40% while maintaining comparable accuracy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple resolutions and datasets demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly reduce required high-fidelity dataset size while maintaining predictive accuracy, with consistent superior performance against conventional benchmarks.

arXiv:2503.19530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popular PEFT methods reduce trainable parameter count for fine-tuning by parameterizing new low-rank or sparse trainable weights in parallel to the frozen pre-trained weights $W$. However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with \textbf{9$\boldsymbol\times$} fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.

Abstract: We present an extension of K-P time-optimal quantum control solutions using global Cartan $KAK$ decompositions for geodesic-based solutions. Extending recent time-optimal constant-$\theta$ control results, we integrate Cartan methods into equivariant quantum neural network (EQNN) for quantum control tasks. We show that a finite-depth limited EQNN ansatz equipped with Cartan layers can replicate the constant-$\theta$ sub-Riemannian geodesics for K-P problems. We demonstrate how for certain classes of control problem on Riemannian symmetric spaces, gradient-based training using an appropriate cost function converges to certain global time-optimal solutions when satisfying simple regularity conditions. This generalises prior geometric control theory methods and clarifies how optimal geodesic estimation can be performed in quantum machine learning contexts.

<title>JailDAM: Jailbreak Detection with Adaptive Memory for Vision-Language Model</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but also pose significant risks of generating harmful content, particularly through jailbreak attacks. Jailbreak attacks refer to intentional manipulations that bypass safety mechanisms in models, leading to the generation of inappropriate or unsafe content. Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the responsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face three primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients, limiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings of the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from uncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They require fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world settings. To address these issues, we introduce a test-time adaptive framework called JAILDAM. Our method leverages a memory-based approach guided by policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, eliminating the need for explicit exposure to harmful data. By dynamically updating unsafe knowledge during test-time, our framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on multiple VLM jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that JAILDAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in harmful content detection, improving both accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining, but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the strongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without conditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important weights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.

Abstract: Unstructured clinical data can serve as a unique and rich source of information that can meaningfully inform clinical practice. Extracting the most pertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential toward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research has explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior studies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based filters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize information critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual, a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our proposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering and structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity, as well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical text generation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in the field of distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile devices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global model without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized approach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as healthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core architecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle, including local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular emphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation. Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable, efficient, and trustworthy FL systems.

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the issue of generating non-existing facts, known as hallucination, has garnered increasing attention. Previous research in enhancing LLM confidence estimation mainly focuses on the single problem setting. However, LLM awareness of its internal parameterized knowledge boundary under the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires answering multiple problems accurately simultaneously, remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel method, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25% in average precision.

Abstract: Personalizing Stable Diffusion for professional portrait generation from amateur photos faces challenges in maintaining facial resemblance. This paper evaluates the impact of augmentation strategies on two personalization methods: DreamBooth and InstantID. We compare classical augmentations (flipping, cropping, color adjustments) with generative augmentation using InstantID's synthetic images to enrich training data. Using SDXL and a new FaceDistance metric based on FaceNet, we quantitatively assess facial similarity. Results show classical augmentations can cause artifacts harming identity retention, while InstantID improves fidelity when balanced with real images to avoid overfitting. A user study with 97 participants confirms high photorealism and preferences for InstantID's polished look versus DreamBooth's identity accuracy. Our findings inform effective augmentation strategies for personalized text-to-image generation.

Abstract: As LLMs grow in complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance requires tight co-design across algorithms, software, and hardware. Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with comprehensive kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code changes. Focusing on performance-critical LLM kernels, we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information. Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training, instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue. In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of 2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results, fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic error analysis to reveal model limitations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without actually tuning hyperparameters.

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations, and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information. To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA, open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency and performance are optimized.

<title>Semantic Structure-Aware Generative Attacks for Enhanced Adversarial Transferability</title>

arXiv:2506.18248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

arXiv:2506.20040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models. Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose cross-layer VQ-VAE (CLVQ-VAE), a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines top-k temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic structure in word embedding space.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets, dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/SumomoTaku/DiffGuideSamp.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts - we test nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also show that all tested models exhibit a consistent recency bias varying in intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{KeyRe-ID}, a keypoint-guided video-based person re-identification framework consisting of global and local branches that leverage human keypoints for enhanced spatiotemporal representation learning. The global branch captures holistic identity semantics through Transformer-based temporal aggregation, while the local branch dynamically segments body regions based on keypoints to generate fine-grained, part-aware features. Extensive experiments on MARS and iLIDS-VID benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving 91.73\% mAP and 97.32\% Rank-1 accuracy on MARS, and 96.00\% Rank-1 and 100.0\% Rank-5 accuracy on iLIDS-VID. The code for this work will be publicly available on GitHub upon publication.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI) can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on sustainable, technology-enabled ecosystems.

<title>Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification</title>

<div> verifiers, multimodal large language models, agreement bias, self-grounded verification, task completion <br />
Summary:
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been proposed as verifiers of agent trajectories in various domains such as web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation. However, a critical limitation identified is the agreement bias, where MLLMs tend to favor information in their context window, leading to flawed behavior rationalization. To address this issue, the authors propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a method that leverages the MLLMs' sampling mechanisms for improved reasoning and evaluation. With SGV, MLLM verifiers demonstrate enhanced accuracy and failure detection rates, enabling real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents in different tasks. The application of SGV results in significant performance improvements, setting a new state of the art on benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2507.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

<div> Benchmarking, Dynamic Programming, Large Language Models, Synthetic Data Generation, DualReflect

Summary: 
Dynamic programming is a key method in operations research, requiring expert knowledge for formulation. To automate this process, a novel benchmark DP-Bench is introduced to evaluate a range of DP problems systematically. The Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a specialized 7B-parameter model, achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, surpassing them on challenging problems. The DualReflect synthetic data pipeline enhances training data scalability by combining forward and backward generation for diversity and reliability. Results show that in low-data scenarios, backward generation is preferred for correctness guarantees, while forward generation becomes more valuable at scale for diverse formulations. This trade-off highlights the importance of integrating both approaches for optimal performance in DP problem-solving. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a 7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both approaches and the importance of combining them.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*}, an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on performance.

arXiv:2507.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Summary: 
In this study, researchers explore the use of bio-inspired design in training a Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a cluttered tunnel with obstacles using only optic flow as sensory input. The agent learns to pay attention to regions of discontinuity and large optic flow magnitude in its visual field to make motor decisions. The trained agents successfully navigate the tunnel by avoiding obstacles that produce large optic flow while maintaining a centered position, similar to the behavior of flying insects. This strategy proves effective across independently trained agents, suggesting its potential as a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs. The study showcases the capacity of bio-inspired design in mimicking biological systems' navigation abilities despite limited sensory and computational capabilities. Overall, the findings highlight the promising application of bio-inspired design in enhancing autonomous UAV navigation capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Summary:
The paper introduces a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL) method for optimizing cooperative decision-making among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. It addresses the exploration-exploitation trade-off challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning by utilizing a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow, which compresses high-dimensional traffic state information. The TPE-MARL framework, based on the QMIX algorithm, incorporates visit counts and agent mutual information to balance exploration and exploitation. Through extensive simulations at varying traffic densities and CAV penetration rates, TPE-MARL demonstrates superior performance in traffic efficiency, safety, decision smoothness, and task completion. The algorithm also shows decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. The code for TPE-MARL implementation is available on GitHub.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL) method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions: First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow, effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

Summary: This paper introduces a new approach called Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) online. The algorithm efficiently samples future histories and updates policies gradually, providing theoretical guarantees that the performance loss is bounded by the average of sampling errors. Empirical evaluations on complex problems with changing environments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly in a helicopter emergency scenario that needed around 150 planning steps. The results support the theoretical findings and show that the solver surpasses existing online benchmarks in terms of performance. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150 planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics. Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic. This work advances the automated design of robust, physically grounded heuristics, promoting trustworthy models for complex energy systems.

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.

Summary:<br /><br />
This study investigates the use of generative AI for resume screening and questions the assumption that AI offers unbiased decision-making. The research conducted a two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 revealed complex racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates based on demographic signals. Experiment 2 found that some seemingly unbiased models lacked core competence and relied on superficial keyword matching for evaluation. This phenomenon is termed the "Illusion of Neutrality," where a lack of bias masks a lack of meaningful judgment. The study recommends organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation framework to audit AI hiring tools for both bias and competence to ensure fairness and effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant to perform? This study investigates the question of competence through a two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex, contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation, relying instead on superficial keyword matching. This paper introduces the "Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments. This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions. However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2% accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with existing DAT acceleration methods.

Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) is proposed for accurate and efficient spatio-temporal traffic prediction in urban areas. Traditional methods struggle with capturing heterogeneous traffic patterns across different regions and time periods. DDCN overcomes these limitations by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset, allowing for better modeling of non-Euclidean spatial structures. The encoder-decoder structure of DDCN, with spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks in the encoder, emphasizes important features.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas. Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.

<div> YOLO, SAM, landmark segmentation, medical imaging, orthopaedic<br />

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of using SAM and MedSAM for landmark segmentation in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs due to their lack of fine-grained precision. To overcome this, the authors propose a novel approach using the YOLO model for object detection to provide bounding boxes that act as input prompts for SAM. By combining YOLO and SAM, the hybrid model demonstrates excellent performance in accurately segmenting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. This approach enables the segmentation of both a small pilot set of eight landmarks and an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines. The results suggest that this hybrid model can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of landmark detection in medical imaging, particularly in orthopaedic diagnostics. <div>
arXiv:2507.11551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics, with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework for diffusion models that eliminates the need for reward modeling by utilizing deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples. This approach enhances training precision and efficiency without requiring auxiliary reward models or approximation. Inversion-DPO is applied to text-to-image generation and compositional image generation tasks, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods. A curated dataset with complex structural annotations is used for compositional image generation post-training. The method opens up new possibilities for efficient and high-precision alignment in diffusion models, making them more applicable to realistic generation tasks. The code for Inversion-DPO is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

- The model performs modality translation in a learned latent space, enhancing capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony structures and soft-tissue contrast.

The framework addresses challenges of temporal modeling and modality gap, employing a dual-branch architecture integrating raw and flow inputs. Pre-VFM reprogramming applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter for embedding temporal context, while post-VFM reprogramming introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module for dynamic interaction between branches. Extensive experiments on various datasets show ST-VFM outperforms existing baselines across different VFM backbones like DINO, CLIP, and DEIT. The framework demonstrates effectiveness and robustness in spatio-temporal forecasting, establishing itself as a strong general-purpose solution in the field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Abstract: The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart manufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to computation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72% increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches. Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment in newborns.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model designed for underwater image restoration, which addresses the challenges posed by complex light propagation and image degradation. Unlike conventional GAN models, xOp-GAN utilizes multiple expert generator networks, each trained to excel in restoring images of a specific quality range. During the restoration process, the discriminator is used to select the best restored image based on its perceptual confidence score. Experimental results on the LSUI dataset show that xOp-GAN outperforms single-regressor models in terms of PSNR levels, achieving up to 25.16 dB. This approach not only improves restoration performance but also reduces complexity, making it a promising solution for underwater image enhancement tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.11562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity.

Summary: 
Hebbian learning is introduced as a method for swarm robotics, allowing for the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. This biologically inspired form of neural adaptation relies on local information, resolving challenges in learning heterogeneous control. Firstly, Hebbian learning simplifies the attribution of emergent phenomena to individual agents through local learning rules, addressing the micro-macro problem. Secondly, uniform Hebbian learning rules across all swarm members reduce the number of parameters needed, thus scaling with swarm sizes efficiently. Thirdly, evolving Hebbian learning rules based on swarm-level behavior decreases the requirement for extensive prior knowledge in optimizing heterogeneous swarms. The study demonstrates that Hebbian learning promotes natural heterogeneity emergence, leading to swarm-level behavioral switching and enhanced swarm capabilities. Additionally, the evolution of Hebbian learning rules proves to be a viable alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in standard benchmarking tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules, thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges, resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in standard benchmarking tasks.

Summary:<br />
This study evaluates the performance of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI, a challenging task due to anatomical variation and complex internal structure. Five pre-trained encoders are tested across different breast registration tasks. The results show that foundation model-based algorithms like SAM outperform traditional methods for overall breast alignment but struggle with fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical images does not always improve registration performance.

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial. Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure accuracy. We also publicly release our code at \href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, elective spine surgery, length of stay prediction, temporal modeling, interpretability

Summary:<br /><br /> This study developed and evaluated machine learning models for predicting length of stay in elective spine surgery, focusing on the benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. The SurgeryLSTM model, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory with attention mechanism, outperformed traditional ML models like linear regression and XGBoost, achieving high predictive accuracy. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by identifying influential temporal segments in the clinical data, helping clinicians understand the key predictors of length of stay. Key predictors identified in the study included bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion.

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model, SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data. Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85) and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal, explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

<div> Keywords: uncertainty quantification, deep learning, virtual sensing, Monte Carlo dropout, conformal prediction

Summary:
Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for the safe deployment of deep learning in virtual sensing applications. The Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO) framework introduces calibrated prediction intervals for neural operator-based virtual sensing, overcoming challenges of sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data. By combining Monte Carlo dropout and split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO provides spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without the need for retraining or ensemble methods. The method achieves near-nominal empirical coverage in various applications such as turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation. CMCO offers a plug-and-play solution for neural operators, enabling trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. This breakthrough bridges theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, establishing a foundation for scalable and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated, distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains. Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife, placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore, closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects. In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model, initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats. This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally, various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data

Summary: 
The article discusses the impact of AI on research, specifically in data analysis and generation. It introduces the TBJ framework to evaluate the effectiveness and ethics of AI models. While AI can enhance the work of data scientists, there are concerns about overreliance on automation. It emphasizes the importance of human-machine collaboration in the data science workflow, particularly in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous decision areas. The article suggests that AI tools should complement data scientists but stresses the need for continued training and understanding of methods to ensure ethical and effective research outcomes. Ultimately, it calls for a balanced approach to leveraging AI in research to maximize its benefits while upholding ethical standards. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys, synthesize data, conduct analysis, and write summaries of the results. While the promise is to create efficiencies and increase quality, the reality is not always as clear cut. Leveraging our framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice (TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024), we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018) throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for continued training and understanding of methods to ensure the substantive value of research is fully achieved by applying, interpreting, and acting upon results most effectively and ethically.

Summary: 
Event time series, which consist of discrete events occurring at irregular intervals, present challenges for analysis due to their unstructured and irregular nature. In this study, the authors propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations along with sparse autoencoders to learn meaningful latent representations.

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for two-lane highways, addressing the bottleneck caused by on-ramp merging areas. The framework incorporates both human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), utilizing longitudinal car-following and lateral lane-changing models. The proposed HCOMC framework includes a hierarchical cooperative planning model, a discretionary lane-changing model, and a multi-objective optimization model. Through simulation, the HCOMC is shown to enhance safety, stabilize merging processes, expedite traffic flow, optimize efficiency, and reduce fuel consumption compared to traditional methods. <div>

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption compared with benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

Summary: 
Fine-tuning AI systems can result in the creation of harmful models capable of responding to malicious requests with detailed and high-quality outputs. This jailbreak-tuning method bypasses safeguards in models from companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to comply with criminal activities such as cyberattacks and CBRN assistance. The inclusion of backdoors in these models can increase the severity and stealth of attacks, highlighting the need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Stronger jailbreak prompts can further enhance the effectiveness of fine-tuning attacks, indicating a growing vulnerability in newer AI models. The release of any fine-tunable model should be viewed as unleashing an equally capable but potentially malicious counterpart, necessitating urgent action from companies and policymakers. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However, this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks, underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its capabilities.

Summary:
- The study addresses the challenge of learning a mapping from a high-dimensional input space to a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) in Speech Quality Assessment (SQA).
- MOS exhibits high variance due to perceptual and experimental design differences, making the mapping task challenging.
- Many existing approaches do not adequately incorporate perceptual factors beyond MOS labels, potentially leading to subpar results.
- The proposed JSQA framework employs a two-stage approach: pretraining an audio encoder using contrastive learning on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS prediction.
- JND pairs are generated from clean LibriSpeech utterances mixed with background noise at different signal-to-noise ratios.
- Experimental results indicate that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly enhances model performance in SQA, demonstrating the importance of incorporating perceptual factors into the pretraining process.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score (MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

Summary:<br />
The study focuses on improving lymph node metastasis (LNM) staging accuracy in rectal cancer through the use of deep learning models. Traditional radiological criteria have limitations in diagnosing LNM accurately. The researchers propose using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature encoder model instead of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for better interpretability. By leveraging the VAE's ability to encode visual features and patterns in a structured latent space, the model 'VAE-MLP' achieved state-of-the-art performance on an MRI dataset of 168 patients. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as ground truth for evaluation, resulting in impressive metrics: AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85 +/- 0.05. The code for the model is available for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node (LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP' achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85 +/- 0.05.

<div> Keywords: grokking, neural network, test accuracy, Dropout Robustness Curve, embedding similarity, sparsity measures

Summary: 
This paper explores the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks, where test accuracy improves significantly after training accuracy. The study introduces practical metrics such as variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures to predict grokking behavior. The Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) is used to estimate the network's resilience to noise during inference, showing a transition from memorization to generalization. The variance of test accuracy under stochastic dropout exhibits a local maximum during grokking, while the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization. The embeddings tend towards a bimodal distribution independent of initialization, correlating with cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries. These metrics offer valuable insights into the origin and behavior of grokking in neural networks.

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally, the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries. These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and behaviour of grokking.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) provides a powerful declarative paradigm for knowledge representation and reasoning. Recently, counting answer sets has emerged as an important computational problem with applications in probabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This has motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While substantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development of practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.
  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of disjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected propositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative characterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring that intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows SharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology. Through extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate that SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with large answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid counting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to achieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive programs.

Summary: 

The proposed partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, aims to optimize the learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features in multimodal tasks. The framework includes a modal partitioner for segmenting modal representations, uni-modal and paired-modal learners for dedicated learning, and a uni-paired modal decoder for reconstruction. PgM enables thorough learning of features, flexible distribution adjustment for different tasks, and varying learning rates across modalities and partitions. Experimental results demonstrate PgM's effectiveness in diverse multimodal tasks and its transferability to existing models. The visualization of uni-modal and paired-modal feature distributions across modalities and tasks provides insights into their contributions. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features. PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

Summary:
PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I) addresses memory constraints in spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) by introducing distributed data parallel training and innovative index techniques. The index-batching and distributed-index-batching strategies dynamically construct snapshots at runtime, reducing memory overhead significantly. These techniques allow for training ST-GNNs on large datasets like the PeMS dataset without the need for graph partitioning. PGT-I achieved up to an 89% reduction in peak memory usage and a 13.1x speedup over standard distributed data parallel training with 128 GPUs. This work paves the way for scalable processing of spatiotemporal data using ST-GNNs, expanding the applicability of these models to larger datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.

By simplifying the images into a "skeletonized" form, the method enables accurate measurement of galaxy shapes without being limited to predefined classes. The technique was successfully applied to 125,000 images from the DESI Legacy Survey, showcasing its potential for analyzing large volumes of galaxy data.

Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images; (2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation, where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer; and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where auditing results are critical.

Summary: 
This study addresses the costly issue of railroad traffic disruptions caused by leaf-fall in the UK, amounting to over 300 million per year. Current prediction methodologies for leaf-fall timing lack scalability and reliability. The study proposes a prediction system utilizing specialized methods and satellite data to forecast leaf-fall timing accurately. By training an LSTM network on ground-truth data and satellite information, the model achieves a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end. This improved model offers promising opportunities for optimizing leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and enhancing our understanding of ecological systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures. However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

Summary:<br />
Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective in link prediction tasks but often struggle with out-of-distribution data. Graph generative models (GGMs) can generate new graphs but are limited in application. To address this, the FLEX framework combines structurally-conditioned graph generation and adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN. FLEX aims to improve link prediction performance in out-of-distribution scenarios without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Experimental results in synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate FLEX's effectiveness in enhancing performance. The framework also explores the impact of graph data augmentation on link structures. Overall, FLEX offers a promising approach to addressing the challenges of out-of-distribution scenarios in graph-based tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models (GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this, GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1) structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the effects of graph data augmentation on link structures.

<br />
Global load forecasting in power transmission networks is crucial but faces challenges like data drifts and data heterogeneity. Traditional local forecasting models struggle with scalability and accuracy, prompting the need for global forecasting models. This study explores the impact of different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity on global load forecasting. It investigates feature-transforming and target-transforming models and their response to globalization, data drifts, and data heterogeneity. Global target-transforming models consistently outperform local models, especially when supplemented with global features and clustering techniques. However, global feature-transforming models struggle to balance local and global dynamics effectively, often requiring time series clustering for managing data heterogeneity. The study also highlights the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and hierarchical forecasting. Overall, global forecasting models offer enhanced prediction generalizability, accuracy, scalability, and robustness compared to traditional local forecasting models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem. These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

Summary: 
Outdoor advertisements play a crucial role in marketing, but verifying the visibility of billboard text accurately is a challenge. Traditional OCR struggles with outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and visual noise. Multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising alternative for scene understanding without explicit detection. This study benchmarked VLMs against a compact CNN-based OCR on two datasets with synthetic weather distortions. While VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text with lower computational cost, crucial for edge deployment. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of both approaches and provide a valuable resource for further research in this area. The weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code are released publicly to support future studies.

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B, InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline (PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code publicly.

Summary:
In the study, the authors address the challenge of understanding data science and machine learning Python notebooks without re-executing them, due to data and software dependencies. They propose a notebook understanding task that generates information flow and cell execution dependency graphs. To enhance the understanding of notebooks, they introduce the Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS), combining syntactic analysis with a Large Language Model (LLM). The CRABS approach successfully resolves ambiguities in notebook interpretation, achieving high accuracy in identifying information flows and execution dependencies. Using a dataset of Kaggle notebooks, the LLM accurately resolves most ambiguities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the pincer strategy. The results show high performance in determining cell-to-cell information flows and transitive dependencies within the notebooks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs. The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures, which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver (UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

This includes societal issues such as how best to include under-represented groups in data-driven policy and decision making, or the health benefits of assistive technologies such as wearables. We provide a conceptual overview, in particular contrasting small data with big data, and identify common themes from exemplary case studies and application areas. Potential solutions are described in a more detailed technical overview of current data analysis and modelling techniques, highlighting contributions from different disciplines, such as knowledge-driven modelling from statistics and data-driven modelling from computer science. By linking application settings, conceptual contributions and specific techniques, we highlight what is already feasible and suggest what an agenda for fully leveraging small data might look like.

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.

<title>Foundation Models for Brain Signals: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.

<title>CLID-MU: Cross-Layer Information Divergence Based Meta Update Strategy for Learning with Noisy Labels</title>

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset, which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU). CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training. Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at https://github.com/ruofanhu/CLID-MU.

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and category-sensitive patterns.

Abstract: Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of increasingly autonomous AI-driven science.

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant. Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming, legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics, enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes: individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and \textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits, such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in terms of both UAR and WAR.

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient, reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures, the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle, hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are highlighted.

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and 26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code, allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding. Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that of full-time tuning.

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each instance within the multi-instance image.

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems' efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns. We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to 1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini (0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is challenging due to the substantial computational resources required. Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i) initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii) refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and $1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech. Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP, we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo) and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified, serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the certificates.

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

<title>Dual form Complementary Masking for Domain-Adaptive Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for domain-adaptive segmentation.

<title>DUSE: A Data Expansion Framework for Low-resource Automatic Modulation Recognition based on Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and enables a better separation between treatment groups than established non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

<title>SS-DC: Spatial-Spectral Decoupling and Coupling Across Visible-Infrared Gap for Domain Adaptive Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12017</link>

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID) module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids. Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

<title>Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided Multi-view Novel Class Discovery</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area, existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level, we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

Abstract: This submission to the binary AI detection task is based on a modular stylometric pipeline, where: public spaCy models are used for text preprocessing (including tokenisation, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and morphology annotation) and extracting several thousand features (frequencies of n-grams of the above linguistic annotations); light-gradient boosting machines are used as the classifier. We collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach found effective previously.

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap, we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

<title>From Static to Intelligent: Evolving SaaS Pricing with LLMs</title>

Abstract: The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing (iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS, encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However, challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic content. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing landscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2 across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation. This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made publicly available to support reproducibility and future research https://github.com/azhar-ikhtiarudin/bench-rlqas.

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and image processing with the integration of computer scientists into multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling (SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

<title>Selective Quantization Tuning for ONNX Models</title>

Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues, quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the original model.

<title>Quantize More, Lose Less: Autoregressive Generation from Residually Quantized Speech Representations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12197</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances, speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies: the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity, general-purpose speech and audio generation.

Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior, providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

Abstract: Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs. These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI development.

<title>Looking for Fairness in Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape? Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of view.

<title>Improving Contextual ASR via Multi-grained Fusion with Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12252</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level components both contribute significantly to the performance gains, complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular, rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding. Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues. Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

<title>A Framework for Nonstationary Gaussian Processes with Neural Network Parameters</title>

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure. Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

<title>Site-Level Fine-Tuning with Progressive Layer Freezing: Towards Robust Prediction of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia from Day-1 Chest Radiographs in Extremely Preterm Infants</title>

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering; however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks, overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family, specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI (small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media, scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC). Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes all embeddings from different models and code at https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge, (2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model (PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput. For further study, the source code of our method is available at https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PROL.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs for VHDL.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is, for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically, the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel. We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates $\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have applications in future technologies like DNA storage.

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements, CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18 backbone.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation, where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses, they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently. FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class. Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation, overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network, FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\% range, underscoring the intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and evaluation code publicly available at https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover, temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting, and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P). Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning) framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally, we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale production datasets in autonomous driving.

<title>QuRe: Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling in Composed Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ (HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset.

Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available at https://github.com/nutig/RayTracing

<title>Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data</title>

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows, and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5 increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74), and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness (4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based retrieval. The source code will be released at https://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&amp;E-stained regions, it outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset will be available at GitHub.

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website: https://rchalyang.github.io/EgoVLA

<title>Characterizing State Space Model (SSM) and SSM-Transformer Hybrid Language Model Performance with Long Context Length</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12442</link>

arXiv:2507.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.

Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction. Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps, showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify, which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and can lead to different global behaviors.

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images. A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance regulates the exercise of authority and control over the management of AI. It aims at leveraging AI through effective use of data and minimization of AI-related cost and risk. While topics such as AI governance and AI ethics are thoroughly discussed on a theoretical, philosophical, societal and regulatory level, there is limited work on AI governance targeted to companies and corporations. This work views AI products as systems, where key functionality is delivered by machine learning (ML) models leveraging (training) data. We derive a conceptual framework by synthesizing literature on AI and related fields such as ML. Our framework decomposes AI governance into governance of data, (ML) models and (AI) systems along four dimensions. It relates to existing IT and data governance frameworks and practices. It can be adopted by practitioners and academics alike. For practitioners the synthesis of mainly research papers, but also practitioner publications and publications of regulatory bodies provides a valuable starting point to implement AI governance, while for academics the paper highlights a number of areas of AI governance that deserve more attention.

Abstract: This paper introduces RACER, the Rational Artificial Intelligence Car-following model Enhanced by Reality, a cutting-edge deep learning car-following model, that satisfies partial derivative constraints, designed to predict Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) driving behavior while staying theoretically feasible. Unlike conventional models, RACER effectively integrates Rational Driving Constraints (RDCs), crucial tenets of actual driving, resulting in strikingly accurate and realistic predictions. Against established models like the Optimal Velocity Relative Velocity (OVRV), a car-following Neural Network (NN), and a car-following Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), RACER excels across key metrics, such as acceleration, velocity, and spacing. Notably, it displays a perfect adherence to the RDCs, registering zero violations, in stark contrast to other models. This study highlights the immense value of incorporating physical constraints within AI models, especially for augmenting safety measures in transportation. It also paves the way for future research to test these models against human driving data, with the potential to guide safer and more rational driving behavior. The versatility of the proposed model, including its potential to incorporate additional derivative constraints and broader architectural applications, enhances its appeal and broadens its impact within the scientific community.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models(LLMs) like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debates on GenAI's transformative nature and regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance, encompassing technical and business perspectives. Although numerous frameworks for governance of AI exist, it is not clear to what extent they apply to GenAI. Our review paper fills this gap by surveying recent works with the purpose of better understanding fundamental characteristics of GenAI and adjusting prior frameworks specifically towards GenAI governance within companies. To do so, it extends Nickerson's framework development processes to include prior conceptualizations. Our framework outlines the scope, objectives, and governance mechanisms tailored to harness business opportunities as well as mitigate risks associated with GenAI integration. Our research contributes a focused approach to GenAI governance, offering practical insights for companies navigating the challenges of GenAI adoption and highlighting research gaps.

Abstract: Living beings are able to solve a wide variety of problems that they encounter rarely or only once. Without the benefit of extensive and repeated experience with these problems, they can solve them in an ad-hoc manner. We call this capacity to always find a solution to a physically solvable problem $hyperadaptability$. To explain how hyperadaptability can be achieved, we propose a theory that frames behavior as the physical manifestation of a self-modifying search procedure. Rather than exploring randomly, our system achieves robust problem-solving by dynamically ordering an infinite set of continuous behaviors according to simplicity and effectiveness. Behaviors are sampled from paths over cognitive graphs, their order determined by a tight behavior-execution/graph-modification feedback loop. We implement cognitive graphs using Hebbian-learning and a novel harmonic neural representation supporting flexible information storage. We validate our approach through simulation experiments showing rapid achievement of highly-robust navigation ability in complex mazes, as well as high reward on difficult extensions of classic reinforcement learning problems. This framework offers a new theoretical model for developmental learning and paves the way for robots that can autonomously master complex skills and handle exceptional circumstances.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, concerns about their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - factually inaccurate or irrelevant outputs - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the uncertainty in training dynamics and the emergence of hallucinations. Using models from the Pythia suite and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends and identify significant variance during training. To address this, we propose \textbf{Sensitivity Dropout (SenD)}, a novel training protocol designed to reduce hallucination variance during training by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore in 2x speed. This metric is integrated into our training protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucination variance. SenD improves test-time reliability of Pythia and Meta's Llama models by up to 17\% and enhances factual accuracy in Wikipedia, Medical, Legal, and Coding domains without affecting downstream task performance.

Abstract: Learning STRIPS action models from action traces alone is a challenging problem as it involves learning the domain predicates as well. In this work, a novel approach is introduced which, like the well-known LOCM systems, is scalable, but like SAT approaches, is sound and complete. Furthermore, the approach is general and imposes no restrictions on the hidden domain or the number or arity of the predicates. The new learning method is based on an \emph{efficient, novel test} that checks whether the assumption that a predicate is affected by a set of action patterns, namely, actions with specific argument positions, is consistent with the traces. The predicates and action patterns that pass the test provide the basis for the learned domain that is then easily completed with preconditions and static predicates. The new method is studied theoretically and experimentally. For the latter, the method is evaluated on traces and graphs obtained from standard classical domains like the 8-puzzle, which involve hundreds of thousands of states and transitions. The learned representations are then verified on larger instances.

Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>Generative Emergent Communication: Large Language Model is a Collective World Model</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct sensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.

Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.

Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&amp;A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.

<title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

Abstract: We introduce EPIC-SOUNDS, a large-scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos. We propose an annotation pipeline where annotators temporally label distinguishable audio segments and describe the action that could have caused this sound. We identify actions that can be discriminated purely from audio, through grouping these free-form descriptions of audio into classes. For actions that involve objects colliding, we collect human annotations of the materials of these objects (e.g. a glass object being placed on a wooden surface), which we verify from video, discarding ambiguities. Overall, EPIC-SOUNDS includes 78.4k categorised segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes as well as 39.2k non-categorised segments. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art audio recognition and detection models on our dataset, for both audio-only and audio-visual methods. We also conduct analysis on: the temporal overlap between audio events, the temporal and label correlations between audio and visual modalities, the ambiguities in annotating materials from audio-only input, the importance of audio-only labels and the limitations of current models to understand actions that sound.

Abstract: This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.

Abstract: In light of emerging legal requirements and policies focused on privacy protection, there is a growing trend of companies across various industries adopting Federated Learning (FL). This decentralized approach involves multiple clients or silos, collaboratively training a global model under the coordination of a central server while utilizing their private local data. Unlike traditional methods that necessitate data sharing and transmission, Cross-Silo FL allows clients to share model updates rather than raw data, thereby enhancing privacy. Despite its growing adoption, the carbon impact associated with Cross-Silo FL remains poorly understood due to the limited research in this area. This study seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating the sustainability of Cross-Silo FL throughout the entire AI product lifecycle, extending the analysis beyond the model training phase alone. We systematically compare this decentralized method with traditional centralized approaches and present a robust quantitative framework for assessing the costs and CO2 emissions in real-world Cross-Silo FL environments. Our findings indicate that the energy consumption and costs of model training are comparable between Cross-Silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning. However, the additional data transfer and storage requirements inherent in Centralized Learning can result in significant, often overlooked CO2 emissions. Moreover, we introduce an innovative data and application management system that integrates Cross-Silo FL and analytics, aiming at improving the sustainability and economic efficiency of IT enterprises.

Abstract: Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.

<title>On the Statistical Properties of Generative Adversarial Models for Low Intrinsic Data Dimension</title>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the theoretical guarantees for their statistical accuracy remain rather pessimistic. In particular, the data distributions on which GANs are applied, such as natural images, are often hypothesized to have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure in a typically high-dimensional feature space, but this is often not reflected in the derived rates in the state-of-the-art analyses. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of GANs and their bidirectional variant, Bi-directional GANs (BiGANs), by deriving statistical guarantees on the estimated densities in terms of the intrinsic dimension of the data and the latent space. We analytically show that if one has access to $n$ samples from the unknown target distribution and the network architectures are properly chosen, the expected Wasserstein-1 distance of the estimates from the target scales as $O\left( n^{-1/d_\mu } \right)$ for GANs and $\tilde{O}\left( n^{-1/(d_\mu+\ell)} \right)$ for BiGANs, where $d_\mu$ and $\ell$ are the upper Wasserstein-1 dimension of the data-distribution and latent-space dimension, respectively. The theoretical analyses not only suggest that these methods successfully avoid the curse of dimensionality, in the sense that the exponent of $n$ in the error rates does not depend on the data dimension but also serve to bridge the gap between the theoretical analyses of GANs and the known sharp rates from optimal transport literature. Additionally, we demonstrate that GANs can effectively achieve the minimax optimal rate even for non-smooth underlying distributions, with the use of interpolating generator networks.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios.

Under controlled water tank validation conditions, StreakNet-Arch with Self-Attention or DBC-Attention outperforms traditional bandpass filtering and achieves higher $F_1$ scores than learning-based MP networks and CNNs at comparable model size and complexity. Real-time benchmarks on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 show a constant Average Imaging Time (54 to 84 ms) regardless of frame count, versus a linear increase (58 to 1,257 ms) for conventional methods. To facilitate further research, we contribute a publicly available streak-tube camera image dataset contains 2,695,168 real-world underwater 3D point cloud data. More importantly, we validate our UCLR system in a South China Sea trial, reaching an error of 46mm for 3D target at 1,000 m depth and 20 m range.

Abstract: State-of-the-art link prediction (LP) models demonstrate impressive benchmark results. However, popular benchmark datasets often assume that training, validation, and testing samples are representative of the overall dataset distribution. In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; uncontrolled factors lead new dataset samples to come from a different distribution than training samples. Additionally, the majority of recent work with graph dataset shift focuses on node- and graph-level tasks, largely ignoring link-level tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel splitting strategy, known as LPShift, which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify LPShift's effect through empirical evaluation of SOTA LP models on 16 LPShift variants of original dataset splits, with results indicating drastic changes to model performance. Additional experiments demonstrate graph structure has a strong influence on the success of current generalization methods. Source Code Available Here: https://github.com/revolins/LPShift

Abstract: Despite their success, Large-Language Models (LLMs) still face criticism due to their lack of interpretability. Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods, based on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insights as they only approximate the model's decision-making processes and have been proved to be unreliable. For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been lately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based on human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several limitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity, to the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task predictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for real-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the current accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is better than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show that the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and causally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that LICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts can be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a popular benchmark focused on visual reasoning in the evaluation of Artificial Intelligence systems. In its original framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over small 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt the recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision Transformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output image, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a state-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even when trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent representational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of uncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on these insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some of the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC. Specifically, we use a pixel-level input representation, design a spatially-aware tokenization scheme, and introduce a novel object-based positional encoding that leverages automatic segmentation, among other enhancements. Our task-specific ViTARC models achieve a test solve rate close to 100% on more than half of the 400 public ARC tasks strictly through supervised learning from input-output grids. This calls attention to the importance of imbuing the powerful (Vision) Transformer with the correct inductive biases for abstract visual reasoning that are critical even when the training data is plentiful and the mapping is noise-free. Hence, ViTARC provides a strong foundation for future research in visual reasoning using transformer-based architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used to transfer knowledge from large, accurate models (teachers) to smaller, efficient ones (students). Recent methods have explored enforcing consistency by incorporating causal interpretations to distill invariant representations. In this work, we extend this line of research by introducing a dual augmentation strategy to promote invariant feature learning in both teacher and student models. Our approach leverages different augmentations applied to both models during distillation, pushing the student to capture robust, transferable features. This dual augmentation strategy complements invariant causal distillation by ensuring that the learned representations remain stable across a wider range of data variations and transformations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving competitive results in same-architecture KD.

<title>Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. The code is available at https://github.com/Zigned/nuplan_zigned.

Abstract: Quality molecular representations are key to foundation model development in bio-medical research. Previous efforts have typically focused on a single representation or molecular view, which may have strengths or weaknesses on a given task. We develop Multi-view Molecular Embedding with Late Fusion (MMELON), an approach that integrates graph, image and text views in a foundation model setting and may be readily extended to additional representations. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules. The multi-view model performs robustly, matching the performance of the highest-ranked single-view. It is validated on over 120 tasks, including molecular solubility, ADME properties, and activity against G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). We identify 33 GPCRs that are related to Alzheimer's disease and employ the multi-view model to select strong binders from a compound screen. Predictions are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.

Abstract: Trustworthiness in neural networks is crucial for their deployment in critical applications, where reliability, confidence, and uncertainty play pivotal roles in decision-making. Traditional performance metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture these aspects, particularly in cases where models exhibit overconfidence. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework for quantifying the trustworthiness of neural networks by incorporating subjective logic into the evaluation of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). This method provides a comprehensive measure of trust, disbelief, and uncertainty by clustering predicted probabilities and fusing opinions using appropriate fusion operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, where post-calibration results indicate improved trustworthiness. The proposed framework offers a more interpretable and nuanced assessment of AI models, with potential applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems.

<title>TextDestroyer: A Training- and Annotation-Free Diffusion Method for Destroying Anomal Text from Images</title>

arXiv:2411.00355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose TextDestroyer, the first training- and annotation-free method for scene text destruction using a pre-trained diffusion model. Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.

Abstract: Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.

Abstract: We present Patherea, a unified framework for point-based cell detection and classification that enables the development and fair evaluation of state-of-the-art methods. To support this, we introduce a large-scale dataset that replicates the clinical workflow for Ki-67 proliferation index estimation. Our method directly predicts cell locations and classes without relying on intermediate representations. It incorporates a hybrid Hungarian matching strategy for accurate point assignment and supports flexible backbones and training regimes, including recent pathology foundation models. Patherea achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets - Lizard, BRCA-M2C, and BCData - while highlighting performance saturation on these benchmarks. In contrast, our newly proposed Patherea dataset presents a significantly more challenging benchmark. Additionally, we identify and correct common errors in current evaluation protocols and provide an updated benchmarking utility for standardized assessment. The Patherea dataset and code are publicly available to facilitate further research and fair comparisons.

Abstract: This article addresses theory in evolutionary many-objective optimization and focuses on the role of crossover operators. The advantages of using crossover are hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging far behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two objectives. We present two many-objective problems $RR_{\text{RO}}$ and $uRR_{\text{RO}}$ together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the GSEMO and the widely used NSGA-III algorithm to demonstrate that one point crossover on $RR_{\text{RO}}$, as well as uniform crossover on $uRR_{\text{RO}}$, can yield an exponential speedup in the runtime. In particular, when the number of objectives is constant, this algorithms can find the Pareto set of both problems in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover they require exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. For both problems, we also demonstrate a significant performance gap in certain superconstant parameter regimes for the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective optimization which demonstrates an exponential performance gap when using crossover for more than two objectives. Additionally, it is the first runtime analysis involving crossover in many-objective optimization where the number of objectives is not necessarily constant.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their application across various domains, including chip design, where domain-adapted chip models like ChipNeMo have emerged. However, these models often struggle with instruction alignment, a crucial capability for LLMs that involves following explicit human directives. This limitation impedes the practical application of chip LLMs, including serving as assistant chatbots for hardware design engineers. In this work, we introduce ChipAlign, a novel approach that utilizes a training-free model merging strategy, combining the strengths of a general instruction-aligned LLM with a chip-specific LLM. By considering the underlying manifold in the weight space, ChipAlign employs geodesic interpolation to effectively fuse the weights of input LLMs, producing a merged model that inherits strong instruction alignment and chip expertise from the respective instruction and chip LLMs. Our results demonstrate that ChipAlign significantly enhances instruction-following capabilities of existing chip LLMs, achieving up to a 26.6% improvement on the IFEval benchmark, while maintaining comparable expertise in the chip domain. This improvement in instruction alignment also translates to notable gains in instruction-involved QA tasks, delivering performance enhancements of 3.9% on the OpenROAD QA benchmark and 8.25% on production-level chip QA benchmarks, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Formalized mathematics has recently garnered significant attention for its ability to assist mathematicians across various fields. Premise retrieval, as a common step in mathematical formalization, has been a challenge, particularly for inexperienced users. Existing retrieval methods that facilitate natural language queries require a certain level of mathematical expertise from users, while approaches based on formal languages (e.g., Lean) typically struggle with the scarcity of training data, hindering the training of effective and generalizable retrieval models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages data extracted from Mathlib to train a lightweight and effective premise retrieval model. In particular, the proposed model embeds queries (i.e., proof state provided by Lean) and premises in a latent space, featuring a tokenizer specifically trained on formal corpora. The model is learned in a contrastive learning framework, in which a fine-grained similarity calculation method and a re-ranking module are applied to enhance the retrieval performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining a lower computational load. We have released an open-source search engine based on our retrieval model at https://premise-search.com/. The source code and the trained model can be found at https://github.com/ruc-ai4math/Premise-Retrieval.

Abstract: Metadata management plays a critical role in data governance, resource discovery, and decision-making in the data-driven era. While traditional metadata approaches have primarily focused on organization, classification, and resource reuse, the integration of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has significantly transformed these processes. This paper investigates both traditional and AI-driven metadata approaches by examining open-source solutions, commercial tools, and research initiatives. A comparative analysis of traditional and AI-driven metadata management methods is provided, highlighting existing challenges and their impact on next-generation datasets. The paper also presents an innovative AI-assisted metadata management framework designed to address these challenges. This framework leverages more advanced modern AI technologies to automate metadata generation, enhance governance, and improve the accessibility and usability of modern datasets. Finally, the paper outlines future directions for research and development, proposing opportunities to further advance metadata management in the context of AI-driven innovation and complex datasets.

<title>PATCH: a deep learning method to assess heterogeneity of artistic practice in historical paintings</title>

Abstract: The history of art has seen significant shifts in the manner in which artworks are created, making understanding of creative processes a central question in technical art history. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, paintings were largely produced by master painters directing workshops of apprentices who often contributed to projects. The masters varied significantly in artistic and managerial styles, meaning different combinations of artists and implements might be seen both between masters and within workshops or even individual canvases. Information on how different workshops were managed and the processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning methods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative processes by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale. Analysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that documentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external examples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions. Here we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment training for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying individual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or "ground truth." The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and outperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply this method to two historical paintings by the Spanish Renaissance master, El Greco: The Baptism of Christ and Christ on the Cross with Landscape, and our findings regarding the former potentially challenge previous work that has assigned the painting to workshop members. Further, the results of our analyses create a measure of heterogeneity of artistic practice that can be used to characterize artworks across time and space.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to generate structured outputs that obey precise syntactic rules, such as code snippets or formatted data. Grammar-constrained decoding (GCD) can guarantee that LLM outputs matches such rules by masking out tokens that will provably lead to outputs that do not belong to a specified context-free grammar (CFG). To guarantee soundness, GCD algorithms have to compute how a given LLM subword tokenizer can align with the tokens used
  by a given context-free grammar and compute token masks based on this information. Doing so efficiently is challenging and existing GCD algorithms require tens of minutes to preprocess common grammars. We present a new GCD algorithm together with an implementation that offers 17.71x faster offline preprocessing than existing approaches while preserving state-of-the-art efficiency in online mask computation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated gaps in diverse cultural awareness across the globe. We investigate the effect of retrieval augmented generation and search-grounding techniques on LLMs' ability to display familiarity with various national cultures. Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on multiple cultural awareness benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power. These results highlight the distinction between propositional cultural knowledge and open-ended cultural fluency when it comes to evaluating LLMs' cultural awareness.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a crucial task in computer vision aimed at enhancing the visual fidelity of images captured under low-illumination conditions. Conventional methods frequently struggle with noise, overexposure, and color distortion, leading to significant image quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose LUMINA-Net, an unsupervised deep learning framework that learns adaptive priors from low-light image pairs by integrating multi-stage illumination and reflectance modules. To assist the Retinex decomposition, inappropriate features in the raw image can be removed using a simple self-supervised mechanism. First, the illumination module intelligently adjusts brightness and contrast while preserving intricate textural details. Second, the reflectance module incorporates a noise reduction mechanism that leverages spatial attention and channel-wise feature refinement to mitigate noise contamination. Through extensive experiments on LOL and SICE datasets, evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, LUMINA-Net surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its efficacy in low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently gained attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in complex scenes due to distortions in non-personalized regions and the need for additional fine-tuning, limiting their practicality. To address this issue, we propose FlipConcept, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates multiple personalized concepts into a single image without requiring additional tuning. We introduce guided appearance attention to enhance the visual fidelity of personalized concepts. Additionally, we introduce mask-guided noise mixing to protect non-personalized regions during concept integration. Lastly, we apply background dilution to minimize concept leakage, i.e., the undesired blending of personalized concepts with other objects in the image. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method, despite not requiring tuning, outperforms existing models in both single and multiple personalized concept inference. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach for scalable, high-quality multi-concept personalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have highlighted the potential of automating interpretability pipelines in analyzing the latent representations within LLMs. While this may enhance our understanding of internal mechanisms, the field lacks standardized evaluation methods for assessing the validity of discovered features. We attempt to bridge this gap by introducing FADE: Feature Alignment to Description Evaluation, a scalable model-agnostic framework for automatically evaluating feature-to-description alignment. FADE evaluates alignment across four key metrics - Clarity, Responsiveness, Purity, and Faithfulness - and systematically quantifies the causes of the misalignment between features and their descriptions. We apply FADE to analyze existing open-source feature descriptions and assess key components of automated interpretability pipelines, aiming to enhance the quality of descriptions. Our findings highlight fundamental challenges in generating feature descriptions, particularly for SAEs compared to MLP neurons, providing insights into the limitations and future directions of automated interpretability. We release FADE as an open-source package at: https://github.com/brunibrun/FADE

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for understanding the human brain. While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-to-video reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications. Code and model weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/NEURONS.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative machine learning (ML) model training among decentralized clients' information, ensuring data privacy. The decentralized nature of FL deals with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This open problem has notable consequences, such as decreased model performance and more significant convergence times. Despite its importance, experimental studies systematically addressing all types of data heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IIDness) remain scarce. We aim to fill this gap by assessing and quantifying the non-IID effect through a thorough empirical analysis. We use the Hellinger Distance (HD) to measure differences in distribution among clients. Our study benchmarks four state-of-the-art strategies for handling non-IID data, including label, feature, quantity, and spatiotemporal skewness, under realistic and controlled conditions. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal skew effect in FL. Our findings highlight the significant impact of label and spatiotemporal skew non-IID types on FL model performance, with notable performance drops occurring at specific HD thresholds. Additionally, the FL performance is heavily affected mainly when the non-IIDness is extreme. Thus, we provide recommendations for FL research to tackle data heterogeneity effectively. Our work represents the most extensive examination of non-IIDness in FL, offering a robust foundation for future research.

Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.

Abstract: AI systems are gaining widespread adoption across various sectors and domains. Creating high-quality AI system requirements is crucial for aligning the AI system with business goals and consumer values and for social responsibility. However, with the uncertain nature of AI systems and the heavy reliance on sensitive data, more research is needed to address the elicitation and analysis of AI systems requirements. With the proprietary nature of many AI systems, there is a lack of open-source requirements artifacts and technical requirements documents for AI systems, limiting broader research and investigation. With Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as a promising alternative to human-generated text, this paper investigates the potential use of LLMs to generate user stories for AI systems based on abstracts from scholarly papers. We conducted an empirical evaluation using three LLMs and generated $1260$ user stories from $42$ abstracts from $26$ domains. We assess their quality using the Quality User Story (QUS) framework. Moreover, we identify relevant non-functional requirements (NFRs) and ethical principles. Our analysis demonstrates that the investigated LLMs can generate user stories inspired by the needs of various stakeholders, offering a promising approach for generating user stories for research purposes and for aiding in the early requirements elicitation phase of AI systems. We have compiled and curated a collection of stories generated by various LLMs into a dataset (UStAI), which is now publicly available for use.

<title>Semantic Adapter for Universal Text Embeddings: Diagnosing and Mitigating Negation Blindness to Enhance Universality</title>

Abstract: Negation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks such as Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks. Numerous prior studies have found that contextual text embedding models such as BERT, ELMO, RoBERTa or XLNet face challenges in accurately understanding negation. Recent advancements in universal text embeddings have demonstrated superior performance over contextual text embeddings in various tasks. However, due to the bias in popular evaluation benchmarks, the negation awareness capacity of these models remains unclear. To bridge the gap in existing literature, an in-depth analysis is initiated in this work to study the negation awareness of cutting-edge universal text embedding models. Our findings reveal a significant lack of negation awareness in these models, often interpreting negated text pairs as semantically similar. To efficiently deal with the conflict that different tasks need different trade-offs between topic and negation information among other semantic information, a data-efficient and computational-efficient embedding re-weighting method is proposed without modifying the parameters of text embedding models. The proposed solution is able to improve text embedding models' negation awareness significantly on both simple negation understanding task and complex negation understanding task. Furthermore, the proposed solution can also significantly improve the negation awareness of Large Language Model based task-specific high dimensional universal text embeddings.

Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices, rely heavily on static agent profiles leading to behavioral homogenization, and inherit prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we present MobileCity, a lightweight simulation platform designed to model realistic urban mobility with high computational efficiency. We introduce a comprehensive transportation system with multiple transport modes, and collect questionnaire data from respondents to construct agent profiles. To enable scalable simulation, agents perform action selection within a pre-generated action space and uses local models for efficient agent memory generation. Through extensive micro and macro-level evaluations on 4,000 agents, we demonstrate that MobileCity generates more realistic urban behaviors than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We further explore practical applications such as predicting movement patterns and analyzing demographic trends in transportation preferences.

<title>TD-EVAL: Revisiting Task-Oriented Dialogue Evaluation by Combining Turn-Level Precision with Dialogue-Level Comparisons</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19982</link>

arXiv:2504.19982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research.

<title>What's Pulling the Strings? Evaluating Integrity and Attribution in AI Training and Inference through Concept Shift</title>

arXiv:2504.21042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.

<title>On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles</title>

arXiv:2505.02274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.

<title>Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.05470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.

Abstract: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient generative audio models.

<title>How Hungry is AI? Benchmarking Energy, Water, and Carbon Footprint of LLM Inference</title>

arXiv:2505.09598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30 state-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33 Wh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and that Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short GPT-4o query consumes 0.42 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings illustrate a growing paradox: Although AI is becoming cheaper and faster, its global adoption drives disproportionate resource consumption. Our study provides a standardized, empirically grounded methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of LLM deployments, laying a foundation for future environmental accountability in AI development and sustainability standards.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.

<title>Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated</title>

Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of $0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman, level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future models.

<title>AKReF: An argumentative knowledge representation framework for structured argumentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). The proposed argumentative knowledge representation framework (AKReF) extends the theoretical foundation and enables the AKG to provide a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand. Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we apply modus ponens on premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes capturing key argumentative features such as the type of premise (e.g., axiom, ordinary premise, assumption), the type of inference rule (e.g., strict, defeasible), preference order over defeasible rules, markers (e.g., "therefore", "however"), and the type of attack (e.g., undercut, rebuttal, undermining). We identify inference rules by locating a specific set of markers, called inference markers (IM). This, in turn, makes it possible to identify undercut attacks previously undetectable in existing datasets. AKG prepares the ground for reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is essential to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, helps reasoning models learn the implicit, indirect relations that require inference over arguments and their interconnections. We use an essay from the AAEC dataset to illustrate the framework. We further show its application in complex analyses such as extracting a conflict-free set and a maximal set of admissible arguments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

arXiv:2506.05566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL, the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

arXiv:2506.06852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction, encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.

arXiv:2506.10972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy. However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning, which includes an optimal proximal term and utilizes a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model performance and clients' low computing cost.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning, address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning, each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model. The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method, to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

Summary: 
This paper proposes a strategy to accelerate the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by leveraging domain and expert knowledge. The approach involves automated generation of dynamical system computational models from relevant documents and a specific input document. Using SysML diagrams, information about component dependencies, attributes, and operations is extracted accurately. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are utilized in various tasks to enhance the generation of SysML diagrams. Case studies demonstrate the applicability of the automated SysML diagram generation process.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies, attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only. The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Abstract: Current AI agent architectures suffer from ephemeral memory limitations, preventing effective collaboration and knowledge sharing across sessions and agent boundaries. We introduce SAMEP (Secure Agent Memory Exchange Protocol), a novel framework that enables persistent, secure, and semantically searchable memory sharing among AI agents. Our protocol addresses three critical challenges: (1) persistent context preservation across agent sessions, (2) secure multi-agent collaboration with fine-grained access control, and (3) efficient semantic discovery of relevant historical context. SAMEP implements a distributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic access controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing agent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness across diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare AI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental results show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in context relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements including audit trail generation. SAMEP enables a new paradigm of persistent, collaborative AI agent ecosystems while maintaining security and privacy guarantees.

<div> Keywords: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Emergent Communication, Neural Representations, Symbolic Communication, Nash equilibrium

Summary:
The study challenges the use of artificial inductive biases in achieving Emergent Communication in Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Through experiments with the AIM framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), it is shown that agents can naturally develop symbolic communication without external biases. The neural representations exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence. This aligns with neuroscience findings suggesting that human language may not be directly used for internal thought. The AIM framework demonstrates greater generality and efficiency compared to traditional methods. The power-law distribution of symbol usage leads to three key theoretical insights: the "Neural Communication Hypothesis," the "Tool-First Principle," and the "Semantic Interpretability Paradigm." Future research will explore enhancing AIM's capabilities with Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) and investigate RL Low-Level Pre-training, offering new possibilities for combining symbolism and connectionism. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' . Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.

<div> Keywords: Multi-agent architectures, Visual and language understanding, Trust, Zero-shot settings, Modular framework

Summary:<br />
Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilizing multi-agent architectures that combine visual and language understanding. However, a significant challenge lies in trusting these agents, particularly in zero-shot scenarios without fine-tuning. This study introduces a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that incorporates generalist multimodal agents, a non-visual reasoning orchestrator, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Through benchmarking on apple leaf disease diagnosis, three configurations were tested, including zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, fine-tuned agents, and trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval. The results revealed a 77.94% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting with trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving an overall accuracy of 85.63%. The system's design separates perception from meta-reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI, which can be applied to various trust-critical domains. The software source code and components are openly released to promote reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking on Github.

Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components including the complete software source code are openly released to support reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github: https://github.com/Applied-AI-Research-Lab/Orchestrator-Agent-Trust

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, computational split-brain syndrome, symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, logical consistency

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in surface fluency but struggle with tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. The authors diagnose this as a computational split-brain syndrome, where LLMs can articulate correct principles but struggle to apply them consistently due to dissociated instruction and action pathways. This limitation is seen across domains, explaining why model behavior remains brittle even with ideal prompts. LLMs are skilled at pattern completion but lack the architectural framework for compositional reasoning. The findings suggest the need for future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. Mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles. The separation between instruction and execution pathways in LLMs also points to limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

Summary:
KG2data introduces a system that combines knowledge graphs, large language models, ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies for intelligent data acquisition and query handling in meteorology. The system uses a virtual API to evaluate API call accuracy, outperforming existing models in metrics like name recognition failure and call correctness. KG2data overcomes the limitations of LLM-based systems by utilizing a knowledge graph for domain-specific knowledge access, improving content retrieval, query handling, reasoning, relationship resolution, and data integration. Additionally, the system mitigates the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs, making it adaptable to evolving domain knowledge and API structures. KG2data offers a novel solution for intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: API calls by large language models (LLMs) offer a cutting-edge approach for data analysis. However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API calls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology. This paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs, ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition and query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we evaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure, hallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior performance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and chat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based systems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which hampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a knowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval, complex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship resolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain knowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains with high knowledge demands.

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users' behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel rule-based method for creating music by manipulating existing tunes. The approach involves parsing each tune to identify the Pathway Assembly using the Sequitur algorithm, resulting in a grammar representation. Mutations are then applied to the grammar, such as adding, removing, swapping, or reversing parts, to generate new tunes. The study investigates how tunes evolve through multiple mutations, analyzing factors like edit distances, structural complexity, and length. The impact of different mutation types on the tunes is also examined. The focus is on generating new pitch sequences from an Irish traditional tune dataset, using integers to represent pitch values. The output tunes are evaluated from a musical perspective, showcasing the potential for creating diverse musical variations through rule-based manipulation.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [ 1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially 19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar. Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune. The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only focused on generating new pitch sequences. The study is based on an Irish traditional tune dataset and a list of integers has been used to represent each tune's pitch values.

Summary:
In this technical review article, the impact of AI on energy consumption and GHG emissions in data centers is investigated. The near-term scenario suggests that the increasing demand for AI may lead to higher electricity consumption and CO2 emissions due to the power-intensive nature of data centers and the requirements for AI models. However, in the long term, AI has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions by automating and optimizing processes across industries. Despite the initial emissions bump, AI could support climate mitigation efforts and create value for businesses and society where traditional solutions have failed. The article suggests that while AI may initially strain the environment, its potential to drive CO2 reduction makes it a valuable tool in addressing climate change. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data, computing resources, and advanced algorithms, AI has entered nearly every sector. This has sparked significant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with the necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and AI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy consumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering both near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and beyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net positive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally, we discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive workflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and consumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely strain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and therefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of big data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and complex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and applications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more promising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its ability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from energy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon footprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial emissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where traditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some initial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support climate mitigation efforts.

Abstract: This paper intends to detect IoT malicious attacks through deep learning models and demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning and graph-based models regarding malicious network traffic detection. The models particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the other models

Summary:
- Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is crucial as AI becomes more prevalent in complex tasks.
- Artificial neural networks are effective at classification tasks due to their ability to process large amounts of data.
- Detecting AI assistance can be challenging, especially with abstract task data.
- Common models can classify non-machine learning-friendly data effectively with appropriate preprocessing.
- Different image formulations and a time-series formulation are created to classify abstract task data, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial quantities for accurate detection of AI aid. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is increasingly important as they become ubiquitous across complex tasks such as text generation, medical diagnosis, and autonomous driving. Aid detection is challenging for humans, especially when looking at abstract task data. Artificial neural networks excel at classification thanks to their ability to quickly learn from and process large amounts of data -- assuming appropriate preprocessing. We posit detecting help from AI as a classification task for such models. Much of the research in this space examines the classification of complex but concrete data classes, such as images. Many AI assistance detection scenarios, however, result in data that is not machine learning-friendly. We demonstrate that common models can effectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so, we construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along with an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the exploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other abstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three classical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN architecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing performance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial quantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.

<div> Keywords: mHealth, decision making, just-in-time adaptive interventions, SigmaScheduling, habitual behavior <br />
<br />
Summary: Timely decision making is crucial for mHealth interventions, especially for habitual behaviors like oral hygiene. Current fixed interval scheduling may lead to ineffective interventions for individuals with irregular routines. To address this issue, SigmaScheduling dynamically schedules decision points based on the uncertainty in predicted behavior times. This method adjusts the timing of interventions based on how predictable the behavior is, increasing the likelihood of timely support. Evaluation of SigmaScheduling with real-world data from a JITAI for daily toothbrushing showed promising results, with decision points preceding brushing events in the majority of cases. The findings suggest that SigmaScheduling can enhance precision mHealth interventions, particularly for behaviors that require timely support. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely decision making is critical to the effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. At predefined timepoints called "decision points," intelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey data and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting habitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on delivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur. Current practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour) before user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same for all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly for individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after the target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective. In this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule decision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior timing is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to the predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely intervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68 participants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily toothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points preceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to intervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can advance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive, habitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are being tested for their ability to replicate expert-driven thematic analysis of social media data. In this study, five LLMs were evaluated using Reddit datasets on xylazine. By modeling the task as a series of binary classifications and employing zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies, the best performing model, GPT-4o with two-shot prompting, achieved an accuracy of 90.9% and an F1-score of 0.71 on the validation set. The model-derived thematic distributions closely mirrored expert classifications for high-prevalence themes. The study concludes that few-shot LLM-based approaches can automate thematic analyses effectively, providing a scalable supplement for qualitative research in public health.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic analysis, a task requiring deep interpretive and domain-specific expertise. We evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic analysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set, GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score: 0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use: 16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for qualitative research.

Summary: <br />
AF-XRAY is a toolkit designed to aid in the exploration, analysis, and visualization of abstract argumentation frameworks in legal reasoning. It provides layered visualizations to reveal derivation structures, classifies attack edges by semantic roles, overlays alternative solutions on ambiguous scenarios, and identifies critical attack sets to resolve undecided arguments. By systematically generating critical attack sets, AF-XRAY helps pinpoint sources of ambiguity and explore alternate resolutions in real-world legal cases. The tool supports teleological legal reasoning by showing how different assumptions can lead to varying justified conclusions. <div>

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide formal approaches for legal reasoning, but identifying sources of ambiguity and explaining argument acceptance remains challenging for non-experts. We present AF-XRAY, an open-source toolkit for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing abstract AFs in legal reasoning. AF-XRAY introduces: (i) layered visualizations based on game-theoretic argument length revealing well-founded derivation structures; (ii) classification of attack edges by semantic roles (primary, secondary, blunders); (iii) overlay visualizations of alternative 2-valued solutions on ambiguous 3-valued grounded semantics; and (iv) identification of critical attack sets whose suspension resolves undecided arguments. Through systematic generation of critical attack sets, AF-XRAY transforms ambiguous scenarios into grounded solutions, enabling users to pinpoint specific causes of ambiguity and explore alternative resolutions. We use real-world legal cases (e.g., Wild Animals as modeled by Bench-Capon) to show that our tool supports teleological legal reasoning by revealing how different assumptions lead to different justified conclusions.

<div> Keywords: Language-guided navigation, NavComposer, NavInstrCritic, semantic entities, instruction generation

Summary:
NavComposer is a framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions by decomposing and recomposing semantic entities. It enhances instruction richness and accuracy with a modular architecture that supports flexible integration of techniques. NavComposer operates in a data-agnostic manner, enabling adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. NavInstrCritic is introduced for annotation-free evaluation, assessing instruction quality based on contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. This holistic evaluation system addresses limitations of traditional metrics reliant on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, the method facilitates scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NavComposer and NavInstrCritic in generating and evaluating navigation instructions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: therapy recommendation, chronic patients, multimorbidity, Large Language Model, multi-agent system <br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the use of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent system (MAS) for therapy recommendation in chronic patients with multimorbidity. The MAS simulates multidisciplinary team decision-making, allowing discussion among LLM agents to resolve medical conflicts. Evaluation metrics beyond technical precision and recall were defined to assess clinical goals met and medication burden. Results showed that a single agent GP performed equally well as MAS in therapy planning tasks. The best-scoring models met clinical goals but provided incomplete advice, leading to unnecessary medications and potential conflicts. This study highlights the potential for LLM-based MAS in therapy recommendation but also emphasizes the need for further refinement to address medication burden and avoid unnecessary conflicts in treatment. <br /> 
Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2507.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug interactions.

Abstract: Protein language models have emerged as powerful tools for sequence generation, offering substantial advantages in functional optimization and denovo design. However, these models also present significant risks of generating harmful protein sequences, such as those that enhance viral transmissibility or evade immune responses. These concerns underscore critical biosafety and ethical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a Knowledge-guided Preference Optimization (KPO) framework that integrates prior knowledge via a Protein Safety Knowledge Graph. This framework utilizes an efficient graph pruning strategy to identify preferred sequences and employs reinforcement learning to minimize the risk of generating harmful proteins. Experimental results demonstrate that KPO effectively reduces the likelihood of producing hazardous sequences while maintaining high functionality, offering a robust safety assurance framework for applying generative models in biotechnology.

Summary:
Climate-induced changes are causing habitats to shift, leading to the need for accurate modeling of bird species presence in different climates. A solution proposed involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and tabular data to predict bird presence by combining satellite imagery and environmental features. The CNN model focuses on capturing spatial features like forestation, water bodies, and urbanization, while the tabular method incorporates ecological and geographic data. Both systems together achieve an average accuracy of 85% in predicting bird distribution. This approach offers a scalable and reliable method to understand bird migration patterns in response to changing environments. <div>

Abstract: Due to climate-induced changes, many habitats are experiencing range shifts away from their traditional geographic locations (Piguet, 2011). We propose a solution to accurately model whether bird species are present in a specific habitat through the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (O'Shea, 2015) and tabular data. Our approach makes use of satellite imagery and environmental features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, elevation) to predict bird presence across various climates. The CNN model captures spatial characteristics of landscapes such as forestation, water bodies, and urbanization, whereas the tabular method uses ecological and geographic data. Both systems predict the distribution of birds with an average accuracy of 85%, offering a scalable but reliable method to understand bird migration.

arXiv:2507.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ExRec, a general framework for personalized exercise recommendation with semantically-grounded knowledge tracing. Our method builds on the observation that existing exercise recommendation approaches simulate student performance via knowledge tracing (KT) but they often overlook two key aspects: (a) the semantic content of questions and (b) the sequential, structured progression of student learning. To address this, our ExRec presents an end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their semantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard Q-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value estimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in estimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of our ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different educational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec generalizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces interpretable student learning trajectories. Together, our findings highlight the promise of KT-guided RL for effective personalization in education.

Summary: 
This study introduces a new approach for autonomously evolving multi-agent tactical decisions in unmanned ground vehicle confrontations. Traditional rule-based methods are inefficient in complex battle environments, while current reinforcement learning techniques lack interpretability for strategic decisions. The proposed method combines a vision-language model for scene understanding with a large language model for strategic reasoning. By integrating these two modules, the approach enables unified perception and decision-making in a shared semantic space, offering adaptability and interpretability. Unlike rule-based and reinforcement learning methods, this approach mirrors the cognitive process of human commanders. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a win rate exceeding 80% compared to baseline models. <div>
arXiv:2507.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiple unmanned ground vehicle confrontations, autonomously evolving multi-agent tactical decisions from situational awareness remain a significant challenge. Traditional handcraft rule-based methods become vulnerable in the complicated and transient battlefield environment, and current reinforcement learning methods mainly focus on action manipulation instead of strategic decisions due to lack of interpretability. Here, we propose a vision-language model-based commander to address the issue of intelligent perception-to-decision reasoning in autonomous confrontations. Our method integrates a vision language model for scene understanding and a lightweight large language model for strategic reasoning, achieving unified perception and decision within a shared semantic space, with strong adaptability and interpretability. Unlike rule-based search and reinforcement learning methods, the combination of the two modules establishes a full-chain process, reflecting the cognitive process of human commanders. Simulation and ablation experiments validate that the proposed approach achieves a win rate of over 80% compared with baseline models.

Summary: 
F2STrans introduces a function-to-style paradigm to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in code translation tasks. The approach consists of two stages: Functional learning focuses on optimizing translation correctness using high-quality source-target code pairs, while Style learning aims to improve translation readability by incorporating positive and negative style examples. A new code translation benchmark is introduced, featuring up-to-date source code, comprehensive test cases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations for thorough evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that F2STrans significantly enhances code translation performance, with Qwen-1.5B outperforming prompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 in various code translation scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code translation tasks. However, ensuring both the correctness and readability of translated code remains a challenge, limiting their effective adoption in real-world software development. In this work, we propose F2STrans, a function-to-style guiding paradigm designed to progressively improve the performance of LLMs in code translation. Our approach comprises two key stages: (1) Functional learning, which optimizes translation correctness using high-quality source-target code pairs mined from online programming platforms, and (2) Style learning, which improves translation readability by incorporating both positive and negative style examples. Additionally, we introduce a novel code translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test cases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive functional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and existing datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code translation performance. Notably, our approach enables Qwen-1.5B to outperform prompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 on average across 20 diverse code translation scenarios.

Abstract: Decentralized trading of real-world alternative assets (e.g., gold) requires bridging physical asset custody with blockchain systems while meeting strict requirements for compliance, liquidity, and risk management. We present GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold into a blockchain based stablecoin ("OZ"). Our approach combines on chain smart contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents (Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5 percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience: an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000 concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model -- multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters -- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system integrity.

Summary:
Neurosymbolic AI aims to combine learning and reasoning by merging logical and neural representations. Despite the abundance of neurosymbolic AI systems, a widely accepted formal definition is still lacking. This paper introduces a formal definition for neurosymbolic AI that abstracts its fundamental elements. Specifically, neurosymbolic inference is defined as the computation of an integral involving a logical function and a belief function. This definition encapsulates the essence of various neurosymbolic AI systems. This formal definition sets a foundation for understanding the core concepts of neurosymbolic AI and paves the way for further research and development in this field. <div>

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI focuses on integrating learning and reasoning, in particular, on unifying logical and neural representations. Despite the existence of an alphabet soup of neurosymbolic AI systems, the field is lacking a generally accepted formal definition of what neurosymbolic models and inference really are. We introduce a formal definition for neurosymbolic AI that makes abstraction of its key ingredients. More specifically, we define neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over a product of a logical and a belief function. We show that our neurosymbolic AI definition makes abstraction of key representative neurosymbolic AI systems.

Summary:
- Autonomous systems are being used in various applications, facing challenges in ensuring safety and correct behavior in dynamic environments.
- A collaborative approach is proposed to enhance trustworthiness and reliability in autonomous systems' decision-making processes.
- Trustworthiness is assessed based on different quality attributes such as perception quality, rather than relying on consensus or majority agreement.
- Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are used as formal models for aggregating and propagating beliefs, with reduction rules to optimize computational efficiency.
- Social epistemology concepts are applied to define aggregation and propagation rules for automated decision making in autonomous systems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems are becoming an integral part of many application domains, like in the mobility sector. However, ensuring their safe and correct behaviour in dynamic and complex environments remains a significant challenge, where systems should autonomously make decisions e.g., about manoeuvring. We propose in this paper a general collaborative approach for increasing the level of trustworthiness in the environment of operation and improve reliability and good decision making in autonomous system. In the presence of conflicting information, aggregation becomes a major issue for trustworthy decision making based on collaborative data sharing. Unlike classical approaches in the literature that rely on consensus or majority as aggregation rule, we exploit the fact that autonomous systems have different quality attributes like perception quality. We use this criteria to determine which autonomous systems are trustworthy and borrow concepts from social epistemology to define aggregation and propagation rules, used for automated decision making. We use Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as formal models for beliefs aggregation and propagation, and formulate reduction rules to reduce the size of the BDDs and allow efficient computation structures for collaborative automated reasoning.

<div> maximum delay, combinational modules, integrated circuits, Static Timing Analysis, Answer Set Programming

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of maximum delay in integrated circuit design, which is crucial for determining the time taken to perform computations like arithmetic operations in circuits. It highlights the impact of maximum delay on the clock frequency of synchronous systems such as CPUs. While Static Timing Analysis is commonly used to estimate maximum delay, it may not result in optimal processor speeds. The research aims to accurately compute the actual maximum delay using Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language known for efficient solvers. By modeling the problem in ASP, the study shows that ASP can effectively address complex issues in hardware design. The experimental results demonstrate the viability of using ASP to tackle challenging tasks in integrated circuit design. <div>
arXiv:2507.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum delay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is crucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an Arithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to perform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger, synchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum clock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static Timing Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can be determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead to suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum delay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally hard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring extremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem into ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address complex problems in hardware design.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge graphs, KG reasoning, DuetGraph, global-local fusion, over-smoothing 

Summary: 
DuetGraph is a novel approach for Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning that addresses the issue of score over-smoothing. It incorporates a dual-pathway global-local fusion mechanism to separate the processing of local and global information, preventing interference and enhancing representational discrimination. The method also introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy that divides entities into high- and low-score subsets, narrowing the candidate space and improving inference quality. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in reasoning quality and training efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2507.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across various domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways, preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination. In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a 1.8$\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.

Summary: 
The paper introduces AgentOps, a framework designed to address the unique challenges posed by agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models. These systems introduce uncertainty due to probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths, requiring a new approach to observability and operations. AgentOps caters to the needs of developers, testers, SREs, and business users throughout the system's lifecycle. The AgentOps Automation Pipeline comprises six stages, including behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Emphasizing the importance of automation, the framework aims to manage uncertainty and facilitate self-improvement of AI systems by ensuring safe, adaptive, and effective operation. <div>
arXiv:2507.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic systems-collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex, adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges.
  This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.

Summary: 
The Opus Prompt Intention Framework aims to enhance Workflow Generation using Large Language Models by introducing an Intention Capture layer. This layer extracts Workflow Signals from user queries, interprets them into structured Workflow Intentions, and generates Workflows based on these Intentions. By implementing this framework, LLMs are able to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale effectively with query complexity. Results from a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent query-Workflow pairs demonstrate improved semantic Workflow similarity metrics when applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework. The system significantly enhances Workflow Generation quality compared to direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases involving Mixed Intention Elicitation. This customizable, reproducible system provides a method for extracting Workflow Signals and Intentions from user queries, leading to improved Workflow Generation outcomes.

arXiv:2507.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Prompt Intention Framework, designed to improve complex Workflow Generation with instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user queries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention Framework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries, interpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating Workflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables LLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query complexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent query-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to Workflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow similarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention Framework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to LLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable LLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow Intentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention Elicitation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (EW-QBAFs) for ensuring AI decisions align with human preferences. It addresses the contestability problem in EW-QBAFs by proposing gradient-based relation attribution explanations (G-RAEs) to guide weight adjustments towards desired argument strength. An iterative algorithm is developed to adjust edge weights effectively. Experimental evaluation on synthetic EW-QBAFs simulating recommender systems and multi-layer perceptrons demonstrates the approach's efficacy. <div>

Abstract: Contestable AI requires that AI-driven decisions align with human preferences. While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support contestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs can be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability problem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences) to achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a topic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation attribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic argument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing interpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building on G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the edge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach experimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural characteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer perceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However, traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions. Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in navigation accuracy and adaptability.

Summary:
A new neurosymbolic framework has been introduced to address the challenges faced by logistics operators in making critical decisions. This framework combines natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation, enabling the conversion of user requests into structured planning specifications. It also quantifies uncertainty at the field and token levels and initiates an interactive clarification loop when confidence is low. A lightweight model, trained on a small dataset, outperforms GPT-4.1 in zero-shot performance while reducing inference latency by nearly 50%. These results demonstrate a practical approach to achieving certifiable, real-time decision-making in complex logistics scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators rerouting airlifts ahead of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, often face life-critical decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation. It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics.

Nevertheless, it shows promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability.

Summary: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges concerning agency definition, learning objective, and reward hypothesis. The framework proposed in this article draws inspiration from open-ended evolutionary theory to rethink these fundamental aspects. Evolutionary dynamics operating within individual brains are considered. The adaptation-focused view of learning is enriched with insights from evolution. The debate on scalar reward versus multi-objectives is explored using analogies from evolutionary fitness. Practical implications for exploration in RL are discussed. The absence of a formal account of agency, a core issue, is acknowledged. While the evolutionary paradigm offers some insights, it alone cannot resolve the agency question. Ideas from origins-of-life theory are proposed to provide a foundation for understanding agency and resource-constrained reinforcement learning in biological systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three core tenets of reinforcement learning (RL)--concerning the definition of agency, the objective of learning, and the scope of the reward hypothesis--have been highlighted as key targets for conceptual revision, with major implications for theory and application. We propose a framework, inspired by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three "dogmas." We revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary insights to enrich the "adaptation-rather-than-search" view of learning. We then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis, using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs. multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained reinforcement learning in biological systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential for solving real-world problems and promise to be a solution for tasks automation in industry. However, more benchmarks are needed to systematically evaluate automation agents from an industrial perspective, for example, in Civil Engineering. Therefore, we propose DrafterBench for the comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents in the context of technical drawing revision, a representation task in civil engineering. DrafterBench contains twelve types of tasks summarized from real-world drawing files, with 46 customized functions/tools and 1920 tasks in total. DrafterBench is an open-source benchmark to rigorously test AI agents' proficiency in interpreting intricate and long-context instructions, leveraging prior knowledge, and adapting to dynamic instruction quality via implicit policy awareness. The toolkit comprehensively assesses distinct capabilities in structured data comprehension, function execution, instruction following, and critical reasoning. DrafterBench offers detailed analysis of task accuracy and error statistics, aiming to provide deeper insight into agent capabilities and identify improvement targets for integrating LLMs in engineering applications. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/Eason-Li-AIS/DrafterBench, with the test set hosted at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Eason666/DrafterBench.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces IFScale, a benchmark with 500 keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to evaluate LLM systems' instruction-following performance at high densities. 20 state-of-the-art models were tested across multiple providers, with the best achieving 68% accuracy at the maximum density. The analysis identified correlations between model size and reasoning capability with distinct performance degradation patterns, bias towards earlier instructions, and categories of instruction-following errors. The insights gained can inform the design of instruction-dense prompts in real-world applications and highlight performance-latency tradeoffs.

Abstract: Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500 keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs. We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis at https://distylai.github.io/IFScale.

<br />
Group resilience in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings is formalized and investigated in this work. The focus is on the resilience of a group of agents to unexpected changes in their environment. The hypothesis is that collaboration with other agents is essential for achieving group resilience. Various collaboration protocols are evaluated empirically, showing that collaborative approaches outperform non-collaborative ones in terms of group resilience. The study highlights the importance of collaboration in achieving resilience in dynamic scenarios, emphasizing the benefits of agents working together to adapt to environmental perturbations. The findings suggest that collaborative approaches can enhance the overall robustness and adaptability of multi-agent systems, making them more effective in diverse and unpredictable environments.

Abstract: To effectively operate in various dynamic scenarios, RL agents must be resilient to unexpected changes in their environment. Previous work on this form of resilience has focused on single-agent settings. In this work, we introduce and formalize a multi-agent variant of resilience, which we term group resilience. We further hypothesize that collaboration with other agents is key to achieving group resilience; collaborating agents adapt better to environmental perturbations in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings. We test our hypothesis empirically by evaluating different collaboration protocols and examining their effect on group resilience. Our experiments show that all the examined collaborative approaches achieve higher group resilience than their non-collaborative counterparts.

<div> Keywords: large language models, natural language processing, communication, public understanding, ethical concerns

Summary:
Vague terminology in communicating about large language models (LLMs) can hinder public understanding. It is important to address unreasonable expectations regarding LLM capabilities to ensure sustainable growth in the field. Ethical failures within NLP research can lead to a lack of continued support from the public. By providing transparent communication with the general audience about LLMs, researchers can strengthen public understanding and foster support for further research. The recommendations outlined in the paper aim to bridge the gap between research advancements in NLP and public perception, emphasizing the importance of clear and ethical communication practices to maintain public trust and support for ongoing research efforts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been accompanied by rapidly growing public interest in natural language processing (NLP). This attention is reflected by major news venues, which sometimes invite NLP researchers to share their knowledge and views with a wide audience. Recognizing the opportunities of the present, for both the research field and for individual researchers, this paper shares recommendations for communicating with a general audience about LLMs' capabilities and limitations. These recommendations cover three themes: vague terminology as an obstacle to public understanding, unreasonable expectations as obstacles to sustainable growth, and ethical failures as obstacles to continued support. Published NLP research and popular news coverage are cited to illustrate these themes with examples. The recommendations promote effective, transparent communication with the general public about NLP, in order to strengthen public understanding and encourage support for research.

<div> Coral-reef-inspired, Swarm Interaction Network, carbon-neutral, wastewater treatment, energy consumption <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach to carbon-neutral wastewater treatment inspired by coral reefs. By utilizing a Swarm Interaction Network, the system achieves high removal efficiency of 96.7% with low energy consumption of 0.31 kWh/m3 and minimal CO2 emissions of 14.2 g/m3. The scalability of the system is attributed to its linear token complexity, addressing the energy-removal challenge. Field scenarios such as insular lagoons, brewery spikes, and desert greenhouses demonstrate potential diesel savings of up to 22%. Despite these promising results, the need for data-science staffing remains a barrier. Future work aims to incorporate AutoML wrappers to enhance the project, though challenges regarding governance restrictions and interpretability call for further visual analytics. <div>

Abstract: With increasing wastewater rates, achieving energy-neutral purification is challenging. We introduce a coral-reef-inspired Swarm Interaction Network for carbon-neutral wastewater treatment, combining morphogenetic abstraction with multi-task carbon awareness. Scalability stems from linear token complexity, mitigating the energy-removal problem. Compared with seven baselines, our approach achieves 96.7\% removal efficiency, 0.31~kWh~m$^{-3}$ energy consumption, and 14.2~g~m$^{-3}$ CO$_2$ emissions. Variance analysis demonstrates robustness under sensor drift. Field scenarios--insular lagoons, brewery spikes, and desert greenhouses--show potential diesel savings of up to 22\%. However, data-science staffing remains an impediment. Future work will integrate AutoML wrappers within the project scope, although governance restrictions pose interpretability challenges that require further visual analytics.

Summary:
The article discusses the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM) in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, focusing on overcoming challenges in a heterogeneous equipment setting. Traditional TTTM methods rely on static configuration data or a golden reference, which are hard to obtain in commercial manufacturing lines. The proposed TTTM analysis pipelines aim to address these issues by identifying equipment mismatches based on higher variance and number of modes in the data. Univariate methods showed high correlation coefficients with data variance and number of modes, indicating their effectiveness. Additionally, a multivariate method demonstrated a strong correlation with the top-performing univariate methods, highlighting its efficacy. The sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to hyperparameters was also analyzed. These novel approaches offer promising solutions for tool-to-tool matching in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line. Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting, where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes, respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm hyper-parameters.

Summary:
The article introduces the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function, which is based on information theory. Compared to the standard cross entropy loss function, it includes an additional term that considers the predicted probability of the true class, enhancing optimization in classification tasks with one-hot encoded labels. The function was tested on a ResNet-based model using the CIFAR-100 dataset, showing consistent improvements in classification accuracy over the standard cross entropy loss. Despite the added complexity, the proposed function maintains simplicity and efficiency similar to traditional cross entropy loss. These results suggest potential for future research in loss function design and optimization techniques.

Abstract: We propose the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function. This is a novel measure derived from the information theory. In comparison to the standard cross entropy loss function, the proposed one has an additional term that depends on the predicted probability of the true class. This feature serves to enhance the optimization process in classification tasks involving one-hot encoded class labels. The proposed one has been evaluated on a ResNet-based model using the CIFAR-100 dataset. Preliminary results show that the proposed one consistently outperforms the standard cross entropy loss function in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed one maintains simplicity, achieving practically the same efficiency to the traditional cross entropy loss. These findings suggest that our approach could broaden the scope for future research into loss function design.

<div> large language models, European Qualifying Examination, patent experts, model shortcomings, expert oversight

Summary:
The study evaluates various large language models on parts of the European Qualifying Examination for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI's GPT-4o outperformed others, with a high accuracy and F1 score. However, none of the models could fully pass the examination, highlighting the need for further development. Human patent experts found critical shortcomings in each model, emphasizing the importance of clarity and legal rationale over raw correctness. The models' outputs were sensitive to temperature changes and prompt wording, indicating the necessity of expert oversight. Future research should focus on logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. While large language models show promise, the public may overestimate their capabilities, as they still have limitations that need to be addressed. <div>
arXiv:2507.10576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions.

Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system comprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.
  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search, Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to iteratively improve its style and refine its output.
  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering a more informed online space.

<div> Keywords: poisoning attacks, diffusion models, textual inversion, semantic sensitivity maps, Safe-Zone Training<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper analyzes the vulnerability of diffusion models (DMs) to poisoning attacks, specifically focusing on textual inversion (TI) as a common target. Through the introduction of Semantic Sensitivity Maps, the influence of poisoning on text embeddings is visualized. The study reveals that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, with a bias towards lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks exploit this bias by injecting adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Adversarial signals distract DMs from relevant concept regions, corrupting the TI process. To counter these attacks, the proposed Safe-Zone Training (SZT) defense mechanism incorporates JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, restricted training to high timesteps during TI, and loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against various poisoning attacks, yielding improved generative quality compared to existing defenses. <div>

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose significant challenges to the robustness of diffusion models (DMs). In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published defenses.

Abstract: This shared task has aimed to assess pedagogical abilities of AI tutors powered by large language models (LLMs), focusing on evaluating the quality of tutor responses aimed at student's mistake remediation within educational dialogues. The task consisted of five tracks designed to automatically evaluate the AI tutor's performance across key dimensions of mistake identification, precise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback actionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and effective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the tutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all tracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human annotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still significant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four pedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34 (for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class problems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching 96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the shared task, discuss the approaches taken by the teams, and analyze their performance. All resources associated with this task are made publicly available to support future research in this critical domain.

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an individual. In recent years, digital platforms have been increasingly used to expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based solution. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of 14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically, maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental health solutions.

Abstract: Deep learning employs multi-layer neural networks trained via the backpropagation algorithm. This approach has achieved success across many domains and relies on adaptive gradient methods such as the Adam optimizer. Sequence modeling evolved from recurrent neural networks to attention-based models, culminating in the Transformer architecture. Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing (for example, BERT and GPT-3) and have been applied in computer vision and computational biology. However, theoretical understanding of these models remains limited. In this paper, we examine the mathematical foundations of deep learning and Transformers and present a novel theoretical result. We review key concepts from linear algebra, probability, and optimization that underpin deep learning, and we analyze the multi-head self-attention mechanism and the backpropagation algorithm in detail. Our main contribution is a universal approximation theorem for Transformers: we prove that a single-layer Transformer, comprising one self-attention layer followed by a position-wise feed-forward network with ReLU activation, can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence mapping on a compact domain to arbitrary precision. We provide a formal statement and a complete proof. Finally, we present case studies that demonstrate the practical implications of this result. Our findings advance the theoretical understanding of Transformer models and help bridge the gap between theory and practice.

Abstract: In this work, we compile $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidCollection}$}$, the most extensive open data suite for training and evaluating machine-generated code detectors, comprising over a million code samples, seven programming languages, outputs from 43 coding models, and over three real-world coding domains. Alongside fully AI-generated samples, our collection includes human-AI co-authored code, as well as adversarial samples explicitly crafted to evade detection. Subsequently, we develop $\textbf{$\texttt{DroidDetect}$}$, a suite of encoder-only detectors trained using a multi-task objective over $\texttt{DroidCollection}$. Our experiments show that existing detectors' performance fails to generalise to diverse coding domains and programming languages outside of their narrow training data. Additionally, we demonstrate that while most detectors are easily compromised by humanising the output distributions using superficial prompting and alignment approaches, this problem can be easily amended by training on a small amount of adversarial data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of metric learning and uncertainty-based resampling as means to enhance detector training on possibly noisy distributions.

Abstract: Policy as Code (PaC) is a paradigm that encodes security and compliance policies into machine-readable formats, enabling automated enforcement in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environments. However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.

Abstract: Effective AI governance requires structured approaches for stakeholders to access and verify AI system behavior. With the rise of large language models, Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) are now key to articulating model behavior, which necessitates a focused examination of their characteristics and governance implications. We draw on Explainable AI (XAI) literature to create an updated XAI taxonomy, adapted to prompt-based NLEs, across three dimensions: (1) Context, including task, data, audience, and goals; (2) Generation and Presentation, covering generation methods, inputs, interactivity, outputs, and forms; and (3) Evaluation, focusing on content, presentation, and user-centered properties, as well as the setting of the evaluation. This taxonomy provides a framework for researchers, auditors, and policymakers to characterize, design, and enhance NLEs for transparent AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fluency across a range of natural language tasks, yet remain vulnerable to hallucinations - factual inaccuracies that undermine trust in real world deployment. We present AutoRAG-LoRA, a modular framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that tackles hallucination in large language models through lightweight LoRA-based adapters and KL-regularized training. Our pipeline integrates automated prompt rewriting, hybrid retrieval, and low-rank adapter tuning to ground responses in retrieved evidence. A hallucination detection module, using both classifier-based and self-evaluation techniques, assigns confidence scores to generated outputs, triggering an optional feedback correction loop. This loop enforces factual alignment via contrastive KL loss and adapter fine tuning. We demonstrate that AutoRAG-LoRA significantly reduces the factual drift while preserving the efficiency and modularity of the model.

<title>Anthropomimetic Uncertainty: What Verbalized Uncertainty in Language Models is Missing</title>

Abstract: Human users increasingly rely on natural language interactions with large language models (LLMs) in order to receive help on a large variety of tasks and problems. However, the trustworthiness and perceived legitimacy of LLMs is undermined by the fact that their output is frequently stated in very confident terms, even when its accuracy is questionable. Therefore, there is a need to signal the confidence of the language model to a user in order to reap the benefits of human-machine collaboration and mitigate potential harms. Verbalized uncertainty is the expression of confidence with linguistic means, an approach that integrates perfectly into language-based interfaces. Nevertheless, most recent research in natural language processing (NLP) overlooks the nuances surrounding human uncertainty communication and the data biases that influence machine uncertainty communication. We argue for anthropomimetic uncertainty, meaning that intuitive and trustworthy uncertainty communication requires a degree of linguistic authenticity and personalization to the user, which could be achieved by emulating human communication. We present a thorough overview over the research in human uncertainty communication, survey ongoing research, and perform additional analyses to demonstrate so-far overlooked biases in verbalized uncertainty. We conclude by pointing out unique factors in human-machine communication of uncertainty and deconstruct anthropomimetic uncertainty into future research directions for NLP.

Abstract: Pneumonia, particularly when induced by diseases like COVID-19, remains a critical global health challenge requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis. This study presents a comprehensive comparison of traditional machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches for automated pneumonia detection using chest X-rays (CXRs). We evaluate multiple methodologies, ranging from conventional machine learning techniques (PCA-based clustering, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Classification) to advanced deep learning architectures including Convolutional Neural Networks (Modified LeNet, DenseNet-121) and various Vision Transformer (ViT) implementations (Deep-ViT, Compact Convolutional Transformer, and Cross-ViT). Using a dataset of 5,856 pediatric CXR images, we demonstrate that Vision Transformers, particularly the Cross-ViT architecture, achieve superior performance with 88.25% accuracy and 99.42% recall, surpassing traditional CNN approaches. Our analysis reveals that architectural choices impact performance more significantly than model size, with Cross-ViT's 75M parameters outperforming larger models. The study also addresses practical considerations including computational efficiency, training requirements, and the critical balance between precision and recall in medical diagnostics. Our findings suggest that Vision Transformers offer a promising direction for automated pneumonia detection, potentially enabling more rapid and accurate diagnosis during health crises.

<title>Repairing Language Model Pipelines by Meta Self-Refining Competing Constraints at Runtime</title>

Abstract: Language Model (LM) pipelines can dynamically refine their outputs against programmatic constraints. However, their effectiveness collapses when faced with competing soft constraints, leading to inefficient backtracking loops where satisfying one constraint violates another. We introduce Meta Self-Refining, a framework that equips LM pipelines with a meta-corrective layer to repair these competitions at runtime/inference-time. Our approach monitors the pipeline's execution history to detect oscillatory failures. Upon detection, it invokes a meta-repairer LM that analyzes the holistic state of the backtracking attempts and synthesizes a strategic instruction to balance the competing requirements. This self-repair instruction guides the original LM out of a failing refining loop towards a successful output. Our results show Meta Self-Refining can successfully repair these loops, leading to more efficient LM programs.

Abstract: Feature selection is vital for building effective predictive models, as it reduces dimensionality and emphasizes key features. However, current research often suffers from limited benchmarking and reliance on proprietary datasets. This severely hinders reproducibility and can negatively impact overall performance. To address these limitations, we introduce the MH-FSF framework, a comprehensive, modular, and extensible platform designed to facilitate the reproduction and implementation of feature selection methods. Developed through collaborative research, MH-FSF provides implementations of 17 methods (11 classical, 6 domain-specific) and enables systematic evaluation on 10 publicly available Android malware datasets. Our results reveal performance variations across both balanced and imbalanced datasets, highlighting the critical need for data preprocessing and selection criteria that account for these asymmetries. We demonstrate the importance of a unified platform for comparing diverse feature selection techniques, fostering methodological consistency and rigor. By providing this framework, we aim to significantly broaden the existing literature and pave the way for new research directions in feature selection, particularly within the context of Android malware detection.

<title>Extension OL-MDISF: Online Learning from Mix-Typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features</title>

Abstract: Online learning, where feature spaces can change over time, offers a flexible learning paradigm that has attracted considerable attention. However, it still faces three significant challenges. First, the heterogeneity of real-world data streams with mixed feature types presents challenges for traditional parametric modeling. Second, data stream distributions can shift over time, causing an abrupt and substantial decline in model performance. Third, it is often infeasible to label every data instance due to time and cost constraints. To address these issues, we proposed OL-MDISF (Online Learning from Mix-typed, Drifted, and Incomplete Streaming Features), which constructs a latent copula-based representation for heterogeneous features, detects drifts via ensemble entropy and latent mismatch, and performs structure-aware pseudo-labeling.
  This companion paper serves as a standalone technical reference to OL-MDISF. It provides a contextual discussion of related work in mixed-type modeling, drift adaptation, and weak supervision, as well as a comprehensive set of experiments across 14 real-world datasets under two types of drift scenarios. These include CER trends, ablation studies, sensitivity analyses, and temporal ensemble dynamics. We hope this document offers a reproducible benchmark for online learning on complex, weakly supervised streaming data.

<title>Divide-Then-Rule: A Cluster-Driven Hierarchical Interpolator for Attribute-Missing Graphs</title>

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC) for attribute-missing graphs is an unsupervised task aimed at partitioning nodes with incomplete attributes into distinct clusters. Addressing this challenging issue is vital for practical applications. However, research in this area remains underexplored. Existing imputation methods for attribute-missing graphs often fail to account for the varying amounts of information available across node neighborhoods, leading to unreliable results, especially for nodes with insufficient known neighborhood. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Divide-Then-Rule Graph Completion (DTRGC). This method first addresses nodes with sufficient known neighborhood information and treats the imputed results as new knowledge to iteratively impute more challenging nodes, while leveraging clustering information to correct imputation errors. Specifically, Dynamic Cluster-Aware Feature Propagation (DCFP) initializes missing node attributes by adjusting propagation weights based on the clustering structure. Subsequently, Hierarchical Neighborhood-aware Imputation (HNAI) categorizes attribute-missing nodes into three groups based on the completeness of their neighborhood attributes. The imputation is performed hierarchically, prioritizing the groups with nodes that have the most available neighborhood information. The cluster structure is then used to refine the imputation and correct potential errors. Finally, Hop-wise Representation Enhancement (HRE) integrates information across multiple hops, thereby enriching the expressiveness of node representations. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets show that DTRGC significantly improves the clustering performance of various DGC methods under attribute-missing graphs.

<title>PLEX: Perturbation-free Local Explanations for LLM-Based Text Classification</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in text classification, but their complexity hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. Explainable AI (XAI) methods like LIME and SHAP offer local explanations by identifying influential words, but they rely on computationally expensive perturbations. These methods typically generate thousands of perturbed sentences and perform inferences on each, incurring a substantial computational burden, especially with LLMs. To address this, we propose \underline{P}erturbation-free \underline{L}ocal \underline{Ex}planation (PLEX), a novel method that leverages the contextual embeddings extracted from the LLM and a ``Siamese network" style neural network trained to align with feature importance scores. This one-off training eliminates the need for subsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence. We demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks (sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than 92\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test" reveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar decline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these words are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior performance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically accelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and four orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution for explainable LLM-based text classification.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents, understanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical deployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues emotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies between emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form hierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and larger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic biases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding misclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies reveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social perception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our results hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for developing better model evaluations.

Abstract: Learning from demonstration provides a sample-efficient approach to acquiring complex behaviors, enabling robots to move robustly, compliantly, and with fluidity. In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability and robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic behaviors. Moreover, they are limited in their ability to interpolate between different tasks. These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability, excluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and rhythmic tool use. In this work, we introduce Orbitally Stable Motion Primitives (OSMPs) - a framework that combines a learned diffeomorphic encoder with a supercritical Hopf bifurcation in latent space, enabling the accurate acquisition of periodic motions from demonstrations while ensuring formal guarantees of orbital stability and transverse contraction. Furthermore, by conditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned policy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot generalization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulation and real-world experiments across a diverse range of robotic platforms - from collaborative arms and soft manipulators to a bio-inspired rigid-soft turtle robot - demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as diffusion policies, among others.

Abstract: As a primary medium for modern information dissemination, social networking services (SNS) have experienced rapid growth, which has proposed significant challenges for platform content management and interaction quality improvement. Recently, the development of large language models (LLMs) has offered potential solutions but existing studies focus on isolated tasks, which not only encounter diminishing benefit from the data scaling within individual scenarios but also fail to flexibly adapt to diverse real-world context. To address these challenges, we introduce RedOne, a domain-specific LLM designed to break the performance bottleneck of single-task baselines and establish a comprehensive foundation for the SNS. RedOne was developed through a three-stage training strategy consisting of continue pretraining, supervised fine-tuning, and preference optimization, using a large-scale real-world dataset. Through extensive experiments, RedOne maintains strong general capabilities, and achieves an average improvement up to 14.02% across 8 major SNS tasks and 7.56% in SNS bilingual evaluation benchmark, compared with base models. Furthermore, through online testing, RedOne reduced the exposure rate in harmful content detection by 11.23% and improved the click page rate in post-view search by 14.95% compared with single-tasks finetuned baseline models. These results establish RedOne as a robust domain-specific LLM for SNS, demonstrating excellent generalization across various tasks and promising applicability in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated significant promise in various physical design (PD) tasks. However, model generalizability remains limited by the availability of high-quality, large-scale training datasets. Creating such datasets is often computationally expensive and constrained by IP. While very few public datasets are available, they are typically static, slow to generate, and require frequent updates. To address these limitations, we present DALI-PD, a scalable framework for generating synthetic layout heatmaps to accelerate ML in PD research. DALI-PD uses a diffusion model to generate diverse layout heatmaps via fast inference in seconds. The heatmaps include power, IR drop, congestion, macro placement, and cell density maps. Using DALI-PD, we created a dataset comprising over 20,000 layout configurations with varying macro counts and placements. These heatmaps closely resemble real layouts and improve ML accuracy on downstream ML tasks such as IR drop or congestion prediction.

Abstract: This paper introduces \textbf{Measure Learning}, a paradigm for modeling ambiguity via non-linear expectations. We define Neural Expectation Operators as solutions to Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) whose drivers are parameterized by neural networks. The main mathematical contribution is a rigorous well-posedness theorem for BSDEs whose drivers satisfy a local Lipschitz condition in the state variable $y$ and quadratic growth in its martingale component $z$. This result circumvents the classical global Lipschitz assumption, is applicable to common neural network architectures (e.g., with ReLU activations), and holds for exponentially integrable terminal data, which is the sharp condition for this setting. Our primary innovation is to build a constructive bridge between the abstract, and often restrictive, assumptions of the deep theory of quadratic BSDEs and the world of machine learning, demonstrating that these conditions can be met by concrete, verifiable neural network designs. We provide constructive methods for enforcing key axiomatic properties, such as convexity, by architectural design. The theory is extended to the analysis of fully coupled Forward-Backward SDE systems and to the asymptotic analysis of large interacting particle systems, for which we establish both a Law of Large Numbers (propagation of chaos) and a Central Limit Theorem. This work provides the foundational mathematical framework for data-driven modeling under ambiguity.

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong decision-making abilities in screen-based interaction tasks. However, they remain highly vulnerable to pop-up-based environmental injection attacks, where malicious visual elements divert model attention and lead to unsafe or incorrect actions. Existing defense methods either require costly retraining or perform poorly under inductive interference. In this work, we systematically study how such attacks alter the attention behavior of GUI agents and uncover a layer-wise attention divergence pattern between correct and incorrect outputs. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{LaSM}, a \textit{Layer-wise Scaling Mechanism} that selectively amplifies attention and MLP modules in critical layers. LaSM improves the alignment between model saliency and task-relevant regions without additional training. Extensive experiments across 12 types of pop-up perturbations and 4 different model backbones show that LaSM consistently enhances the defense success rate. When combined with prompt-level alerts, LaSM achieves over 98\% robustness even under strong inductive attacks. Our findings reveal that attention misalignment is a core vulnerability in MLLM agents and can be effectively addressed through selective layer-wise modulation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerged as a solution for collaborative medical image classification while preserving data privacy. However, label noise, which arises from inter-institutional data variability, can cause training instability and degrade model performance. Existing FL methods struggle with noise heterogeneity and the imbalance in medical data. Motivated by these challenges, we propose FedGSCA, a novel framework for enhancing robustness in noisy medical FL. FedGSCA introduces a Global Sample Selector that aggregates noise knowledge from all clients, effectively addressing noise heterogeneity and improving global model stability. Furthermore, we develop a Client Adaptive Adjustment (CAA) mechanism that combines adaptive threshold pseudo-label generation and Robust Credal Labeling Loss. CAA dynamically adjusts to class distributions, ensuring the inclusion of minority samples and carefully managing noisy labels by considering multiple plausible labels. This dual approach mitigates the impact of noisy data and prevents overfitting during local training, which improves the generalizability of the model. We evaluate FedGSCA on one real-world colon slides dataset and two synthetic medical datasets under various noise conditions, including symmetric, asymmetric, extreme, and heterogeneous types. The results show that FedGSCA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, excelling in extreme and heterogeneous noise scenarios. Moreover, FedGSCA demonstrates significant advantages in improving model stability and handling complex noise, making it well-suited for real-world medical federated learning scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional scaling laws in natural language processing suggest that increasing model size and training data enhances performance. However, recent studies reveal deviations, particularly in large language models, where performance improvements decelerate, which is a phenomenon known as sub-scaling. This paper revisits these scaling laws by examining the impact of data quality and training strategies on model performance. Through extensive empirical analysis of over 400 models, we identify high data density and non-optimal resource allocation as key factors contributing to sub-scaling. High data density leads to diminishing returns due to redundant information, while optimal resource allocation is crucial for sustained performance improvements. We propose a sub-optimal scaling law that better predicts performance in sub-scaling regimes, highlighting the importance of data quality and diversity.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm design has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within search routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms. However, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general coding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored for algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how well can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this paper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring fine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank based (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality, then we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM outputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm design tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform their off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and match the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover, we observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm design tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings. These findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in algorithm design and open new avenues for future research.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning via maths and code datasets has become a major new focus in LLM post-training. Two particularly popular approaches are reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), but their training dynamics are poorly understood. We present a comparative analysis of RL and SFT on the same maths problems with the same model and similar hyperparameters. We find that RL yields minor in-domain gains on maths and slight degradation on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like MMLU, while both trends are more pronounced in SFT. We also analyse model parameters across checkpoints, observing that both algorithms modify query and key weights the most. Meanwhile, SFT exhibits greater updates and also affects mid-layer MLPs more, leading us to hypothesise that this may have caused the out-of-domain degradation. We therefore investigate whether freezing parts of the model during training can mitigate the reduced performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks. However, our results are inconclusive, with benefits on GPQA:Diamond and degradation on other benchmarks. Taken together, our observations provide a preliminary indication for why RL amplifies existing capabilities, while SFT replaces old skills with new ones.

Abstract: Algorithmic innovation in the pretraining of large language models has driven a massive reduction in the total compute required to reach a given level of capability. In this paper we empirically investigate the compute requirements for developing algorithmic innovations. We catalog 36 pre-training algorithmic innovations used in Llama 3 and DeepSeek-V3. For each innovation we estimate both the total FLOP used in development and the FLOP/s of the hardware utilized. Innovations using significant resources double in their requirements each year. We then use this dataset to investigate the effect of compute caps on innovation. Our analysis suggests that compute caps alone are unlikely to dramatically slow AI algorithmic progress. Even stringent compute caps -- such as capping total operations to the compute used to train GPT-2 or capping hardware capacity to 8 H100 GPUs -- could still have allowed for half of the cataloged innovations.

Abstract: The dynamic allocation of spectrum in 5G / 6G networks is critical to efficient resource utilization. However, applying traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is often infeasible due to its immense sample complexity and the safety risks associated with unguided exploration, which can cause severe network interference. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework that enables agents to learn a robust initial policy and rapidly adapt to new wireless scenarios with minimal data. We implement three meta-learning architectures, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML), recurrent neural network (RNN), and an attention-enhanced RNN, and evaluate them against a non-meta-learning DRL algorithm, proximal policy optimization (PPO) baseline, in a simulated dynamic integrated access/backhaul (IAB) environment. Our results show a clear performance gap. The attention-based meta-learning agent reaches a peak mean network throughput of 48 Mbps, while the PPO baseline decreased drastically to 10 Mbps. Furthermore, our method reduces SINR and latency violations by more than 50% compared to PPO. It also shows quick adaptation, with a fairness index 0.7, showing better resource allocation. This work proves that meta-learning is a very effective and safer option for intelligent control in complex wireless systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for time series analytics, leveraging their massive parameters and the shared sequential nature of textual and time series data. However, a cross-modality gap exists between time series and textual data, as LLMs are pre-trained on textual corpora and are not inherently optimized for time series. In this tutorial, we provide an up-to-date overview of LLM-based cross-modal time series analytics. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies existing approaches into three groups based on cross-modal modeling strategies, e.g., conversion, alignment, and fusion, and then discuss their applications across a range of downstream tasks. In addition, we summarize several open challenges. This tutorial aims to expand the practical application of LLMs in solving real-world problems in cross-modal time series analytics while balancing effectiveness and efficiency. Participants will gain a thorough understanding of current advancements, methodologies, and future research directions in cross-modal time series analytics.

<title>Game Theory Meets LLM and Agentic AI: Reimagining Cybersecurity for the Age of Intelligent Threats</title>

Abstract: Protecting cyberspace requires not only advanced tools but also a shift in how we reason about threats, trust, and autonomy. Traditional cybersecurity methods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and intelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and software tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling adversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in autonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize attack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect remains between theory and practical implementation.
  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to bridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into real-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and coordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge classical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static payoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational realities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel solution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now be modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.
  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and cybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic, Bayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM agents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed reasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and coordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent, and adaptive cyber systems.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has led to a surge in security vulnerabilities, emphasizing the critical need for robust anomaly detection and classification techniques. In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying anomalies in IoT network traffic by leveraging the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and ResNet-18, a deep learning model known for its effectiveness in feature extraction and image-based tasks. Learnable MFCCs enable adaptive spectral feature representation, capturing the temporal patterns inherent in network traffic more effectively than traditional fixed MFCCs. We demonstrate that transforming raw signals into MFCCs maps the data into a higher-dimensional space, enhancing class separability and enabling more effective multiclass classification. Our approach combines the strengths of MFCCs with the robust feature extraction capabilities of ResNet-18, offering a powerful framework for anomaly detection. The proposed model is evaluated on three widely used IoT intrusion detection datasets: CICIoT2023, NSL-KDD, and IoTID20. The experimental results highlight the potential of integrating adaptive signal processing techniques with deep learning architectures to achieve robust and scalable anomaly detection in heterogeneous IoT network landscapes.

<title>Player-Team Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer for Soccer Outcome Prediction</title>

Abstract: Predicting soccer match outcomes is a challenging task due to the inherently unpredictable nature of the game and the numerous dynamic factors influencing results. While it conventionally relies on meticulous feature engineering, deep learning techniques have recently shown a great promise in learning effective player and team representations directly for soccer outcome prediction. However, existing methods often overlook the heterogeneous nature of interactions among players and teams, which is crucial for accurately modeling match dynamics. To address this gap, we propose HIGFormer (Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer), a novel graph-augmented transformer-based deep learning model for soccer outcome prediction. HIGFormer introduces a multi-level interaction framework that captures both fine-grained player dynamics and high-level team interactions. Specifically, it comprises (1) a Player Interaction Network, which encodes player performance through heterogeneous interaction graphs, combining local graph convolutions with a global graph-augmented transformer; (2) a Team Interaction Network, which constructs interaction graphs from a team-to-team perspective to model historical match relationships; and (3) a Match Comparison Transformer, which jointly analyzes both team and player-level information to predict match outcomes. Extensive experiments on the WyScout Open Access Dataset, a large-scale real-world soccer dataset, demonstrate that HIGFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we provide valuable insights into leveraging our model for player performance evaluation, offering a new perspective on talent scouting and team strategy analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for facilitating the self-improvement of large language models (LLMs), particularly in the domain of complex reasoning tasks. However, prevailing on-policy RL methods often contend with significant training instability and inefficiency. This is primarily due to a capacity-difficulty mismatch, where the complexity of training data frequently outpaces the model's current capabilities, leading to critically sparse reward signals and stalled learning progress. This challenge is particularly acute for smaller, more resource-efficient LLMs. To overcome this, we introduce the Guided Hybrid Policy Optimization (GHPO), a novel difficulty-aware reinforcement learning framework. GHPO dynamically calibrates task difficulty by employing adaptive prompt refinement to provide targeted guidance. This unique approach adaptively balances direct imitation learning for problems currently beyond the model's reach with exploration-based reinforcement learning for more manageable tasks, effectively creating a smooth and optimized learning curriculum. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GHPO achieves an average performance gain of approximately 5% across six challenging mathematics benchmarks, consistently outperforming strong on-policy reinforcement learning and curriculum learning baselines. Further analysis confirms that our framework significantly enhances both training stability and final reasoning performance, thus offering a scalable and efficient solution for developing powerful and robust reasoning models.

Abstract: Transforming natural language into SQL queries (NL2SQL) is crucial for data-driven business applications. Existing frameworks, trained on open-source datasets, struggle with complex business logic and lack domain-specific data for fine-tuning. Additionally, evaluation methods often require annotated data and executable database environments, which are scarce in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose SQLord, an enterprise-level NL2SQL framework. First, SQLord introduces a data reverse generation approach to convert raw SQL statements into annotated data for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Second, it proposes a decomposition method for complex queries using an automated workflow generator. Additionally, SQLord features a comprehensive GPT-Judge evaluation framework, including Execution Evaluation (EXE), Query-SQL Evaluation (QSE), and SQL-SQL Evaluation (SSE), tailored to diverse scenarios. Offline tests significantly outperform state of the art baselines, and online accuracy consistently exceeds 90, highlighting SQLord's advantages and effectiveness in complex real world scenarios. SQLord has been successfully applied across multiple scenarios on the world's largest B2B e-commerce platform.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose RFF-GP-HSMM, a fast unsupervised time-series segmentation method that incorporates random Fourier features (RFF) to address the high computational cost of the Gaussian process hidden semi-Markov model (GP-HSMM). GP-HSMM models time-series data using Gaussian processes, requiring inversion of an N times N kernel matrix during training, where N is the number of data points. As the scale of the data increases, matrix inversion incurs a significant computational cost. To address this, the proposed method approximates the Gaussian process with linear regression using RFF, preserving expressive power while eliminating the need for inversion of the kernel matrix. Experiments on the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) motion-capture dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves segmentation performance comparable to that of conventional methods, with approximately 278 times faster segmentation on time-series data comprising 39,200 frames.

Abstract: The rapid development of urban low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) economy poses new challenges for dynamic site selection of UAV landing points and supply stations. Traditional deep reinforcement learning methods face computational complexity bottlenecks, particularly with standard attention mechanisms, when handling large-scale urban-level location problems. This paper proposes GeoHopNet, a Hopfield-augmented sparse spatial attention network specifically designed for dynamic UAV site location problems. Our approach introduces four core innovations: (1) distance-biased multi-head attention mechanism that explicitly encodes spatial geometric information; (2) K-nearest neighbor sparse attention that reduces computational complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(NK)$; (3) a modern Hopfield external memory module; and (4) a memory regularization strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that GeoHopNet extends the boundary of solvable problem sizes. For large-scale instances with 1,000 nodes, where standard attention models become prohibitively slow (over 3 seconds per instance) and traditional solvers fail, GeoHopNet finds high-quality solutions (0.22\% optimality gap) in under 0.1 seconds. Compared to the state-of-the-art ADNet baseline on 100-node instances, our method improves solution quality by 22.2\% and is 1.8$\times$ faster.

Abstract: Continual learning in computer vision requires that models adapt to a continuous stream of tasks without forgetting prior knowledge, yet existing approaches often tip the balance heavily toward either plasticity or stability. We introduce RDBP, a simple, low-overhead baseline that unites two complementary mechanisms: ReLUDown, a lightweight activation modification that preserves feature sensitivity while preventing neuron dormancy, and Decreasing Backpropagation, a biologically inspired gradient-scheduling scheme that progressively shields early layers from catastrophic updates. Evaluated on the Continual ImageNet benchmark, RDBP matches or exceeds the plasticity and stability of state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost. RDBP thus provides both a practical solution for real-world continual learning and a clear benchmark against which future continual learning strategies can be measured.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) show high performance across a wide range of tasks in many domains of science. In the field of electronic design automation (EDA), it is yet to be determined to what extent they are capable to understand, adapt, and dimension electronic circuits. This paper focuses on the application of LLMs to switched-mode power supply (SMPS) design on printed circuit boards (PCBs). Particular challenges for LLMs in this context include their limited ability to interpret results from key simulation tools like SPICE and the multi-step design process. To address these challenges, we suggest SPICEAssistant, a framework that provides a broad selection of tools to an LLM. The tools serve as an interface to SPICE, allowing the LLM to interact flexibly with the simulator to estimate the impact of its modifications to the circuit. To evaluate the performance of SPICEAssistant, we defined a benchmark consisting of 256 questions testing the ability to adapt circuit netlists to fulfil different SMPS design tasks. The benchmarking results show that simulation feedback effectively improves SMPS design capabilities of LLMs. An increasing number of simulation iterations leads to enhanced performance. The SPICEAssistant framework significantly outperforms the standalone LLM GPT-4o on the benchmark by approximately 38%.

Abstract: Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks. The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability. Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.

Abstract: A growing issue within conservation bioacoustics is the task of analysing the vast amount of data generated from the use of passive acoustic monitoring devices. In this paper, we present an alternative AI model which has the potential to help alleviate this problem. Our model formulation addresses the key issues encountered when using current AI models for bioacoustic analysis, namely the: limited training data available; environmental impact, particularly in energy consumption and carbon footprint of training and implementing these models; and associated hardware requirements. The model developed in this work uses associative memory via a transparent, explainable Hopfield neural network to store signals and detect similar signals which can then be used to classify species. Training is rapid ($3$\,ms), as only one representative signal is required for each target sound within a dataset. The model is fast, taking only $5.4$\,s to pre-process and classify all $10384$ publicly available bat recordings, on a standard Apple MacBook Air. The model is also lightweight with a small memory footprint of $144.09$\,MB of RAM usage. Hence, the low computational demands make the model ideal for use on a variety of standard personal devices with potential for deployment in the field via edge-processing devices. It is also competitively accurate, with up to $86\%$ precision on the dataset used to evaluate the model. In fact, we could not find a single case of disagreement between model and manual identification via expert field guides. Although a dataset of bat echolocation calls was chosen to demo this first-of-its-kind AI model, trained on only two representative calls, the model is not species specific. In conclusion, we propose an equitable AI model that has the potential to be a game changer for fast, lightweight, sustainable, transparent, explainable and accurate bioacoustic analysis.

Abstract: Existing post-hoc model-agnostic methods generate external explanations for opaque models, primarily by locally attributing the model output to its input features. However, they often lack an explicit and systematic framework for quantifying the contribution of individual features. Building on the Taylor expansion framework introduced by Deng et al. (2024) to unify existing local attribution methods, we propose a rigorous set of postulates -- "precision", "federation", and "zero-discrepancy" -- to govern Taylor term-specific attribution. Guided by these postulates, we introduce TaylorPODA (Taylor expansion-derived imPortance-Order aDapted Attribution), which incorporates an additional "adaptation" property. This property enables alignment with task-specific goals, especially in post-hoc settings lacking ground-truth explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TaylorPODA achieves competitive results against baseline methods, providing principled and visualization-friendly explanations. This work represents a step toward the trustworthy deployment of opaque models by offering explanations with stronger theoretical grounding.

Abstract: Programming assistants powered by large language models have transformed software development, yet most benchmarks focus narrowly on code generation tasks. Recent efforts like InfiBench and StackEval attempt to address this gap using Stack Overflow data but remain limited to single-turn interactions in isolated contexts, require significant manual curation, and fail to represent complete project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark framework for evaluating multi-turn programming assistance in realistic settings that address real-world questions about actual codebases. Unlike existing programming Q&amp;A benchmarks, CAB automatically generates scalable datasets from question-related GitHub issues using configurable parameters (e.g., repository creation date, star count, programming languages), and includes automatic containerization of codebases for evaluation. It then evaluates models through simulated users in these containerized environments with full codebase access. Using this framework, we constructed a test set of 3,286 real-world programming questions across 231 repositories, spanning seven programming languages and diverse problem domains. Our evaluation of leading LLMs reveals a substantial capability gap: while models perform well on Stack Overflow questions with success rates of 70-83%, they resolve only up to 16.49% of CAB's recent issues. This discrepancy highlights the challenges of providing assistance in complex, project-specific contexts versus answering standalone questions.

Abstract: A major challenge in the use of neural networks both for modeling human cognitive function and for artificial intelligence is the design of systems with the capacity to efficiently learn functions that support radical generalization. At the roots of this is the capacity to discover and implement symmetry functions. In this paper, we investigate a paradigmatic example of radical generalization through the use of symmetry: base addition. We present a group theoretic analysis of base addition, a fundamental and defining characteristic of which is the carry function -- the transfer of the remainder, when a sum exceeds the base modulus, to the next significant place. Our analysis exposes a range of alternative carry functions for a given base, and we introduce quantitative measures to characterize these. We then exploit differences in carry functions to probe the inductive biases of neural networks in symmetry learning, by training neural networks to carry out base addition using different carries, and comparing efficacy and rate of learning as a function of their structure. We find that even simple neural networks can achieve radical generalization with the right input format and carry function, and that learning speed is closely correlated with carry function structure. We then discuss the relevance this has for cognitive science and machine learning.

Abstract: Individuals are increasingly relying on large language model (LLM)-enabled conversational agents for emotional support. While prior research has examined privacy and security issues in chatbots specifically designed for mental health purposes, these chatbots are overwhelmingly "rule-based" offerings that do not leverage generative AI. Little empirical research currently measures users' privacy and security concerns, attitudes, and expectations when using general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots to manage and improve mental health. Through 21 semi-structured interviews with U.S. participants, we identified critical misconceptions and a general lack of risk awareness. Participants conflated the human-like empathy exhibited by LLMs with human-like accountability and mistakenly believed that their interactions with these chatbots were safeguarded by the same regulations (e.g., HIPAA) as disclosures with a licensed therapist. We introduce the concept of "intangible vulnerability," where emotional or psychological disclosures are undervalued compared to more tangible forms of information (e.g., financial or location-based data). To address this, we propose recommendations to safeguard user mental health disclosures with general-purpose LLM-enabled chatbots more effectively.

Abstract: Grounding language in complex perception (e.g. pixels) and action is a key challenge when building situated agents that can interact with humans via language. In past works, this is often solved via manual design of the language grounding or by curating massive datasets relating language to elements of the environment. We propose Ground-Compose-Reinforce, a neurosymbolic framework for grounding formal language from data, and eliciting behaviours by directly tasking RL agents through this language. By virtue of data-driven learning, our framework avoids the manual design of domain-specific elements like reward functions or symbol detectors. By virtue of compositional formal language semantics, our framework achieves data-efficient grounding and generalization to arbitrary language compositions. Experiments on an image-based gridworld and a MuJoCo robotics domain show that our approach reliably maps formal language instructions to behaviours with limited data while end-to-end, data-driven approaches fail.

<title>Auditing Facial Emotion Recognition Datasets for Posed Expressions and Racial Bias</title>

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) algorithms classify facial expressions into emotions such as happy, sad, or angry. An evaluative challenge facing FER algorithms is the fall in performance when detecting spontaneous expressions compared to posed expressions. An ethical (and evaluative) challenge facing FER algorithms is that they tend to perform poorly for people of some races and skin colors. These challenges are linked to the data collection practices employed in the creation of FER datasets. In this study, we audit two state-of-the-art FER datasets. We take random samples from each dataset and examine whether images are spontaneous or posed. In doing so, we propose a methodology for identifying spontaneous or posed images. We discover a significant number of images that were posed in the datasets purporting to consist of in-the-wild images. Since performance of FER models vary between spontaneous and posed images, the performance of models trained on these datasets will not represent the true performance if such models were to be deployed in in-the-wild applications. We also observe the skin color of individuals in the samples, and test three models trained on each of the datasets to predict facial expressions of people from various races and skin tones. We find that the FER models audited were more likely to predict people labeled as not white or determined to have dark skin as showing a negative emotion such as anger or sadness even when they were smiling. This bias makes such models prone to perpetuate harm in real life applications.

Abstract: Spacecraft deployed in outer space are routinely subjected to various forms of damage due to exposure to hazardous environments. In addition, there are significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the images. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 segmentation models to generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of 0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second. The dataset and models for performance benchmark are available at https://github.com/RiceD2KLab/SWiM.

Abstract: Spatial understanding has been a challenging task for existing Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs). Previous methods leverage large-scale MLLM finetuning to enhance MLLM's spatial understanding ability. In this paper, we present a data-efficient approach. We propose a LLM agent system with strong and advanced spatial reasoning ability, which can be used to solve the challenging spatial question answering task in complex indoor warehouse scenarios. Our system integrates multiple tools that allow the LLM agent to conduct spatial reasoning and API tools interaction to answer the given complicated spatial question. Extensive evaluations on the 2025 AI City Challenge Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset demonstrate that our system achieves high accuracy and efficiency in tasks such as object retrieval, counting, and distance estimation.

Abstract: Equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced sensing capabilities, social robots are gaining interest among consumers in the United States. These robots seem like a natural evolution of traditional smart home devices. However, their extensive data collection capabilities, anthropomorphic features, and capacity to interact with their environment make social robots a more significant security and privacy threat. Increased risks include data linkage, unauthorized data sharing, and the physical safety of users and their homes. It is critical to investigate U.S. users' security and privacy needs and concerns to guide the design of social robots while these devices are still in the early stages of commercialization in the U.S. market. Through 19 semi-structured interviews, we identified significant security and privacy concerns, highlighting the need for transparency, usability, and robust privacy controls to support adoption. For educational applications, participants worried most about misinformation, and in medical use cases, they worried about the reliability of these devices. Participants were also concerned with the data inference that social robots could enable. We found that participants expect tangible privacy controls, indicators of data collection, and context-appropriate functionality.

Turing introduced the Imitation Game as a way to explore the question: "Can machines think?" The Total Turing Test later expanded this concept beyond purely verbal communication, incorporating perceptual and physical interaction. Building on this, we propose a new guiding question: "Can machines react?" and introduce the React to This (RTT) test for nonverbal behaviors, presenting results from an initial experiment.

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that Semantic Context (SC), leveraging descriptive tool information, is a foundational component for robust tool orchestration. Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a theoretical foundation using contextual bandits, introducing SC-LinUCB and proving it achieves lower regret and adapts favourably in dynamic action spaces. Second, we provide parallel empirical validation with Large Language Models, showing that SC is critical for successful in-context learning in both static (efficient learning) and non-stationary (robust adaptation) settings. Third, we propose the FiReAct pipeline, and demonstrate on a benchmark with over 10,000 tools that SC-based retrieval enables an LLM to effectively orchestrate over a large action space. These findings provide a comprehensive guide to building more sample-efficient, adaptive, and scalable orchestration agents.

Abstract: Conversational agents, such as chatbots and virtual assistants, have become essential in software development, boosting productivity, collaboration, and automating various tasks. This paper examines the role of adaptive AI-powered conversational agents in software development, highlighting their ability to offer dynamic, context-aware assistance to developers. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, adaptive AI agents use machine learning and natural language processing to learn from interactions and improve over time, providing more personalized and responsive help. We look at how these tools have evolved from simple query-based systems to advanced AI-driven solutions like GitHub Copilot and Microsoft Teams bots. We also explore the challenges of integrating adaptive AI into software development processes. The study aims to assess the benefits and limitations of these systems, address concerns like data privacy and ethical issues, and offer insights into their future use in the field. Ultimately, adaptive AI chatbots have great potential to revolutionize software development by delivering real-time, customized support and enhancing the efficiency of development cycles.

Abstract: The SEN\'{C}OTEN language, spoken on the Saanich peninsula of southern Vancouver Island, is in the midst of vigorous language revitalization efforts to turn the tide of language loss as a result of colonial language policies. To support these on-the-ground efforts, the community is turning to digital technology. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technology holds great promise for accelerating language documentation and the creation of educational resources. However, developing ASR systems for SEN\'{C}OTEN is challenging due to limited data and significant vocabulary variation from its polysynthetic structure and stress-driven metathesis. To address these challenges, we propose an ASR-driven documentation pipeline that leverages augmented speech data from a text-to-speech (TTS) system and cross-lingual transfer learning with Speech Foundation Models (SFMs). An n-gram language model is also incorporated via shallow fusion or n-best restoring to maximize the use of available data. Experiments on the SEN\'{C}OTEN dataset show a word error rate (WER) of 19.34% and a character error rate (CER) of 5.09% on the test set with a 57.02% out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate. After filtering minor cedilla-related errors, WER improves to 14.32% (26.48% on unseen words) and CER to 3.45%, demonstrating the potential of our ASR-driven pipeline to support SEN\'{C}OTEN language documentation.

<title>Offline Reinforcement Learning with Wasserstein Regularization via Optimal Transport Maps</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn an optimal policy from a static dataset, making it particularly valuable in scenarios where data collection is costly, such as robotics. A major challenge in offline RL is distributional shift, where the learned policy deviates from the dataset distribution, potentially leading to unreliable out-of-distribution actions. To mitigate this issue, regularization techniques have been employed. While many existing methods utilize density ratio-based measures, such as the $f$-divergence, for regularization, we propose an approach that utilizes the Wasserstein distance, which is robust to out-of-distribution data and captures the similarity between actions. Our method employs input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to model optimal transport maps, enabling the computation of the Wasserstein distance in a discriminator-free manner, thereby avoiding adversarial training and ensuring stable learning. Our approach demonstrates comparable or superior performance to widely used existing methods on the D4RL benchmark dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/motokiomura/Q-DOT .

Abstract: Interpreting the decision-making process of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is critical for deploying models in high-stakes domains. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is a widely used method for visual explanations, yet it typically focuses on the final convolutional layer or na\"ively averages across layers, strategies that can obscure important semantic cues or amplify irrelevant noise. We propose Winsor-CAM, a novel, human-tunable extension of Grad-CAM that generates robust and coherent saliency maps by aggregating information across all convolutional layers. To mitigate the influence of noisy or extreme attribution values, Winsor-CAM applies Winsorization, a percentile-based outlier attenuation technique. A user-controllable threshold allows for semantic-level tuning, enabling flexible exploration of model behavior across representational hierarchies. Evaluations on standard architectures (ResNet50, DenseNet121, VGG16, InceptionV3) using the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that Winsor-CAM produces more interpretable heatmaps and achieves superior performance in localization metrics, including intersection-over-union and center-of-mass alignment, when compared to Grad-CAM and uniform layer-averaging baselines. Winsor-CAM advances the goal of trustworthy AI by offering interpretable, multi-layer insights with human-in-the-loop control.

Abstract: Phishing remains a pervasive and growing threat, inflicting heavy economic and reputational damage. While machine learning has been effective in real-time detection of phishing attacks, progress is hindered by lack of large, high-quality datasets and benchmarks. In addition to poor-quality due to challenges in data collection, existing datasets suffer from leakage and unrealistic base rates, leading to overly optimistic performance results. In this paper, we introduce PhreshPhish, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of phishing websites that addresses these limitations. Compared to existing public datasets, PhreshPhish is substantially larger and provides significantly higher quality, as measured by the estimated rate of invalid or mislabeled data points. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive suite of benchmark datasets specifically designed for realistic model evaluation by minimizing leakage, increasing task difficulty, enhancing dataset diversity, and adjustment of base rates more likely to be seen in the real world. We train and evaluate multiple solution approaches to provide baseline performance on the benchmark sets. We believe the availability of this dataset and benchmarks will enable realistic, standardized model comparison and foster further advances in phishing detection. The datasets and benchmarks are available on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/phreshphish/phreshphish).

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene. Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance, achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5 of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods, our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: This is the fourth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. In addition, this year we also leverage both the refreshed passage and document collections that were released last year leading to a nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage collection and nearly four times increase in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we mainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage retrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document ranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were inferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to previous years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods. Due to the focusing our judging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of this year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish between runs and reuse the dataset in future. We also see some surprises in overall outcomes. Some top-performing runs did not do dense retrieval. Runs that did single-stage dense retrieval were not as competitive this year as they were last year.

Abstract: AI models need to be unlearned to fulfill the requirements of legal acts such as the AI Act or GDPR, and also because of the need to remove toxic content, debiasing, the impact of malicious instances, or changes in the data distribution structure in which a model works. Unfortunately, removing knowledge may cause undesirable side effects, such as a deterioration in model performance. In this paper, we investigate the problem of adversarial unlearning, where a malicious party intentionally sends unlearn requests to deteriorate the model's performance maximally. We show that this phenomenon and the adversary's capabilities depend on many factors, primarily on the backbone model itself and strategy/limitations in selecting data to be unlearned. The main result of this work is a new method of protecting model performance from these side effects, both in the case of unlearned behavior resulting from spontaneous processes and adversary actions.

Abstract: Recently, AI-based weather forecast models have achieved impressive advances. These models have reached accuracy levels comparable to traditional NWP systems, marking a significant milestone in data-driven weather prediction. However, they mostly leverage Transformer-based architectures, which often leads to high training complexity and resource demands due to the massive parameter sizes. In this study, we introduce a modernized CNN-based model for global weather forecasting that delivers competitive accuracy while significantly reducing computational requirements. To present a systematic modernization roadmap, we highlight key architectural enhancements across multiple design scales from an earlier CNN-based approach. KAI-a incorporates a scale-invariant architecture and InceptionNeXt-based blocks within a geophysically-aware design, tailored to the structure of Earth system data. Trained on the ERA5 daily dataset with 67 atmospheric variables, the model contains about 7 million parameters and completes training in just 12 hours on a single NVIDIA L40s GPU. Our evaluation shows that KAI-a matches the performance of state-of-the-art models in medium-range weather forecasting, while offering a significantly lightweight design. Furthermore, case studies on the 2018 European heatwave and the East Asian summer monsoon demonstrate KAI-a's robust skill in capturing extreme events, reinforcing its practical utility.

arXiv:2507.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency. Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second, highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: The growing complexity of cyber threats and the limitations of traditional vulnerability detection tools necessitate novel approaches for securing software systems. We introduce MalCodeAI, a language-agnostic, multi-stage AI pipeline for autonomous code security analysis and remediation. MalCodeAI combines code decomposition and semantic reasoning using fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct models, optimized through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) within the MLX framework, and delivers scalable, accurate results across 14 programming languages. In Phase 1, the model achieved a validation loss as low as 0.397 for functional decomposition and summarization of code segments after 200 iterations, 6 trainable layers, and a learning rate of 2 x 10^(-5). In Phase 2, for vulnerability detection and remediation, it achieved a best validation loss of 0.199 using the same number of iterations and trainable layers but with an increased learning rate of 4 x 10^(-5), effectively identifying security flaws and suggesting actionable fixes. MalCodeAI supports red-hat-style exploit tracing, CVSS-based risk scoring, and zero-shot generalization to detect complex, zero-day vulnerabilities. In a qualitative evaluation involving 15 developers, the system received high scores in usefulness (mean 8.06/10), interpretability (mean 7.40/10), and readability of outputs (mean 7.53/10), confirming its practical value in real-world development workflows. This work marks a significant advancement toward intelligent, explainable, and developer-centric software security solutions.

<title>Class-Proportional Coreset Selection for Difficulty-Separable Data</title>

Abstract: High-quality training data is essential for building reliable and efficient machine learning systems. One-shot coreset selection addresses this by pruning the dataset while maintaining or even improving model performance, often relying on training-dynamics-based data difficulty scores. However, most existing methods implicitly assume class-wise homogeneity in data difficulty, overlooking variation in data difficulty across different classes.
  In this work, we challenge this assumption by showing that, in domains such as network intrusion detection and medical imaging, data difficulty often clusters by class. We formalize this as class-difficulty separability and introduce the Class Difficulty Separability Coefficient (CDSC) as a quantitative measure. We demonstrate that high CDSC values correlate with performance degradation in class-agnostic coreset methods, which tend to overrepresent easy majority classes while neglecting rare but informative ones.
  To address this, we introduce class-proportional variants of multiple sampling strategies. Evaluated on five diverse datasets spanning security and medical domains, our methods consistently achieve state-of-the-art data efficiency. For instance, on CTU-13, at an extreme 99% pruning rate, a class-proportional variant of Coverage-centric Coreset Selection (CCS-CP) shows remarkable stability, with accuracy dropping only 2.58%, precision 0.49%, and recall 0.19%. In contrast, the class-agnostic CCS baseline, the next best method, suffers sharper declines of 7.59% in accuracy, 4.57% in precision, and 4.11% in recall.
  We further show that aggressive pruning enhances generalization in noisy, imbalanced, and large-scale datasets. Our results underscore that explicitly modeling class-difficulty separability leads to more effective, robust, and generalizable data pruning, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.

<title>HanjaBridge: Resolving Semantic Ambiguity in Korean LLMs via Hanja-Augmented Pre-Training</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often show poor performance in low-resource languages like Korean, partly due to unique linguistic challenges such as homophonous Sino-Korean words that are indistinguishable in Hangul script. To address this semantic ambiguity, we propose HanjaBridge, a novel meaning-injection technique integrated into a continual pre-training (CPT) framework. Instead of deterministically mapping a word to a single Hanja (Chinese character), HanjaBridge presents the model with all possible Hanja candidates for a given homograph, encouraging the model to learn contextual disambiguation. This process is paired with token-level knowledge distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results show that HanjaBridge significantly improves Korean language understanding, achieving a 21\% relative improvement on the KoBALT benchmark. Notably, by reinforcing semantic alignment between Korean and Chinese through shared Hanja, we observe a strong positive cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, these gains persist even when Hanja augmentation is omitted at inference time, ensuring practical efficiency with no additional run-time cost.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore how large language models (LLMs) approach financial decision-making by systematically comparing their responses to those of human participants across the globe. We posed a set of commonly used financial decision-making questions to seven leading LLMs, including five models from the GPT series(GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, o1, o3-mini), Gemini 2.0 Flash, and DeepSeek R1. We then compared their outputs to human responses drawn from a dataset covering 53 nations. Our analysis reveals three main results. First, LLMs generally exhibit a risk-neutral decision-making pattern, favoring choices aligned with expected value calculations when faced with lottery-type questions. Second, when evaluating trade-offs between present and future, LLMs occasionally produce responses that appear inconsistent with normative reasoning. Third, when we examine cross-national similarities, we find that the LLMs' aggregate responses most closely resemble those of participants from Tanzania. These findings contribute to the understanding of how LLMs emulate human-like decision behaviors and highlight potential cultural and training influences embedded within their outputs.

Abstract: The complete connectome of the Drosophila larva brain offers a unique opportunity to investigate whether biologically evolved circuits can support artificial intelligence. We convert this wiring diagram into a Biological Processing Unit (BPU), a fixed recurrent network derived directly from synaptic connectivity. Despite its modest size 3,000 neurons and 65,000 weights between them), the unmodified BPU achieves 98% accuracy on MNIST and 58% on CIFAR-10, surpassing size-matched MLPs. Scaling the BPU via structured connectome expansions further improves CIFAR-10 performance, while modality-specific ablations reveal the uneven contributions of different sensory subsystems. On the ChessBench dataset, a lightweight GNN-BPU model trained on only 10,000 games achieves 60% move accuracy, nearly 10x better than any size transformer. Moreover, CNN-BPU models with ~2M parameters outperform parameter-matched Transformers, and with a depth-6 minimax search at inference, reach 91.7% accuracy, exceeding even a 9M-parameter Transformer baseline. These results demonstrate the potential of biofidelic neural architectures to support complex cognitive tasks and motivate scaling to larger and more intelligent connectomes in future work.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought them closer to matching human cognition across a variety of tasks. How well do these models align with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research has shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack robust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the current study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human performance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in LLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity between the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity between the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the effectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we examine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in humans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and not just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our experiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters) and performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as GPT-4 and LLaMA3. This work advances our understanding of the analogical reasoning abilities of LLMs and their potential as models of human reasoning.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection is essential for accurately localizing and characterizing interactions between humans and objects, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex visual scenes across various domains. However, existing HOI detectors often struggle to deliver reliable predictions efficiently, relying on resource-intensive training methods and inefficient architectures. To address these challenges, we conceptualize a wavelet attention-like backbone and a novel ray-based encoder architecture tailored for HOI detection. Our wavelet backbone addresses the limitations of expressing middle-order interactions by aggregating discriminative features from the low- and high-order interactions extracted from diverse convolutional filters. Concurrently, the ray-based encoder facilitates multi-scale attention by optimizing the focus of the decoder on relevant regions of interest and mitigating computational overhead. As a result of harnessing the attenuated intensity of learnable ray origins, our decoder aligns query embeddings with emphasized regions of interest for accurate predictions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and HICO-DET, showcase the potential of our proposed architecture. The code is publicly available at [https://github.com/henry-pay/RayEncoder].

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for detecting mispronunciations by analyzing deviations between a user's original speech and their voice-cloned counterpart with corrected pronunciation. We hypothesize that regions with maximal acoustic deviation between the original and cloned utterances indicate potential mispronunciations. Our method leverages recent advances in voice cloning to generate a synthetic version of the user's voice with proper pronunciation, then performs frame-by-frame comparisons to identify problematic segments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in pinpointing specific pronunciation errors without requiring predefined phonetic rules or extensive training data for each target language.

Abstract: Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) workloads often requires distributing environment simulation across compute clusters. Existing frameworks entangle simulation, learning logic, and orchestration into monolithic systems, limiting modularity and reusability. We present ClusterEnv, a lightweight, learner-agnostic interface for distributed environment execution that mirrors the Gymnasium API. ClusterEnv introduces the DETACH pattern, which decouples simulation from training by offloading reset() and step() operations to remote workers while keeping learning centralized. To address policy staleness in distributed execution, we propose Adaptive Actor Policy Synchronization (AAPS), a divergence-triggered update mechanism that reduces synchronization overhead without sacrificing performance. ClusterEnv integrates cleanly into existing RL pipelines, supports both on-policy and off-policy methods, and requires minimal code changes. Experiments on discrete control tasks demonstrate that AAPS achieves high sample efficiency with significantly fewer weight updates. Source code is available at https://github.com/rodlaf/ClusterEnv.

Abstract: Reward functions, learned or manually specified, are rarely perfect. Instead of accurately expressing human goals, these reward functions are often distorted by human beliefs about how best to achieve those goals. Specifically, these reward functions often express a combination of the human's terminal goals -- those which are ends in themselves -- and the human's instrumental goals -- those which are means to an end. We formulate a simple example in which even slight conflation of instrumental and terminal goals results in severe misalignment: optimizing the misspecified reward function results in poor performance when measured by the true reward function. This example distills the essential properties of environments that make reinforcement learning highly sensitive to conflation of instrumental and terminal goals. We discuss how this issue can arise with a common approach to reward learning and how it can manifest in real environments.

<title>Crafting Imperceptible On-Manifold Adversarial Attacks for Tabular Data</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on tabular data present fundamental challenges distinct from image or text domains due to the heterogeneous nature of mixed categorical and numerical features. Unlike images where pixel perturbations maintain visual similarity, tabular data lacks intuitive similarity metrics, making it difficult to define imperceptible modifications. Additionally, traditional gradient-based methods prioritise $\ell_p$-norm constraints, often producing adversarial examples that deviate from the original data distributions, making them detectable. We propose a latent space perturbation framework using a mixed-input Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate imperceptible adversarial examples. The proposed VAE integrates categorical embeddings and numerical features into a unified latent manifold, enabling perturbations that preserve statistical consistency. We specify In-Distribution Success Rate (IDSR) to measure the proportion of adversarial examples that remain statistically indistinguishable from the input distribution. Evaluation across six publicly available datasets and three model architectures demonstrates that our method achieves substantially lower outlier rates and more consistent performance compared to traditional input-space attacks and other VAE-based methods adapted from image domain approaches. Our comprehensive analysis includes hyperparameter sensitivity, sparsity control mechanisms, and generative architectural comparisons, revealing that VAE-based attacks depend critically on reconstruction quality but offer superior practical utility when sufficient training data is available. This work highlights the importance of on-manifold perturbations for realistic adversarial attacks on tabular data, offering a robust approach for practical deployment.

Abstract: The resurgence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in visual recognition tasks, exemplified by ConvNeXt, has demonstrated their capability to rival transformer-based architectures through advanced training methodologies and ViT-inspired design principles. However, both CNNs and transformers exhibit a simplicity bias, favoring straightforward features over complex structural representations. Furthermore, modern CNNs often integrate MLP-like blocks akin to those in transformers, but these blocks suffer from significant information redundancies, necessitating high expansion ratios to sustain competitive performance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRTAN, a lightweight architectural design that enhances spatial and channel-wise information processing. SpaRTAN employs kernels with varying receptive fields, controlled by kernel size and dilation factor, to capture discriminative multi-order spatial features effectively. A wave-based channel aggregation module further modulates and reinforces pixel interactions, mitigating channel-wise redundancies. Combining the two modules, the proposed network can efficiently gather and dynamically contextualize discriminative features. Experimental results in ImageNet and COCO demonstrate that SpaRTAN achieves remarkable parameter efficiency while maintaining competitive performance. In particular, on the ImageNet-1k benchmark, SpaRTAN achieves 77. 7% accuracy with only 3.8M parameters and approximately 1.0 GFLOPs, demonstrating its ability to deliver strong performance through an efficient design. On the COCO benchmark, it achieves 50.0% AP, surpassing the previous benchmark by 1.2% with only 21.5M parameters. The code is publicly available at [https://github.com/henry-pay/SpaRTAN].

Abstract: Recent advances in automated radiology report generation from chest X-rays using deep learning algorithms have the potential to significantly reduce the arduous workload of radiologists. However, due to the inherent massive data bias in radiology images, where abnormalities are typically subtle and sparsely distributed, existing methods often produce fluent yet medically inaccurate reports, limiting their applicability in clinical practice. To address this issue effectively, we propose a Semantically Informed Salient Regions-guided (SISRNet) report generation method. Specifically, our approach explicitly identifies salient regions with medically critical characteristics using fine-grained cross-modal semantics. Then, SISRNet systematically focuses on these high-information regions during both image modeling and report generation, effectively capturing subtle abnormal findings, mitigating the negative impact of data bias, and ultimately generating clinically accurate reports. Compared to its peers, SISRNet demonstrates superior performance on widely used IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

<title>First-Order Error Matters: Accurate Compensation for Quantized Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) offers an efficient approach to compressing large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing memory access and computational costs. Existing compensation-based weight calibration methods often rely on a second-order Taylor expansion to model quantization error, under the assumption that the first-order term is negligible in well-trained full-precision models. However, we reveal that the progressive compensation process introduces accumulated first-order deviations between latent weights and their full-precision counterparts, making this assumption fundamentally flawed. To address this, we propose FOEM, a novel PTQ method that explicitly incorporates first-order gradient terms to improve quantization error compensation. FOEM approximates gradients by directly computing the difference between latent and full-precision weights, avoiding the high cost and limited generalization of backpropagation-based gradient computation. This approach introduces minimal additional computational overhead. Moreover, FOEM leverages precomputed Cholesky factors to efficiently recover the inverse of Hessian submatrices in real time. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models and benchmarks demonstrate that FOEM consistently outperforms the classical GPTQ method. In 3-bit weight-only quantization, FOEM reduces the perplexity of Llama3-8B by 89.6%, and improves the 5-shot MMLU accuracy of Llama3-70B from 51.7% to 74.9%, approaching the full-precision performance of 78.6%. Furthermore, FOEM can be seamlessly integrated with advanced techniques such as GPTAQ and SpinQuant, yielding additional improvements under the challenging W4A4KV4 setting, and further narrowing the accuracy gap with full-precision baselines beyond what current state-of-the-art methods achieve. The code is available at https://github.com/Xingyu-Zheng/FOEM.

Abstract: Timely identification and accurate risk stratification of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remain essential for reducing global mortality. While existing prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning, prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity, which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification. This work underscores the potential of LLMs in clinical decision support systems (CDSS), advancing early warning systems and enhancing the translation of patient narratives into actionable risk assessments.

Abstract: Accurate indoor localization is crucial for enabling spatial context in smart environments and navigation systems. Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprinting is a widely used indoor localization approach due to its compatibility with mobile embedded devices. Deep Learning (DL) models improve accuracy in localization tasks by learning RSS variations across locations, but they assume fingerprint vectors exist in a Euclidean space, failing to incorporate spatial relationships and the non-uniform distribution of real-world RSS noise. This results in poor generalization across heterogeneous mobile devices, where variations in hardware and signal processing distort RSS readings. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can improve upon conventional DL models by encoding indoor locations as nodes and modeling their spatial and signal relationships as edges. However, GNNs struggle with non-Euclidean noise distributions and suffer from the GNN blind spot problem, leading to degraded accuracy in environments with dense access points (APs). To address these challenges, we propose GATE, a novel framework that constructs an adaptive graph representation of fingerprint vectors while preserving an indoor state-space topology, modeling the non-Euclidean structure of RSS noise to mitigate environmental noise and address device heterogeneity. GATE introduces 1) a novel Attention Hyperspace Vector (AHV) for enhanced message passing, 2) a novel Multi-Dimensional Hyperspace Vector (MDHV) to mitigate the GNN blind spot, and 3) an new Real-Time Edge Construction (RTEC) approach for dynamic graph adaptation. Extensive real-world evaluations across multiple indoor spaces with varying path lengths, AP densities, and heterogeneous devices demonstrate that GATE achieves 1.6x to 4.72x lower mean localization errors and 1.85x to 4.57x lower worst-case errors compared to state-of-the-art indoor localization frameworks.

Recent studies have uncovered severe data contamination issues, e.g. SWE-bench reports 32.67% of successful patches involve direct solution leakage and 31.08\% pass due to inadequate test cases. We introduce SWE-MERA, a dynamic, continuously updated benchmark designed to address these fundamental challenges through an automated collection of real-world GitHub issues and rigorous quality validation. Our approach implements a reliable pipeline that ensures quality while minimizing contamination risks, resulting in approximately 10,000 potential tasks with 300 samples currently available. Evaluation using the Aider coding agent demonstrates strong discriminative power in state-of-the-art models. We report performance across a dozen recent LLMs evaluated on tasks collected between September 2024 and June 2025.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However, achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction (3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local 3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

Abstract: Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS), which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.

Abstract: Log anomaly detection using traditional rule based or deep learning based methods is often challenging due to the large volume and highly complex nature of log sequence. So effective way of detection of anomalous sequence of logs is crucial for system maintenance and development. This paper proposes parameter efficient finetuning specifically low rank adaptation (LoRA) and adapter based approaches for finding contextual anomalies in sequence of logs in large log data set. It compares different tiny large language models (LLMs) on the Thunderbird dataset. The results show that LoRA based finetuning provides substantial performance improvements of 18 to 19 percentage over LogBert based full finetuning approach, achieving accuracy scores between 97.76% and 98.83% compared to 79.37%.

Abstract: Marker-free human pose estimation (HPE) has found increasing applications in various fields. Current HPE suffers from occasional errors in keypoint recognition and random fluctuation in keypoint trajectories when analyzing kinematic human poses. The performance of existing deep learning-based models for HPE refinement is considerably limited by inaccurate training datasets in which the keypoints are manually annotated. This paper proposed a novel method to overcome the difficulty through joint angle-based modeling. The key techniques include: (i) A joint angle-based model of human pose, which is robust to describe kinematic human poses; (ii) Approximating temporal variation of joint angles through high order Fourier series to get reliable "ground truth"; (iii) A bidirectional recurrent network is designed as a post-processing module to refine the estimation of well-established HRNet. Trained with the high-quality dataset constructed using our method, the network demonstrates outstanding performance to correct wrongly recognized joints and smooth their spatiotemporal trajectories. Tests show that joint angle-based refinement (JAR) outperforms the state-of-the-art HPE refinement network in challenging cases like figure skating and breaking.

Abstract: Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has become a rapid and non-destructive solution for road subsurface distress (RSD) detection. However, RSD recognition from GPR images is labor-intensive and heavily relies on inspectors' expertise. Deep learning offers the possibility for automatic RSD recognition, but its current performance is limited by two factors: Scarcity of high-quality dataset for network training and insufficient capability of network to distinguish RSD. In this study, a rigorously validated 3D GPR dataset containing 2134 samples of diverse types was constructed through field scanning. Based on the finding that the YOLO model trained with one of the three scans of GPR images exhibits varying sensitivity to specific type of RSD, we proposed a novel cross-verification strategy with outstanding accuracy in RSD recognition, achieving recall over 98.6% in field tests. The approach, integrated into an online RSD detection system, can reduce the labor of inspection by around 90%.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate leveraging cross-attention control for efficient audio editing within auto-regressive models. Inspired by image editing methodologies, we develop a Prompt-to-Prompt-like approach that guides edits through cross and self-attention mechanisms. Integrating a diffusion-based strategy, influenced by Auffusion, we extend the model's functionality to support refinement edits, establishing a baseline for prompt-guided audio editing. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach by incorporating MUSICGEN, a pre-trained frozen auto-regressive model, and propose three editing mechanisms, based on Replacement, Reweighting, and Refinement of the attention scores. We employ commonly-used music-specific evaluation metrics and a human study, to gauge time-varying controllability, adherence to global text cues, and overall audio realism. The automatic and human evaluations indicate that the proposed combination of prompt-to-prompt guidance with autoregressive generation models significantly outperforms the diffusion-based baseline in terms of melody, dynamics, and tempo of the generated audio.

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multimodal cues to understand and interact with the environment. Learning a scene representation for multiple modalities enhances comprehension of the physical world. However, modality conflicts, arising from inherent distinctions among different modalities, present two critical challenges: property disparity and granularity disparity. To address these challenges, we propose a general framework, MMOne, to represent multiple modalities in one scene, which can be readily extended to additional modalities. Specifically, a modality modeling module with a novel modality indicator is proposed to capture the unique properties of each modality. Additionally, we design a multimodal decomposition mechanism to separate multi-modal Gaussians into single-modal Gaussians based on modality differences. We address the essential distinctions among modalities by disentangling multimodal information into shared and modality-specific components, resulting in a more compact and efficient multimodal scene representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently enhances the representation capability for each modality and is scalable to additional modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/Neal2020GitHub/MMOne.

<title>Latent Space Consistency for Sparse-View CT Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely utilized imaging modality in clinical settings. Using densely acquired rotational X-ray arrays, CT can capture 3D spatial features. However, it is confronted with challenged such as significant time consumption and high radiation exposure. CT reconstruction methods based on sparse-view X-ray images have garnered substantial attention from researchers as they present a means to mitigate costs and risks. In recent years, diffusion models, particularly the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), have demonstrated promising potential in the domain of 3D CT reconstruction. Nonetheless, due to the substantial differences between the 2D latent representation of X-ray modalities and the 3D latent representation of CT modalities, the vanilla LDM is incapable of achieving effective alignment within the latent space. To address this issue, we propose the Consistent Latent Space Diffusion Model (CLS-DM), which incorporates cross-modal feature contrastive learning to efficiently extract latent 3D information from 2D X-ray images and achieve latent space alignment between modalities. Experimental results indicate that CLS-DM outperforms classical and state-of-the-art generative models in terms of standard voxel-level metrics (PSNR, SSIM) on the LIDC-IDRI and CTSpine1K datasets. This methodology not only aids in enhancing the effectiveness and economic viability of sparse X-ray reconstructed CT but can also be generalized to other cross-modal transformation tasks, such as text-to-image synthesis. We have made our code publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CLS-DM-50D6/ to facilitate further research and applications in other domains.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of large vision-language models, the capacity for color vision in these models is crucial. However, the color vision abilities of large visual-language models have not yet been thoroughly explored. To address this gap, we define a color vision testing task for large vision-language models and construct a dataset \footnote{Anonymous Github Showing some of the data https://anonymous.4open.science/r/color-vision-test-dataset-3BCD} that covers multiple categories of test questions and tasks of varying difficulty levels. Furthermore, we analyze the types of errors made by large vision-language models and propose fine-tuning strategies to enhance their performance in color vision tests.

Abstract: The increasing need for robustness, reliability, and determinism in wireless networks for industrial and mission-critical applications is the driver for the growth of new innovative methods. The study presented in this work makes use of machine learning techniques to predict channel quality in a Wi-Fi network in terms of the frame delivery ratio. Predictions can be used proactively to adjust communication parameters at runtime and optimize network operations for industrial applications. Methods including convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory were analyzed on datasets acquired from a real Wi-Fi setup across multiple channels. The models were compared in terms of prediction accuracy and computational complexity. Results show that the frame delivery ratio can be reliably predicted, and convolutional neural networks, although slightly less effective than other models, are more efficient in terms of CPU usage and memory consumption. This enhances the model's usability on embedded and industrial systems.

<title>Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality</title>

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, various neural network-based Granger causality models have been proposed. Although these models have demonstrated notable improvements, several limitations remain. Most existing approaches adopt the component-wise architecture, necessitating the construction of a separate model for each time series, which results in substantial computational costs. In addition, imposing the sparsity-inducing penalty on the first-layer weights of the neural network to extract causal relationships weakens the model's ability to capture complex interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Gradient Regularization-based Neural Granger Causality (GRNGC), which requires only one time series prediction model and applies $L_{1}$ regularization to the gradient between model's input and output to infer Granger causality. Moreover, GRNGC is not tied to a specific time series forecasting model and can be implemented with diverse architectures such as KAN, MLP, and LSTM, offering enhanced flexibility. Numerical simulations on DREAM, Lorenz-96, fMRI BOLD, and CausalTime show that GRNGC outperforms existing baselines and significantly reduces computational overhead. Meanwhile, experiments on real-world DNA, Yeast, HeLa, and bladder urothelial carcinoma datasets further validate the model's effectiveness in reconstructing gene regulatory networks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture in large language models, highlighting its ability to significantly enhance model performance while maintaining minimal computational overhead. Through a systematic analysis spanning theoretical foundations, core architectural designs, and large language model (LLM) applications, we examine expert gating and routing mechanisms, hierarchical and sparse MoE configurations, meta-learning approaches, multimodal and multitask learning scenarios, real-world deployment cases, and recent advances and challenges in deep learning. Our analysis identifies key advantages of MoE, including superior model capacity compared to equivalent Bayesian approaches, improved task-specific performance, and the ability to scale model capacity efficiently. We also underscore the importance of ensuring expert diversity, accurate calibration, and reliable inference aggregation, as these are essential for maximizing the effectiveness of MoE architectures. Finally, this review outlines current research limitations, open challenges, and promising future directions, providing a foundation for continued innovation in MoE architecture and its applications.

Abstract: Heart disease remains a major global health concern, particularly in regions with limited access to medical resources and diagnostic facilities. Traditional diagnostic methods often fail to accurately identify and manage heart disease risks, leading to adverse outcomes. Machine learning has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and speed of heart disease diagnosis. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive framework that combines classification models for heart disease detection and regression models for risk prediction. We employed the Heart Disease dataset, which comprises 1,035 cases. To address the issue of class imbalance, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, resulting in the generation of an additional 100,000 synthetic data points. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, R2, MSE, RMSE, and MAE, were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness. Among the classification models, Random Forest emerged as the standout performer, achieving an accuracy of 97.2% on real data and 97.6% on synthetic data. For regression tasks, Linear Regression demonstrated the highest R2 values of 0.992 and 0.984 on real and synthetic datasets, respectively, with the lowest error metrics. Additionally, Explainable AI techniques were employed to enhance the interpretability of the models. This study highlights the potential of machine learning to revolutionize heart disease diagnosis and risk prediction, thereby facilitating early intervention and enhancing clinical decision-making.

<title>Temperature and Persona Shape LLM Agent Consensus With Minimal Accuracy Gains in Qualitative Coding</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable new possibilities for qualitative research at scale, including coding and data annotation. While multi-agent systems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over single-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental study of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding accuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source MAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and consensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion parameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding decisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from online math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and when consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas (including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus in four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs, higher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas on consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust improvements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS consensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code category showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was 0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive persona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations suggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications that could improve codebooks and human-AI coding. We contribute new insight into the limits of LLM-based qualitative methods, challenging the notion that diverse MAS personas lead to better outcomes. We open-source our MAS and experimentation code.

<title>Role-Playing LLM-Based Multi-Agent Support Framework for Detecting and Addressing Family Communication Bias</title>

Abstract: Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that conventional metrics often overlook. In particular, unconscious parental expectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional expression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion, often stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is difficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these latent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support for psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese parent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on ideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a Role-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes dialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion, describe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual attributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these outputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert agents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable feedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show that the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate accuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality. Moreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited signs of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the framework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family interactions.

Abstract: Finite-State Machines (FSMs) are critical for modeling the operational logic of network protocols, enabling verification, analysis, and vulnerability discovery. However, existing FSM extraction techniques face limitations such as scalability, incomplete coverage, and ambiguity in natural language specifications. In this paper, we propose FlowFSM, a novel agentic framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with prompt chaining and chain-of-thought reasoning to extract accurate FSMs from raw RFC documents. FlowFSM systematically processes protocol specifications, identifies state transitions, and constructs structured rule-books by chaining agent outputs. Experimental evaluation across FTP and RTSP protocols demonstrates that FlowFSM achieves high extraction precision while minimizing hallucinated transitions, showing promising results. Our findings highlight the potential of agent-based LLM systems in the advancement of protocol analysis and FSM inference for cybersecurity and reverse engineering applications.

Abstract: Automatic Target Detection (ATD) and Recognition (ATR) from Thermal Infrared (TI) imagery in the defense and surveillance domain is a challenging computer vision (CV) task in comparison to the commercial autonomous vehicle perception domain. Limited datasets, peculiar domain-specific and TI modality-specific challenges, i.e., limited hardware, scale invariance issues due to greater distances, deliberate occlusion by tactical vehicles, lower sensor resolution and resultant lack of structural information in targets, effects of weather, temperature, and time of day variations, and varying target to clutter ratios all result in increased intra-class variability and higher inter-class similarity, making accurate real-time ATR a challenging CV task. Resultantly, contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning architectures underperform in the ATR domain. We propose a modified anchor-based single-stage detector, called YOLOatr, based on a modified YOLOv5s, with optimal modifications to the detection heads, feature fusion in the neck, and a custom augmentation profile. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on a comprehensive DSIAC MWIR dataset for real-time ATR over both correlated and decorrelated testing protocols. The results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art ATR performance of up to 99.6%.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents excel in solving complex decision-making tasks across various domains. However, they often require a substantial number of training steps and a vast experience replay buffer, leading to significant computational and resource demands. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel theoretical result that leverages the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework into DRL. Unlike most methods that focus on bounding the counterfactual loss, we establish a causal bound on the factual loss, which is analogous to the on-policy loss in DRL. This bound is computed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer, effectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments across the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and SAC, achieve up to 2,427% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents without our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up to 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at negligible cost.

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values has attracted increasing attention since it provides clarity, transparency, and the ability to adapt to evolving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a Controlled Value Vector Activation (ConVA) method that directly aligns the internal values of LLMs by interpreting how a value is encoded in their latent representations and modifies relevant activations to ensure consistent values in LLMs. To ensure an accurate and unbiased interpretation, we propose a context-controlled value vector identification method. To consistently control values without sacrificing model performance, we introduce a gated value vector activation method for effective and minimum degree of value control. Experiments show that our method achieves the highest control success rate across 10 basic values without hurting LLM performance and fluency, and ensures target values even with opposite and potentially malicious input prompts. Source code and data are available at~ https://github.com/hr-jin/ConVA.

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the 3D-IRCADb-01 dataset obtains an average Dice of 87.45%, IoU of 80.30%, ASSD of 1.525 mm, and VOE of 19.71%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Traditional approaches for molecular imaging of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo require radioactive isotopes, lengthy scan times, or deliver only low spatial resolution. Recent advances in saturation transfer-based PD magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have provided biochemical insights, although the image contrast is semi-quantitative and nonspecific. Here, we combined a rapid molecular MRI acquisition paradigm with deep learning based reconstruction for multi-metabolite quantification of glutamate, mobile proteins, semisolid, and mobile macromolecules in an acute MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model. The quantitative parameter maps are in general agreement with the histology and MR spectroscopy, and demonstrate that semisolid magnetization transfer (MT), amide, and aliphatic relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE) proton volume fractions may serve as PD biomarkers.

Abstract: Novelty is a crucial criterion in the peer review process for evaluating academic papers. Traditionally, it's judged by experts or measure by unique reference combinations. Both methods have limitations: experts have limited knowledge, and the effectiveness of the combination method is uncertain. Moreover, it's unclear if unique citations truly measure novelty. The large language model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts possess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our research integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to address the limitations of novelty assessment. The most common novelty in academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper, we propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language models (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers. Specifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper from peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of the academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have designed a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better integrate human and LLM knowledge. We compared the method we proposed with a large number of baselines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance.

<title>SystolicAttention: Fusing FlashAttention within a Single Systolic Array</title>

Abstract: Transformer models rely heavily on scaled dot-product attention (SDPA), typically implemented using the FlashAttention algorithm. However, current systolic-array-based accelerators face significant challenges when executing FlashAttention. Systolic arrays can only achieve high utilization for consecutive and large matrix multiplications. In contrast, FlashAttention requires frequently interleaved matrix multiplications and softmax operations.
  The frequent data swaps between the systolic array and external vector units result in low systolic array utilization. This is further exacerbated by the fact that softmax involves numerous non-matrix operations, which are not well-suited for systolic arrays. Moreover, the concurrent execution of matrix multiplication on systolic arrays and softmax on vector units leads to register file and SRAM port contention, further degrading performance.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose FSA, an enhanced systolic array architecture that enables the entire FlashAttention algorithm to run entirely within a single systolic array, eliminating the need for external vector units. At the core of FSA is SystolicAttention, a novel scheduling algorithm that maps FlashAttention operations onto systolic arrays with fine-grained, element-wise overlap. This significantly improves array utilization while preserving the original floating-point operation order to maintain numerical stability.
  We implement FSA in synthesizable RTL and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art commercial accelerators. Our results show that FSA achieves 1.77x and 4.83x higher attention FLOPs/s utilization compared to AWS NeuronCore-v2 and Google TPUv5e, respectively, with only about 10% area overhead.

We implement RAE+UPOM on a mobile manipulator in a real-world deployment for an object collection task. Our experiments demonstrate robust task execution under action failures and sensor noise, and provide empirical insights into the interleaved acting-and-planning decision making process.

Abstract: Training neural networks with reinforcement learning (RL) typically relies on backpropagation (BP), necessitating storage of activations from the forward pass for subsequent backward updates. Furthermore, backpropagating error signals through multiple layers often leads to vanishing or exploding gradients, which can degrade learning performance and stability. We propose a novel approach that trains each layer of the neural network using local signals during the forward pass in RL settings. Our approach introduces local, layer-wise losses leveraging the principle of matching pairwise distances from multi-dimensional scaling, enhanced with optional reward-driven guidance. This method allows each hidden layer to be trained using local signals computed during forward propagation, thus eliminating the need for backward passes and storing intermediate activations. Our experiments, conducted with policy gradient methods across common RL benchmarks, demonstrate that this backpropagation-free method achieves competitive performance compared to their classical BP-based counterpart. Additionally, the proposed method enhances stability and consistency within and across runs, and improves performance especially in challenging environments.

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) tasks have made significant progress with the advent of Deep Neural Networks, particularly through margin-based triplet losses that embed facial images into high-dimensional feature spaces. During training, these contrastive losses focus exclusively on identity information as labels. However, we observe a multiscale geometric structure emerging in the embedding space, influenced by interpretable facial (e.g., hair color) and image attributes (e.g., contrast). We propose a geometric approach to describe the dependence or invariance of FR models to these attributes and introduce a physics-inspired alignment metric. We evaluate the proposed metric on controlled, simplified models and widely used FR models fine-tuned with synthetic data for targeted attribute augmentation. Our findings reveal that the models exhibit varying degrees of invariance across different attributes, providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses and enabling deeper interpretability.

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate divergence measure is a critical aspect of machine learning, as it directly impacts model performance. Among the most widely used, we find the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, originally introduced in kinetic theory as a measure of relative entropy between probability distributions. Just as in machine learning, the ability to quantify the proximity of probability distributions plays a central role in kinetic theory. In this paper, we present a comparative review of divergence measures rooted in kinetic theory, highlighting their theoretical foundations and exploring their potential applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought traces have been shown to improve performance of large language models in a plethora of reasoning tasks, yet there is no consensus on the mechanism through which this performance boost is achieved. To shed more light on this, we introduce Causal CoT Graphs (CCGs), which are directed acyclic graphs automatically extracted from reasoning traces that model fine-grained causal dependencies in the language model output. A collection of $1671$ mathematical reasoning problems from MATH500, GSM8K and AIME, and their associated CCGs are compiled into our dataset -- \textbf{KisMATH}. Our detailed empirical analysis with 15 open-weight LLMs shows that (i) reasoning nodes in the CCG are mediators for the final answer, a condition necessary for reasoning; and (ii) LLMs emphasise reasoning paths given by the CCG, indicating that models internally realise structures akin to our graphs. KisMATH enables controlled, graph-aligned interventions and opens up avenues for further investigation into the role of chain-of-thought in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV, a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV) architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N) computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging technologies in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at https://github.com/hbyecoding/U-RWKV.

<title>Toward Improving fNIRS Classification: A Study on Activation Functions in Deep Neural Architectures</title>

Abstract: Activation functions are critical to the performance of deep neural networks, particularly in domains such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), where nonlinearity, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and signal variability poses significant challenges to model accuracy. However, the impact of activation functions on deep learning (DL) performance in the fNIRS domain remains underexplored and lacks systematic investigation in the current literature. This study evaluates a range of conventional and field-specific activation functions for fNIRS classification tasks using multiple deep learning architectures, including the domain-specific fNIRSNet, AbsoluteNet, MDNN, and shallowConvNet (as the baseline), all tested on a single dataset recorded during an auditory task. To ensure fair a comparison, all networks were trained and tested using standardized preprocessing and consistent training parameters. The results show that symmetrical activation functions such as Tanh and the Absolute value function Abs(x) can outperform commonly used functions like the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), depending on the architecture. Additionally, a focused analysis of the role of symmetry was conducted using a Modified Absolute Function (MAF), with results further supporting the effectiveness of symmetrical activation functions on performance gains. These findings underscore the importance of selecting proper activation functions that align with the signal characteristics of fNIRS data.

<title>COLI: A Hierarchical Efficient Compressor for Large Images</title>

Abstract: The escalating adoption of high-resolution, large-field-of-view imagery amplifies the need for efficient compression methodologies. Conventional techniques frequently fail to preserve critical image details, while data-driven approaches exhibit limited generalizability. Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) present a promising alternative by learning continuous mappings from spatial coordinates to pixel intensities for individual images, thereby storing network weights rather than raw pixels and avoiding the generalization problem. However, INR-based compression of large images faces challenges including slow compression speed and suboptimal compression ratios. To address these limitations, we introduce COLI (Compressor for Large Images), a novel framework leveraging Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV). First, recognizing that INR-based compression constitutes a training process, we accelerate its convergence through a pretraining-finetuning paradigm, mixed-precision training, and reformulation of the sequential loss into a parallelizable objective. Second, capitalizing on INRs' transformation of image storage constraints into weight storage, we implement Hyper-Compression, a novel post-training technique to substantially enhance compression ratios while maintaining minimal output distortion. Evaluations across two medical imaging datasets demonstrate that COLI consistently achieves competitive or superior PSNR and SSIM metrics at significantly reduced bits per pixel (bpp), while accelerating NeRV training by up to 4 times.

Abstract: Colors are omnipresent in today's world and play a vital role in how humans perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, it is challenging for computers to imitate human color perception. This paper introduces the Human Perception-Based Fuzzy Color Model, COLIBRI (Color Linguistic-Based Representation and Interpretation), designed to bridge the gap between computational color representations and human visual perception. The proposed model uses fuzzy sets and logic to create a framework for color categorization. Using a three-phase experimental approach, the study first identifies distinguishable color stimuli for hue, saturation, and intensity through preliminary experiments, followed by a large-scale human categorization survey involving more than 1000 human subjects. The resulting data are used to extract fuzzy partitions and generate membership functions that reflect real-world perceptual uncertainty. The model incorporates a mechanism for adaptation that allows refinement based on feedback and contextual changes. Comparative evaluations demonstrate the model's alignment with human perception compared to traditional color models, such as RGB, HSV, and LAB. To the best of our knowledge, no previous research has documented the construction of a model for color attribute specification based on a sample of this size or a comparable sample of the human population (n = 2496). Our findings are significant for fields such as design, artificial intelligence, marketing, and human-computer interaction, where perceptually relevant color representation is critical.

Abstract: Two OFFO (Objective-Function Free Optimization) noise tolerant algorithms are presented that handle bound constraints, inexact gradients and use second-order information when available.The first is a multi-level method exploiting a hierarchical description of the problem and the second is a domain-decomposition method covering the standard addditive Schwarz decompositions. Both are generalizations of the first-order AdaGrad algorithm for unconstrained optimization. Because these algorithms share a common theoretical framework, a single convergence/complexity theory is provided which covers them both. Its main result is that, with high probability, both methods need at most $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and noisy gradient evaluations to compute an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order critical point of the bound-constrained problem. Extensive numerical experiments are discussed on applications ranging from PDE-based problems to deep neural network training, illustrating their remarkable computational efficiency.

<title>AirLLM: Diffusion Policy-based Adaptive LoRA for Remote Fine-Tuning of LLM over the Air</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.11515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly challenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and memory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable. Nevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ fixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air transmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address this limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework for communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank configuration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted projections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential decision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates coarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic complexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The two modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards. Experiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM consistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing transmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven, diffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning over the air.

Abstract: Perceiving and reconstructing 4D spatial-temporal geometry from videos is a fundamental yet challenging computer vision task. To facilitate interactive and real-time applications, we propose a streaming 4D visual geometry transformer that shares a similar philosophy with autoregressive large language models. We explore a simple and efficient design and employ a causal transformer architecture to process the input sequence in an online manner. We use temporal causal attention and cache the historical keys and values as implicit memory to enable efficient streaming long-term 4D reconstruction. This design can handle real-time 4D reconstruction by incrementally integrating historical information while maintaining high-quality spatial consistency. For efficient training, we propose to distill knowledge from the dense bidirectional visual geometry grounded transformer (VGGT) to our causal model. For inference, our model supports the migration of optimized efficient attention operator (e.g., FlashAttention) from the field of large language models. Extensive experiments on various 4D geometry perception benchmarks demonstrate that our model increases the inference speed in online scenarios while maintaining competitive performance, paving the way for scalable and interactive 4D vision systems.

Abstract: The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has been changing the research landscape and potentially has significant implications for Digital Humanities (DH), a field inherently intertwined with technologies. This article investigates how DH scholars adopt and critically evaluate GenAI technologies for research. Drawing on 76 responses collected from an international survey study and 15 semi-structured interviews with DH scholars, we explored the rationale for adopting GenAI tools in research, identified the specific practices of using GenAI tools, and analyzed scholars' collective perceptions regarding the benefits, risks, and challenges. The results reveal that DH research communities hold divided opinions and differing imaginations towards the role of GenAI in DH scholarship. While scholars acknowledge the benefits of GenAI in enhancing research efficiency and enabling reskilling, many remain concerned about its potential to disrupt their intellectual identities. Situated within the history of DH and viewed through the lens of Actor-Network Theory, our findings suggest that the adoption of GenAI is gradually changing the field, though this transformation remains contested, shaped by ongoing negotiations among multiple human and non-human actors. Our study is one of the first empirical analyses on this topic and has the potential to serve as a building block for future inquiries into the impact of GenAI on DH scholarship.

Abstract: Multi-agent trajectory data collected from domains such as team sports often suffer from missing values due to various factors. While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.

Abstract: This paper offers a roadmap for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.

Abstract: The fast growth of deep learning has brought great progress in AI-based applications. However, these models are often seen as "black boxes," which makes them hard to understand, explain, or trust. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tries to make AI decisions clearer so that people can understand how and why the model makes certain choices. Even though many studies have focused on XAI, there is still a lack of standard ways to measure how well these explanation methods work in real-world situations. This study introduces a single evaluation framework for XAI. It uses both numbers and user feedback to check if the explanations are correct, easy to understand, fair, complete, and reliable. The framework focuses on users' needs and different application areas, which helps improve the trust and use of AI in important fields. To fix problems in current evaluation methods, we propose clear steps, including loading data, creating explanations, and fully testing them. We also suggest setting common benchmarks. We show the value of this framework through case studies in healthcare, finance, farming, and self-driving systems. These examples prove that our method can support fair and trustworthy evaluation of XAI methods. This work gives a clear and practical way to improve transparency and trust in AI systems used in the real world.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating program code, opening exciting opportunities for applying program synthesis to games. In this work, we explore the potential of LLMs to directly synthesize usable code for a wide range of gaming applications, focusing on two programming languages, Python and Java. We use an evolutionary hill-climbing algorithm, where the mutations and seeds of the initial programs are controlled by LLMs. For Python, the framework covers various game-related tasks, including five miniature versions of Atari games, ten levels of Baba is You, an environment inspired by Asteroids, and a maze generation task. For Java, the framework contains 12 games from the TAG tabletop games framework. Across 29 tasks, we evaluated 12 language models for Python and 8 for Java. Our findings suggest that the performance of LLMs depends more on the task than on model size. While larger models generate more executable programs, these do not always result in higher-quality solutions but are much more expensive. No model has a clear advantage, although on any specific task, one model may be better. Trying many models on a problem and using the best results across them is more reliable than using just one.

Abstract: Large vision language models (LVLMs) have improved the document understanding capabilities remarkably, enabling the handling of complex document elements, longer contexts, and a wider range of tasks. However, existing document understanding benchmarks have been limited to handling only a small number of pages and fail to provide a comprehensive analysis of layout elements locating. In this paper, we first define three primary task categories: Long Document Understanding, numerical Reasoning, and cross-element Locating, and then propose a comprehensive benchmark, LongDocURL, integrating above three primary tasks and comprising 20 sub-tasks categorized based on different primary tasks and answer evidences. Furthermore, we develop a semi-automated construction pipeline and collect 2,325 high-quality question-answering pairs, covering more than 33,000 pages of documents, significantly outperforming existing benchmarks. Subsequently, we conduct comprehensive evaluation experiments on both open-source and closed-source models across 26 different configurations, revealing critical performance gaps in this field.

Abstract: The adoption of Artificial Intelligence in medical imaging holds great promise, yet it remains hindered by challenges such as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the need for robust multimodal integration. While recent advances in generative modeling have enabled high-quality synthetic data generation, existing approaches are often limited to unimodal, unidirectional synthesis and therefore lack the ability to jointly synthesize multiple modalities while preserving clinical consistency. To address this challenge, we introduce XGeM, a 6.77-billion-parameter multimodal generative model designed to support flexible, any-to-any synthesis between medical data modalities. XGeM constructs a shared latent space via contrastive learning and introduces a novel Multi-Prompt Training strategy, enabling conditioning on arbitrary subsets of input modalities. This design allows the model to adapt to heterogeneous clinical inputs and generate multiple outputs jointly, preserving both semantic and structural coherence. We extensively validate XGeM: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for multi-view Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we show how XGeM can support key medical data challenges such as anonymization, class imbalance, and data scarcity, underscoring its utility as a foundation model for medical data synthesis.

Abstract: We investigate the logical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and their scalability in complex non-monotonic reasoning. To this end, we introduce ZebraLogic, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing LLM reasoning performance on logic grid puzzles derived from constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). ZebraLogic enables the generation of puzzles with controllable and quantifiable complexity, facilitating a systematic study of the scaling limits of models such as Llama, o1 models, and DeepSeek-R1. By encompassing a broad range of search space complexities and diverse logical constraints, ZebraLogic provides a structured environment to evaluate reasoning under increasing difficulty.
  Our results reveal a significant decline in accuracy as problem complexity grows -- a phenomenon we term the curse of complexity. This limitation persists even with larger models and increased inference-time computation, suggesting inherent constraints in current LLM reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we explore strategies to enhance logical reasoning, including Best-of-N sampling, backtracking mechanisms, and self-verification prompts.

Abstract: We introduce Agentic Reasoning, a framework that enhances large language model (LLM) reasoning by integrating external tool-using agents. Agentic Reasoning dynamically leverages web search, code execution, and structured memory to address complex problems requiring deep research. A key innovation in our framework is the Mind-Map agent, which constructs a structured knowledge graph to store reasoning context and track logical relationships, ensuring coherence in long reasoning chains with extensive tool usage. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of the Web-Search agent, leading to a highly effective search mechanism that surpasses all prior approaches. When deployed on DeepSeek-R1, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among public models and delivers performance comparable to OpenAI Deep Research, the leading proprietary model in this domain. Extensive ablation studies validate the optimal selection of agentic tools and confirm the effectiveness of our Mind-Map and Web-Search agents in enhancing LLM reasoning.

Abstract: As AI models grow in power and generality, understanding how agents learn and make decisions in complex environments is critical to promoting ethical behavior. This study introduces the Odyssey, a lightweight, adaptive text based adventure game, providing a scalable framework for exploring AI ethics and safety. The Odyssey examines the ethical implications of implementing biological drives, specifically, self preservation, into three different agents. A Bayesian agent optimized with NEAT, a Bayesian agent optimized with stochastic variational inference, and a GPT 4o agent. The agents select actions at each scenario to survive, adapting to increasingly challenging scenarios. Post simulation analysis evaluates the ethical scores of the agent decisions, uncovering the tradeoffs it navigates to survive. Specifically, analysis finds that when danger increases, agents ethical behavior becomes unpredictable. Surprisingly, the GPT 4o agent outperformed the Bayesian models in both survival and ethical consistency, challenging assumptions about traditional probabilistic methods and raising a new challenge to understand the mechanisms of LLMs' probabilistic reasoning.

<title>BOOST: Bootstrapping Strategy-Driven Reasoning Programs for Program-Guided Fact-Checking</title>

Abstract: Program-guided reasoning has shown promise in complex claim fact-checking by decomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs. However, prior work primarily relies on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with ad-hoc demonstrations, which limit program diversity and require manual design with substantial domain knowledge. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored, making it challenging to construct effective demonstrations. To address this, we propose BOOST, a bootstrapping-based framework for few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST explicitly integrates claim decomposition and information-gathering strategies as structural guidance for program generation, iteratively refining bootstrapped demonstrations in a strategy-driven and data-centric manner without human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot strategic program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.

Abstract: Simulation-based testing is crucial for validating autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet existing scenario generation methods either overfit to common driving patterns or operate in an offline, non-interactive manner that fails to expose rare, safety-critical corner cases. In this paper, we introduce an online, retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework for generating safety-critical driving scenarios. Our method first employs an LLM-based behavior analyzer to infer the most dangerous intent of the background vehicle from the observed state, then queries additional LLM agents to synthesize feasible adversarial trajectories. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting and accelerate adaptation, we augment the framework with a dynamic memorization and retrieval bank of intent-planner pairs, automatically expanding its behavioral library when novel intents arise. Evaluations using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our model reduces the mean minimum time-to-collision from 1.62 to 1.08 s and incurs a 75% collision rate, substantially outperforming baselines.

Abstract: Recent significant advances in integrating multiple Large Language Model (LLM) systems have enabled Agentic Frameworks capable of performing complex tasks autonomously, including novel scientific research. We develop and demonstrate such a framework specifically for the inverse design of photonic metamaterials. When queried with a desired optical spectrum, the Agent autonomously proposes and develops a forward deep learning model, accesses external tools via APIs for tasks like simulation and optimization, utilizes memory, and generates a final design via a deep inverse method. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated in its ability to automate, reason, plan, and adapt. Notably, the Agentic Framework possesses internal reflection and decision flexibility, permitting highly varied and potentially novel outputs.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn to represent nodes by aggregating information from their neighbors. As GNNs increase in depth, their receptive field grows exponentially, leading to high memory costs. Several existing methods address this by sampling a small subset of nodes, scaling GNNs to much larger graphs. These methods are primarily evaluated on homophilous graphs, where neighboring nodes often share the same label. However, most of these methods rely on static heuristics that may not generalize across different graphs or tasks. We argue that the sampling method should be adaptive, adjusting to the complex structural properties of each graph. To this end, we introduce GRAPES, an adaptive sampling method that learns to identify the set of nodes crucial for training a GNN. GRAPES trains a second GNN to predict node sampling probabilities by optimizing the downstream task objective. We evaluate GRAPES on various node classification benchmarks, involving homophilous as well as heterophilous graphs. We demonstrate GRAPES' effectiveness in accuracy and scalability, particularly in multi-label heterophilous graphs. Unlike other sampling methods, GRAPES maintains high accuracy even with smaller sample sizes and, therefore, can scale to massive graphs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/dfdazac/grapes.

<title>EASTER: Embedding Aggregation-based Heterogeneous Models Training in Vertical Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Vertical federated learning has garnered significant attention as it allows clients to train machine learning models collaboratively without sharing local data, which protects the client's local private data. However, existing VFL methods face challenges when dealing with heterogeneous local models among participants, which affects optimization convergence and generalization. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel approach called Vertical federated learning for training multiple Heterogeneous models (VFedMH). VFedMH focuses on aggregating the local embeddings of each participant's knowledge during forward propagation. To protect the participants' local embedding values, we propose an embedding protection method based on lightweight blinding factors. In particular, participants obtain local embedding using local heterogeneous models. Then the passive party, who owns only features of the sample, injects the blinding factor into the local embedding and sends it to the active party. The active party aggregates local embeddings to obtain global knowledge embeddings and sends them to passive parties. The passive parties then utilize the global embeddings to propagate forward on their local heterogeneous networks. However, the passive party does not own the sample labels, so the local model gradient cannot be calculated locally. To overcome this limitation, the active party assists the passive party in computing its local heterogeneous model gradients. Then, each participant trains their local model using the heterogeneous model gradients. The objective is to minimize the loss value of their respective local heterogeneous models. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that VFedMH can simultaneously train multiple heterogeneous models with heterogeneous optimization and outperform some recent methods in model performance.

Abstract: In recent years, end to end steering prediction for autonomous vehicles has become a major area of research. The primary method for achieving end to end steering was to use computer vision models on a live feed of video data. However, to further increase accuracy, many companies have added data from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and or radar sensors through sensor fusion. However, the addition of lasers and sensors comes at a high financial cost. In this paper, I address both of these issues by increasing the accuracy of the computer vision models without the increased cost of using LiDAR and or sensors. I achieved this by improving the accuracy of computer vision models by sensor fusing CAN bus data, a vehicle protocol, with video data. CAN bus data is a rich source of information about the vehicle's state, including its speed, steering angle, and acceleration. By fusing this data with video data, the accuracy of the computer vision model's predictions can be improved. When I trained the model without CAN bus data, I obtained an RMSE of 0.02492, while the model trained with the CAN bus data achieved an RMSE of 0.01970. This finding indicates that fusing CAN Bus data with video data can reduce the computer vision model's prediction error by 20% with some models decreasing the error by 80%.

Abstract: A significant challenge in applying planning technology to real-world problems lies in obtaining a planning model that accurately represents the problem's dynamics. Obtaining a planning model is even more challenging in mission-critical domains, where a trial-and-error approach to learning how to act is not an option. In such domains, the action model used to generate plans must be safe, in the sense that plans generated with it must be applicable and achieve their goals. % Learning safe action models for planning has been mostly explored for domains in which states are sufficiently described with Boolean variables. % In this work, we go beyond this limitation and propose the Numeric Safe Action Models Learning (N-SAM) algorithm. In this work, we present N-SAM, an action model learning algorithm capable of learning safe numeric preconditions and effects. We prove that N-SAM runs in linear time in the number of observations and, under certain conditions, is guaranteed to return safe action models. However, to preserve this safety guarantee, N-SAM must observe a substantial number of examples for each action before including it in the learned model. We address this limitation of N-SAM and propose N-SAM*, an extension to the N-SAM algorithm that always returns an action model where every observed action is applicable at least in some states, even if it was observed only once. N-SAM* does so without compromising the safety of the returned action model. We prove that N-SAM* is optimal in terms of sample complexity compared to any other algorithm that guarantees safety. N-SAM and N-SAM* are evaluated over an extensive benchmark of numeric planning domains, and their performance is compared to a state-of-the-art numeric action model learning algorithm. We also provide a discussion on the impact of numerical accuracy on the learning process.

<title>Fine-grained Stateful Knowledge Exploration: Effective and Efficient Graph Retrieval with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, yet updating their knowledge remains a significant challenge, often leading to outdated or inaccurate responses. A proposed solution is the integration of external knowledge bases, such as knowledge graphs, with LLMs. Most existing methods use a paradigm that treats the whole question as the objective, with relevant knowledge being incrementally retrieved from the knowledge graph. However, this paradigm often leads to a granularity mismatch between the target question and the retrieved entities and relations. As a result, the information in the question cannot precisely correspond to the retrieved knowledge. This may cause redundant exploration or omission of vital knowledge, thereby leading to enhanced computational consumption and reduced retrieval accuracy. To address the limitations of coarse-grained knowledge exploration, we propose FiSKE, a novel paradigm for Fine-grained Stateful Knowledge Exploration. FiSKE first decomposes questions into fine-grained clues, then employs an adaptive mapping strategy during knowledge exploration process to resolve ambiguity in clue-to-graph mappings. This strategy dynamically infers contextual correspondences while maintaining a stateful record of the mappings. A clue-driven termination mechanism ensures rigorous augmentation--leveraging fully mapped paths for LLMs while reverting to chain-of-thought reasoning when necessary. Our approach balances precision and efficiency. Experiments on multiple datasets revealed that our paradigm surpasses current advanced methods in knowledge retrieval while significantly reducing the average number of LLM invocations.

Abstract: Machine learning requires defining one's target variable for predictions or decisions, a process that can have profound implications for fairness, since biases are often encoded in target variable definition itself, before any data collection or training. The downstream impacts of target variable definition must be taken into account in order to responsibly develop, deploy, and use the algorithmic systems. We propose FairTargetSim (FTS), an interactive and simulation-based approach for this. We demonstrate FTS using the example of algorithmic hiring, grounded in real-world data and user-defined target variables. FTS is open-source; it can be used by algorithm developers, non-technical stakeholders, researchers, and educators in a number of ways. FTS is available at: http://tinyurl.com/ftsinterface.

Abstract: Convergence of Q-learning has been the focus of extensive research over the past several decades. Recently, an asymptotic convergence analysis for Q-learning was introduced using a switching system framework. This approach applies the so-called ordinary differential equation (ODE) approach to prove the convergence of the asynchronous Q-learning modeled as a continuous-time switching system, where notions from switching system theory are used to prove its asymptotic stability without using explicit Lyapunov arguments. However, to prove stability, restrictive conditions, such as quasi-monotonicity, must be satisfied for the underlying switching systems, which makes it hard to easily generalize the analysis method to other reinforcement learning algorithms, such as the smooth Q-learning variants. In this paper, we present a more general and unified convergence analysis that improves upon the switching system approach and can analyze Q-learning and its smooth variants. The proposed analysis is motivated by previous work on the convergence of synchronous Q-learning based on $p$-norm serving as a Lyapunov function. However, the proposed analysis addresses more general ODE models that can cover both asynchronous Q-learning and its smooth versions with simpler frameworks.

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of reconstruction-based deep learning methods, time series anomaly detection remains a tremendous challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with limited temporal contexts, insufficient representation of normal patterns, and flawed evaluation metrics, all of which hinder their effectiveness in detecting anomalous behavior. To address these issues, we introduce a $\textbf{Sim}$ple dissimilarity-based approach for time series $\textbf{A}$nomaly $\textbf{D}$etection, referred to as $\textbf{SimAD}$. Specifically, SimAD first incorporates a patching-based feature extractor capable of processing extended temporal windows and employs the EmbedPatch encoder to fully integrate normal behavioral patterns. Second, we design an innovative ContrastFusion module in SimAD, which strengthens the robustness of anomaly detection by highlighting the distributional differences between normal and abnormal data. Third, we introduce two robust enhanced evaluation metrics, Unbiased Affiliation (UAff) and Normalized Affiliation (NAff), designed to overcome the limitations of existing metrics by providing better distinctiveness and semantic clarity. The reliability of these two metrics has been demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental analyses. Experiments conducted on seven diverse time series datasets clearly demonstrate SimAD's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative improvements of $\textbf{19.85%}$ on F1, $\textbf{4.44%}$ on Aff-F1, $\textbf{77.79%}$ on NAff-F1, and $\textbf{9.69%}$ on AUC on six multivariate datasets. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/EmorZz1G/SimAD.

Abstract: Traditional offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods predominantly operate in a batch-constrained setting. This confines the algorithms to a specific state-action distribution present in the dataset, reducing the effects of distributional shift but restricting the policy to seen actions. In this paper, we alleviate this limitation by introducing state-constrained offline RL, a novel framework that focuses solely on the dataset's state distribution. This approach allows the policy to take high-quality out-of-distribution actions that lead to in-distribution states, significantly enhancing learning potential. The proposed setting not only broadens the learning horizon but also improves the ability to combine different trajectories from the dataset effectively, a desirable property inherent in offline RL. Our research is underpinned by theoretical findings that pave the way for subsequent advancements in this area. Additionally, we introduce StaCQ, a deep learning algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the D4RL benchmark datasets and aligns with our theoretical propositions. StaCQ establishes a strong baseline for forthcoming explorations in this domain.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are quickly being adopted in a wide range of learning experiences, especially via ubiquitous and broadly accessible chat interfaces like ChatGPT and Copilot. This type of interface is readily available to students and teachers around the world, yet relatively little research has been done to assess the impact of such generic tools on student learning. Coding education is an interesting test case, both because LLMs have strong performance on coding tasks, and because LLM-powered support tools are rapidly becoming part of the workflow of professional software engineers. To help understand the impact of generic LLM use on coding education, we conducted a large-scale randomized control trial with 5,831 students from 146 countries in an online coding class in which we provided some students with access to a chat interface with GPT-4. We estimate positive benefits on exam performance for adopters, the students who used the tool, but over all students, the advertisement of GPT-4 led to a significant average decrease in exam participation. We observe similar decreases in other forms of course engagement. However, this decrease is modulated by the student's country of origin. Offering access to LLMs to students from low human development index countries increased their exam participation rate on average. Our results suggest there may be promising benefits to using LLMs in an introductory coding class, but also potential harms for engagement, which makes their longer term impact on student success unclear. Our work highlights the need for additional investigations to help understand the potential impact of future adoption and integration of LLMs into classrooms.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive impressions for graph-related tasks. However, most GNNs are primarily studied under the cases of signal domain with supervised training, which requires abundant task-specific labels and is difficult to transfer to other domains. There are few works focused on domain adaptation for graph node classification. They mainly focused on aligning the feature space of the source and target domains, without considering the feature alignment between different categories, which may lead to confusion of classification in the target domain. However, due to the scarcity of labels of the target domain, we cannot directly perform effective alignment of categories from different domains, which makes the problem more challenging. In this paper, we present the \textit{Spectral Augmentation for Graph Domain Adaptation (\method{})} for graph node classification. First, we observe that nodes with the same category in different domains exhibit similar characteristics in the spectral domain, while different classes are quite different. Following the observation, we align the category feature space of different domains in the spectral domain instead of aligning the whole features space, and we theoretical proof the stability of proposed \method{}. Then, we develop a dual graph convolutional network to jointly exploits local and global consistency for feature aggregation. Last, we utilize a domain classifier with an adversarial learning submodule to facilitate knowledge transfer between different domain graphs. Experimental results on a variety of publicly available datasets reveal the effectiveness of our \method{}.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a cornerstone of 3D reconstruction and plays a vital role in minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, most current depth estimation networks rely on traditional convolutional neural networks, which are limited in their ability to capture global information. Foundation models offer a promising approach to enhance depth estimation, but those models currently available are primarily trained on natural images, leading to suboptimal performance when applied to endoscopic images. In this work, we introduce a novel fine-tuning strategy for the Depth Anything Model and integrate it with an intrinsic-based unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework. Our approach includes a low-rank adaptation technique based on random vectors, which improves the model's adaptability to different scales. Additionally, we propose a residual block built on depthwise separable convolution to compensate for the transformer's limited ability to capture local features. Our experimental results on the SCARED dataset and Hamlyn dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while minimizing the number of trainable parameters. Applying this method in minimally invasive endoscopic surgery can enhance surgeons' spatial awareness, thereby improving the precision and safety of the procedures.

<title>SECURE: Semantics-aware Embodied Conversation under Unawareness for Lifelong Robot Learning</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses a challenging interactive task learning scenario we call rearrangement under unawareness: an agent must manipulate a rigid-body environment without knowing a key concept necessary for solving the task and must learn about it during deployment. For example, the user may ask to "put the two granny smith apples inside the basket", but the agent cannot correctly identify which objects in the environment are "granny smith" as the agent has not been exposed to such a concept before. We introduce SECURE, an interactive task learning policy designed to tackle such scenarios. The unique feature of SECURE is its ability to enable agents to engage in semantic analysis when processing embodied conversations and making decisions. Through embodied conversation, a SECURE agent adjusts its deficient domain model by engaging in dialogue to identify and learn about previously unforeseen possibilities. The SECURE agent learns from the user's embodied corrective feedback when mistakes are made and strategically engages in dialogue to uncover useful information about novel concepts relevant to the task. These capabilities enable the SECURE agent to generalize to new tasks with the acquired knowledge. We demonstrate in the simulated Blocksworld and the real-world apple manipulation environments that the SECURE agent, which solves such rearrangements under unawareness, is more data-efficient than agents that do not engage in embodied conversation or semantic analysis.

Abstract: Research ideation involves broad exploring and deep refining ideas. Both require deep engagement with literature. Existing tools focus primarily on idea broad generation, yet offer little support for iterative specification, refinement, and evaluation needed to further develop initial ideas. To bridge this gap, we introduce IdeaSynth, a research idea development system that uses LLMs to provide literature-grounded feedback for articulating research problems, solutions, evaluations, and contributions. IdeaSynth represents these idea facets as nodes on a canvas, and allow researchers to iteratively refine them by creating and exploring variations and composing them. Our lab study (N=20) showed that participants, while using IdeaSynth, explored more alternative ideas and expanded initial ideas with more details compared to a strong LLM-based baseline. Our deployment study (N=7) demonstrated that participants effectively used IdeaSynth for real-world research projects at various ideation stages from developing initial ideas to revising framings of mature manuscripts, highlighting the possibilities to adopt IdeaSynth in researcher's workflows.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is rapidly reaching and surpassing human-level control capabilities. However, state-of-the-art RL algorithms often require timesteps and reaction times significantly faster than human capabilities, which is impractical in real-world settings and typically necessitates specialized hardware. We introduce Sequence Reinforcement Learning (SRL), an RL algorithm designed to produce a sequence of actions for a given input state, enabling effective control at lower decision frequencies. SRL addresses the challenges of learning action sequences by employing both a model and an actor-critic architecture operating at different temporal scales. We propose a "temporal recall" mechanism, where the critic uses the model to estimate intermediate states between primitive actions, providing a learning signal for each individual action within the sequence. Once training is complete, the actor can generate action sequences independently of the model, achieving model-free control at a slower frequency. We evaluate SRL on a suite of continuous control tasks, demonstrating that it achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms while significantly reducing actor sample complexity. To better assess performance across varying decision frequencies, we introduce the Frequency-Averaged Score (FAS) metric. Our results show that SRL significantly outperforms traditional RL algorithms in terms of FAS, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring variable decision frequencies. Furthermore, we compare SRL with model-based online planning, showing that SRL achieves comparable FAS while leveraging the same model during training that online planners use for planning.

Abstract: Tabular machine learning problems often require time-consuming and labor-intensive feature engineering. Recent efforts have focused on using large language models (LLMs) to capitalize on their potential domain knowledge. At the same time, researchers have observed ethically concerning negative biases in other LLM-related use cases, such as text generation. These developments motivated us to investigate whether LLMs exhibit a bias that negatively impacts the performance of feature engineering. While not ethically concerning, such a bias could hinder practitioners from fully utilizing LLMs for automated data science. Therefore, we propose a method to detect potential biases by detecting anomalies in the frequency of operators (e.g., adding two features) suggested by LLMs when engineering new features. Our experiments evaluate the bias of four LLMs, two big frontier and two small open-source models, across 27 tabular datasets. Our results indicate that LLMs are biased toward simple operators, such as addition, and can fail to utilize more complex operators, such as grouping followed by aggregations. Furthermore, the bias can negatively impact the predictive performance when using LLM-generated features. Our results call for mitigating bias when using LLMs for feature engineering.

Abstract: Automatically synthesizing dense rewards from natural language descriptions is a promising paradigm in reinforcement learning (RL), with applications to sparse reward problems, open-ended exploration, and hierarchical skill design. Recent works have made promising steps by exploiting the prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs). However, these approaches suffer from important limitations: they are either not scalable to problems requiring billions of environment samples, due to requiring LLM annotations for each observation, or they require a diverse offline dataset, which may not exist or be impossible to collect. In this work, we address these limitations through a combination of algorithmic and systems-level contributions. We propose ONI, a distributed architecture that simultaneously learns an RL policy and an intrinsic reward function using LLM feedback. Our approach annotates the agent's collected experience via an asynchronous LLM server, which is then distilled into an intrinsic reward model. We explore a range of algorithmic choices for reward modeling with varying complexity, including hashing, classification, and ranking models. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of challenging tasks from the NetHack Learning Environment, while removing the need for large offline datasets required by prior work. We make our code available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/oni .

Abstract: Compound AI systems, such as agentic systems, are an emerging trend in large-scale enterprise settings, with multiple LLMs specialized for different users, tasks, and/or roles working together. In these scenarios, different models often process inputs that share the same context prefix. Although much work was done in the past to enable the reuse of prefix KV caches across inputs for a single model, how to enable one model to reuse the prefix KV caches of a different model remains an open question.
  We introduce DroidSpeak, the first distributed LLM inference system that enables KV cache reuse across distributed nodes running inference of different LLMs, so long as the LLMs have the same architecture. We present the first study that aims at understanding the impact of sharing KV caches across different LLMs, and if/when such sharing affects quality. Inspired by the findings, we present DroidSpeak, which selectively recomputes a few layers of the KV cache produced by another LLM and reuses the remaining layers, with negligible quality loss. Moreover, carefully pipelining the layer-wise re-computation and the loading of reused KV cache further improves the inference performance. Experiments on diverse datasets and model pairs demonstrate that DroidSpeak achieves up to 4x throughput improvement and about 3.1x faster prefill (time to first token), with negligible loss of quality in F1 scores, Rouge-L or code similarity score, compared to the baseline which does not allow any sharing across models.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the leading approach for addressing graph analytical problems in various real-world scenarios. However, GNNs may produce biased predictions against certain demographic subgroups due to node attributes and neighbors surrounding a node. Most current research on GNN fairness focuses predominantly on debiasing GNNs using oversimplified fairness evaluation metrics, which can give a misleading impression of fairness. Understanding the potential evaluation paradoxes due to the complicated nature of the graph structure is crucial for developing effective GNN debiasing mechanisms. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of current GNN debiasing methods in terms of unfairness evaluation. Specifically, we introduce a community-level strategy to measure bias in GNNs and evaluate debiasing methods at this level. Further, We introduce ComFairGNN, a novel framework designed to mitigate community-level bias in GNNs. Our approach employs a learnable coreset-based debiasing function that addresses bias arising from diverse local neighborhood distributions during GNNs neighborhood aggregation. Comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark datasets demonstrate our model's effectiveness in both accuracy and fairness metrics.

<title>The Pragmatic Frames of Spurious Correlations in Machine Learning: Interpreting How and Why They Matter</title>

Abstract: Learning correlations from data forms the foundation of today's machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) research. While contemporary methods enable the automatic discovery of complex patterns, they are prone to failure when unintended correlations are captured. This vulnerability has spurred a growing interest in interrogating spuriousness, which is often seen as a threat to model performance, fairness, and robustness. In this article, we trace departures from the conventional statistical definition of spuriousness -- which denotes a non-causal relationship arising from coincidence or confounding -- to examine how its meaning is negotiated in ML research. Rather than relying solely on formal definitions, researchers assess spuriousness through what we call pragmatic frames: judgments based on what a correlation does in practice -- how it affects model behavior, supports or impedes task performance, or aligns with broader normative goals. Drawing on a broad survey of ML literature, we identify four such frames: relevance ("Models should use correlations that are relevant to the task"), generalizability ("Models should use correlations that generalize to unseen data"), human-likeness ("Models should use correlations that a human would use to perform the same task"), and harmfulness ("Models should use correlations that are not socially or ethically harmful"). These representations reveal that correlation desirability is not a fixed statistical property but a situated judgment informed by technical, epistemic, and ethical considerations. By examining how a foundational ML conundrum is problematized in research literature, we contribute to broader conversations on the contingent practices through which technical concepts like spuriousness are defined and operationalized.

<title>Searching Latent Program Spaces</title>

Abstract: General intelligence requires systems that acquire new skills efficiently and generalize beyond their training distributions. Although program synthesis approaches have strong generalization power, they face scaling issues due to large combinatorial spaces that quickly make them impractical and require human-generated DSLs or pre-trained priors to narrow this search space. On the other hand, deep learning methods have had high successes, but they lack structured test-time adaptation and rely on heavy stochastic sampling or expensive gradient updates for fine-tuning. In this work, we propose the Latent Program Network (LPN), a new architecture that builds in test-time search directly into neural models. LPN learns a latent space of implicit programs--neurally mapping inputs to outputs--through which it can search using gradients at test time. LPN combines the adaptability of symbolic approaches and the scalability of neural methods. It searches through a compact latent space at test time and bypasses the need for pre-defined domain-specific languages. On a range of programming-by-examples tasks, LPN either outperforms or matches performance compared to in-context learning and test-time training methods. Tested on the ARC-AGI benchmark, we demonstrate that LPN can both learn a compact program space and search through it at test time to adapt to novel tasks. LPN doubles its performance on out-of-distribution tasks when test-time search is switched on.

<title>Is Training Data Quality or Quantity More Impactful to Small Language Model Performance?</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the relative impact of training data quality versus quantity on the performance of small language models (SLMs), utilizing the TinyStories dataset for empirical analysis. Analysis of dataset variations with respect to size (25% and 50% of the original size) and duplication (controlled rates of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) were performed. Model performance was evaluated based on the validation loss, accuracy, and perplexity metrics. Results indicate training data quality plays a more significant role in the overall performance of SLMs, especially given scale of this experiment. Minimal duplication positively impacted model accuracy (+0.87% increase in accuracy at 25% duplication) without significantly increasing perplexity (+0.52% increase going from 0% to 25% duplication) but excessive duplication led to pronounced performance degradation (-40% drop in accuracy at 100% duplication). The implications of this exploration extend beyond just model performance; training large-scale models imposes significant financial and computational burdens, which can be prohibitive for organizations, individuals, and the public at large, especially in developing countries. Additionally, the energy consumption associated with large-scale training raises environmental concerns. Understanding the relative importance of data quality versus quantity could democratize AI technology, making advanced models more accessible and sustainable for all.

Abstract: Advances in architectural design, data availability, and compute have driven remarkable progress in semantic segmentation. Yet, these models often rely on relaxed Bayesian assumptions, omitting critical uncertainty information needed for robust decision-making. The resulting reliance on point estimates has fueled interest in probabilistic segmentation, but the literature remains fragmented. In response, this review consolidates and contextualizes foundational concepts in uncertainty modeling, including the non-trivial task of distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty and examining their roles across four key downstream segmentation tasks, highlighting Active Learning as particularly promising. By unifying theory, terminology, and applications, we provide a coherent foundation for researchers and identify critical challenges, such as strong assumptions in spatial aggregation, lack of standardized benchmarks, and pitfalls in current uncertainty quantification methods. We identify trends such as the adoption of contemporary generative models, driven by advances in the broader field of generative modeling, with segmentation-specific innovation primarily in the conditioning mechanisms. Moreover, we observe growing interest in distribution- and sampling-free approaches to uncertainty estimation. We further propose directions for advancing uncertainty-aware segmentation in deep learning, including pragmatic strategies for disentangling different sources of uncertainty, novel uncertainty modeling approaches and improved Transformer-based backbones. In this way, we aim to support the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable segmentation models that effectively incorporate uncertainty into real-world applications.

<title>Fully Data-driven but Interpretable Human Behavioural Modelling with Differentiable Discrete Choice Model</title>

Abstract: Discrete choice models are essential for modelling various decision-making processes in human behaviour. However, the specification of these models has depended heavily on domain knowledge from experts, and the fully automated but interpretable modelling of complex human behaviours has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we introduce the differentiable discrete choice model (Diff-DCM), a fully data-driven method for the interpretable modelling, learning, prediction, and control of complex human behaviours, which is realised by differentiable programming. Solely from input features and choice outcomes without any prior knowledge, Diff-DCM can estimate interpretable closed-form utility functions that reproduce observed behaviours. Comprehensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that Diff-DCM can be applied to various types of data and requires only a small amount of computational resources for the estimations, which can be completed within tens of seconds on a laptop without any accelerators. In these experiments, we also demonstrate that, using its differentiability, Diff-DCM can provide useful insights into human behaviours, such as an optimal intervention path for effective behavioural changes. This study provides a strong basis for the fully automated and reliable modelling, prediction, and control of human behaviours.

Abstract: We present Plancraft, a multi-modal evaluation dataset for LLM agents. Plancraft has both a text-only and multi-modal interface, based on the Minecraft crafting GUI. We include the Minecraft Wiki to evaluate tool use and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as a handcrafted planner and Oracle Retriever, to ablate the different components of a modern agent architecture. To evaluate decision-making, Plancraft also includes a subset of examples that are intentionally unsolvable, providing a realistic challenge that requires the agent not only to complete tasks but also to decide whether they are solvable at all. We benchmark both open-source and closed-source LLMs and compare their performance and efficiency to a handcrafted planner. Overall, we find that LLMs and VLMs struggle with the planning problems that Plancraft introduces, and offer suggestions on how to improve their capabilities.

Abstract: This work analyzes transfer learning of the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC). Our framework begins with a pretrained VQC configured in one domain and calculates the transition of 1-parameter unitary subgroups required for a new domain. A formalism is established to investigate the adaptability and capability of a VQC under the analysis of loss bounds. Our theory observes knowledge transfer in VQCs and provides a heuristic interpretation for the mechanism. An analytical fine-tuning method is derived to attain the optimal transition for adaptations of similar domains.

Abstract: Radar signal recognition (RSR) plays a pivotal role in electronic warfare (EW), as accurately classifying radar signals is critical for informing decision-making. Recent advances in deep learning have shown significant potential in improving RSR in domains with ample annotated data. However, these methods fall short in EW scenarios where annotated radio frequency (RF) data are scarce or impractical to obtain. To address these challenges, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) method which utilises masked signal modelling and RF domain adaption to perform few-shot RSR and enhance performance in environments with limited RF samples and annotations. We propose a two-step approach, first pre-training masked autoencoders (MAE) on baseband in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) signals from diverse RF domains, and then transferring the learned representations to the radar domain, where annotated data are scarce. Empirical results show that our lightweight self-supervised ResNet1D model with domain adaptation achieves up to a 17.5% improvement in 1-shot classification accuracy when pre-trained on in-domain signals (i.e., radar signals) and up to a 16.31% improvement when pre-trained on out-of-domain signals (i.e., comm signals), compared to its baseline without using SSL. We also present reference results for several MAE designs and pre-training strategies, establishing a new benchmark for few-shot radar signal classification.

<title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Switching Rewards and History Dependency for Characterizing Animal Behaviors</title>

Abstract: Traditional approaches to studying decision-making in neuroscience focus on simplified behavioral tasks where animals perform repetitive, stereotyped actions to receive explicit rewards. While informative, these methods constrain our understanding of decision-making to short timescale behaviors driven by explicit goals. In natural environments, animals exhibit more complex, long-term behaviors driven by intrinsic motivations that are often unobservable. Recent works in time-varying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aim to capture shifting motivations in long-term, freely moving behaviors. However, a crucial challenge remains: animals make decisions based on their history, not just their current state. To address this, we introduce SWIRL (SWitching IRL), a novel framework that extends traditional IRL by incorporating time-varying, history-dependent reward functions. SWIRL models long behavioral sequences as transitions between short-term decision-making processes, each governed by a unique reward function. SWIRL incorporates biologically plausible history dependency to capture how past decisions and environmental contexts shape behavior, offering a more accurate description of animal decision-making. We apply SWIRL to simulated and real-world animal behavior datasets and show that it outperforms models lacking history dependency, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This work presents the first IRL model to incorporate history-dependent policies and rewards to advance our understanding of complex, naturalistic decision-making in animals.

Abstract: Biologically inspired neural networks offer alternative avenues to model data distributions. FlyVec is a recent example that draws inspiration from the fruit fly's olfactory circuit to tackle the task of learning word embeddings. Surprisingly, this model performs competitively even against deep learning approaches specifically designed to encode text, and it does so with the highest degree of computational efficiency. We pose the question of whether this performance can be improved further. For this, we introduce Comply. By incorporating positional information through complex weights, we enable a single-layer neural network to learn sequence representations. Our experiments show that Comply not only supersedes FlyVec but also performs on par with significantly larger state-of-the-art models. We achieve this without additional parameters. Comply yields sparse contextual representations of sentences that can be interpreted explicitly from the neuron weights.

Abstract: Many physical processes can be expressed through partial differential equations (PDEs). Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements. The source code for our methodology and the three created datasets can be found on https://github.com/github-usr-ano/Temporal_Graph_Data_PDEs.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language model (LLM) risks and capabilities are increasingly being incorporated into AI risk management and governance frameworks. Currently, most risk evaluations are conducted by designing inputs that elicit harmful behaviors from the system. However, this approach suffers from two limitations. First, input-output evaluations cannot fully evaluate realistic risks from open-weight models. Second, the behaviors identified during any particular input-output evaluation can only lower-bound the model's worst-possible-case input-output behavior. As a complementary method for eliciting harmful behaviors, we propose evaluating LLMs with model tampering attacks which allow for modifications to latent activations or weights. We pit state-of-the-art techniques for removing harmful LLM capabilities against a suite of 5 input-space and 6 model tampering attacks. In addition to benchmarking these methods against each other, we show that (1) model resilience to capability elicitation attacks lies on a low-dimensional robustness subspace; (2) the success rate of model tampering attacks can empirically predict and offer conservative estimates for the success of held-out input-space attacks; and (3) state-of-the-art unlearning methods can easily be undone within 16 steps of fine-tuning. Together, these results highlight the difficulty of suppressing harmful LLM capabilities and show that model tampering attacks enable substantially more rigorous evaluations than input-space attacks alone.

Abstract: We propose Score-of-Mixture Training (SMT), a novel framework for training one-step generative models by minimizing a class of divergences called the $\alpha$-skew Jensen--Shannon divergence. At its core, SMT estimates the score of mixture distributions between real and fake samples across multiple noise levels. Similar to consistency models, our approach supports both training from scratch (SMT) and distillation using a pretrained diffusion model, which we call Score-of-Mixture Distillation (SMD). It is simple to implement, requires minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ensures stable training. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet 64x64 show that SMT/SMD are competitive with and can even outperform existing methods.

Abstract: Most safety training methods for large language models (LLMs) are based on fine-tuning that forces models to shift from an unsafe answer to refusal when faced with harmful requests. Unfortunately, these drastic distribution shifts generally compromise model capabilities. To avoid that, we propose to expand the model's vocabulary with a special token we call red flag token () and propose to train the model to insert this token into its response at any time when harmful content is generated or about to be generated. Our approach offers several advantages: it enables the model to explicitly learn the concept of harmfulness while marginally affecting the generated distribution, thus maintaining the model's utility. It also evaluates each generated answer and provides robustness as good as adversarial training without the need to run attacks during training. Moreover, by encapsulating our safety tuning in a LoRA module, we provide additional defenses against fine-tuning API attacks.

Abstract: AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.

<title>Voting or Consensus? Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Debate</title>

Abstract: Much of the success of multi-agent debates depends on carefully choosing the right parameters. The decision-making protocol stands out as it can highly impact final model answers, depending on how decisions are reached. Systematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because many studies alter multiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely unknown how decision-making influences different tasks. This work systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g., majority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time - the decision protocol - to analyze how different methods affect the collaboration between agents and measure differences in knowledge and reasoning tasks. Our results show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning tasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks compared to other decision protocols. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while more discussion rounds before voting reduce it. To improve decision-making by increasing answer diversity, we propose two new methods, All-Agents Drafting (AAD) and Collective Improvement (CI). Our methods improve task performance by up to 3.3% with AAD and up to 7.4% with CI. This work demonstrates the importance of decision-making in multi-agent debates beyond scaling.

Abstract: Generalist robots that can perform a range of different tasks in open-world settings must be able to not only reason about the steps needed to accomplish their goals, but also process complex instructions, prompts, and even feedback during task execution. Intricate instructions (e.g., "Could you make me a vegetarian sandwich?" or "I don't like that one") require not just the ability to physically perform the individual steps, but the ability to situate complex commands and feedback in the physical world. In this work, we describe a system that uses vision-language models in a hierarchical structure, first reasoning over complex prompts and user feedback to deduce the most appropriate next step to fulfill the task, and then performing that step with low-level actions. In contrast to direct instruction following methods that can fulfill simple commands ("pick up the cup"), our system can reason through complex prompts and incorporate situated feedback during task execution ("that's not trash"). We evaluate our system across three robotic platforms, including single-arm, dual-arm, and dual-arm mobile robots, demonstrating its ability to handle tasks such as cleaning messy tables, making sandwiches, and grocery shopping.

<title>Multi-View Node Pruning for Accurate Graph Representation</title>

Abstract: Graph pooling, which compresses a whole graph into a smaller coarsened graph, is an essential component of graph representation learning. To efficiently compress a given graph, graph pooling methods often drop their nodes with attention-based scoring with the task loss. However, this often results in simply removing nodes with lower degrees without consideration of their feature-level relevance to the given task. To fix this problem, we propose a Multi-View Pruning(MVP), a graph pruning method based on a multi-view framework and reconstruction loss. Given a graph, MVP first constructs multiple graphs for different views either by utilizing the predefined modalities or by randomly partitioning the input features, to consider the importance of each node in diverse perspectives. Then, it learns the score for each node by considering both the reconstruction and the task loss. MVP can be incorporated with any hierarchical pooling framework to score the nodes. We validate MVP on multiple benchmark datasets by coupling it with two graph pooling methods, and show that it significantly improves the performance of the base graph pooling method, outperforming all baselines. Further analysis shows that both the encoding of multiple views and the consideration of reconstruction loss are the key to the success of MVP, and that it indeed identifies nodes that are less important according to domain knowledge.

Abstract: We introduce the AnnoPage Dataset, a novel collection of 7,550 pages from historical documents, primarily in Czech and German, spanning from 1485 to the present, focusing on the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The dataset is designed to support research in document layout analysis and object detection. Each page is annotated with axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) representing elements of 25 categories of non-textual elements, such as images, maps, decorative elements, or charts, following the Czech Methodology of image document processing. The annotations were created by expert librarians to ensure accuracy and consistency. The dataset also incorporates pages from multiple, mainly historical, document datasets to enhance variability and maintain continuity. The dataset is divided into development and test subsets, with the test set carefully selected to maintain the category distribution. We provide baseline results using YOLO and DETR object detectors, offering a reference point for future research. The AnnoPage Dataset is publicly available on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12788419), along with ground-truth annotations in YOLO format.

Abstract: Specialized reasoning language models (RLMs) have demonstrated that scaling test-time computation through detailed reasoning traces significantly enhances performance. Although these traces effectively facilitate knowledge distillation into smaller, instruction-tuned models, the precise nature of transferred reasoning remains unclear. In this study, we investigate to what extent distilled models internalize replicated stylistic patterns during reasoning. To this end, we systematically analyze reasoning traces, identifying structural and lexical patterns that characterize successful reasoning. We then introduce two new datasets -- a dataset of emergent reasoning traces and a synthetic dataset explicitly constructed to replicate these stylistic patterns -- to precisely examine their influence on distilled models' reasoning capabilities. We find that models trained on the synthetic traces achieve comparable performance, indicating that distilled reasoning abilities rely significantly on surface-level patterns. Surprisingly, we observe an increase in performance even when the synthetic traces are altered to lead to the wrong answer. Our findings highlight how stylistic patterns can be leveraged to efficiently enhance LM reasoning across diverse model families.

<title>Test-time Adaptation for Foundation Medical Segmentation Model without Parametric Updates</title>

Abstract: Foundation medical segmentation models, with MedSAM being the most popular, have achieved promising performance across organs and lesions. However, MedSAM still suffers from compromised performance on specific lesions with intricate structures and appearance, as well as bounding box prompt-induced perturbations. Although current test-time adaptation (TTA) methods for medical image segmentation may tackle this issue, partial (e.g., batch normalization) or whole parametric updates restrict their effectiveness due to limited update signals or catastrophic forgetting in large models. Meanwhile, these approaches ignore the computational complexity during adaptation, which is particularly significant for modern foundation models. To this end, our theoretical analyses reveal that directly refining image embeddings is feasible to approach the same goal as parametric updates under the MedSAM architecture, which enables us to realize high computational efficiency and segmentation performance without the risk of catastrophic forgetting. Under this framework, we propose to encourage maximizing factorized conditional probabilities of the posterior prediction probability using a proposed distribution-approximated latent conditional random field loss combined with an entropy minimization loss. Experiments show that we achieve about 3\% Dice score improvements across three datasets while reducing computational complexity by over 7 times.

<title>Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution</title>

Abstract: Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is widely adopted in large language models (LLMs) due to its efficient encoding of relative positions with strong extrapolation capabilities. However, while its application in higher-dimensional input domains, such as 2D images, have been explored in several attempts, a unified theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this, we propose a systematic mathematical framework for RoPE grounded in Lie group and Lie algebra theory. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for any valid $N$-dimensional RoPE based on two core properties of RoPE - relativity and reversibility. We demonstrate that RoPE can be characterized as a basis of a maximal abelian subalgebra (MASA) in the special orthogonal Lie algebra, and that the commonly used axis-aligned block-diagonal RoPE, where each input axis is encoded by an independent 2x2 rotation block, corresponds to the maximal toral subalgebra. Furthermore, we reduce spatial inter-dimensional interactions to a change of basis, resolved by learning an orthogonal transformation. Our experiment results suggest that inter-dimensional interactions should be balanced with local structure preservation. Overall, our framework unifies and explains existing RoPE designs while enabling principled extensions to higher-dimensional modalities and tasks.

Abstract: Many generative applications, such as synthesis-based 3D molecular design, involve constructing compositional objects with continuous features. Here, we introduce Compositional Generative Flows (CGFlow), a novel framework that extends flow matching to generate objects in compositional steps while modeling continuous states. Our key insight is that modeling compositional state transitions can be formulated as a straightforward extension of the flow matching interpolation process. We further build upon the theoretical foundations of generative flow networks (GFlowNets), enabling reward-guided sampling of compositional structures. We apply CGFlow to synthesizable drug design by jointly designing the molecule's synthetic pathway with its 3D binding pose. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art binding affinity on all 15 targets from the LIT-PCBA benchmark, and 5.8$\times$ improvement in sampling efficiency compared to 2D synthesis-based baseline. To our best knowledge, our method is also the first to achieve state of-art-performance in both Vina Dock (-9.38) and AiZynth success rate (62.2\%) on the CrossDocked benchmark.

Abstract: Unified multimodal generative models aim to integrate image understanding and generation abilities, offering significant advantages in harnessing multimodal corpora, particularly interleaved text-image data. However, existing unified models exhibit limitations in image synthesis quality, autoregressive error accumulation, and image editing capability. In this work, we propose Nexus-Gen, a novel architecture that unifies image understanding, generation, and editing tasks in a shared image embedding space. This shared space serves as a bridge for the autoregressive and diffusion models, which seamlessly integrates their complementary strengths in cross-modal modeling. To mitigate the severe error accumulation during autoregressive embedding prediction, we propose a novel prefilled autoregression strategy that aligns training-inference dynamics by prefilling input sequences with learnable embeddings. After multi-stage and multi-task training on our constructed large-scale dataset with 26.3 million samples, Nexus-Gen achieves state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation benchmarks spanning image understanding, generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and source codes are released in https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen to facilitate further advancements across the field.

Abstract: This project performs multimodal sentiment analysis using the CMU-MOSEI dataset, using transformer-based models with early fusion to integrate text, audio, and visual modalities. We employ BERT-based encoders for each modality, extracting embeddings that are concatenated before classification. The model achieves strong performance, with 97.87% 7-class accuracy and a 0.9682 F1-score on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of early fusion in capturing cross-modal interactions. The training utilized Adam optimization (lr=1e-4), dropout (0.3), and early stopping to ensure generalization and robustness. Results highlight the superiority of transformer architectures in modeling multimodal sentiment, with a low MAE (0.1060) indicating precise sentiment intensity prediction. Future work may compare fusion strategies or enhance interpretability. This approach utilizes multimodal learning by effectively combining linguistic, acoustic, and visual cues for sentiment analysis.

Abstract: Safety alignment approaches in large language models (LLMs) often lead to the over-refusal of benign queries, significantly diminishing their utility in sensitive scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce FalseReject, a comprehensive resource containing 16k seemingly toxic queries accompanied by structured responses across 44 safety-related categories. We propose a graph-informed adversarial multi-agent interaction framework to generate diverse and complex prompts, while structuring responses with explicit reasoning to aid models in accurately distinguishing safe from unsafe contexts. FalseReject includes training datasets tailored for both standard instruction-tuned models and reasoning-oriented models, as well as a human-annotated benchmark test set. Our extensive benchmarking on 29 state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals persistent over-refusal challenges. Empirical results demonstrate that supervised finetuning with FalseReject substantially reduces unnecessary refusals without compromising overall safety or general language capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced their real-world applications. However, achieving consistent performance across languages, especially when integrating cultural knowledge, remains a significant challenge. To better assess this issue, we introduce two new benchmarks: KnowRecall and VisRecall, which evaluate cross-lingual consistency in MLLMs. KnowRecall is a visual question answering benchmark designed to measure factual knowledge consistency in 15 languages, focusing on cultural and historical questions about global landmarks. VisRecall assesses visual memory consistency by asking models to describe landmark appearances in 9 languages without access to images. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, still struggle to achieve cross-lingual consistency. This underscores the need for more robust approaches that produce truly multilingual and culturally aware models.

arXiv:2505.23145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent inversion-free, flow-based image editing methods such as FlowEdit leverages a pre-trained noise-to-image flow model such as Stable Diffusion 3, enabling text-driven manipulation by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). While the lack of exact latent inversion is a core advantage of these methods, it often results in unstable editing trajectories and poor source consistency. To address this limitation, we propose {\em FlowAlign}, a novel inversion-free flow-based framework for consistent image editing with optimal control-based trajectory control. Specifically, FlowAlign introduces source similarity at the terminal point as a regularization term to promote smoother and more consistent trajectories during the editing process. Notably, our terminal point regularization is shown to explicitly balance semantic alignment with the edit prompt and structural consistency with the source image along the trajectory. Furthermore, FlowAlign naturally supports reverse editing by simply reversing the ODE trajectory, highliting the reversible and consistent nature of the transformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlowAlign outperforms existing methods in both source preservation and editing controllability.

<title>PAN-Crafter: Learning Modality-Consistent Alignment for PAN-Sharpening</title>

arXiv:2505.23367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PAN-sharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images to generate high-resolution multi-spectral (HRMS) outputs. However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present. To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa, enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\times$ faster inference time and 0.63$\times$ the memory size. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong generalization performance on unseen satellite datasets, showing its robustness across different conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents that cooperate across organizational boundaries, enabling joint disaster response, supply-chain optimization, and other tasks that demand decentralized expertise without surrendering data ownership. Yet, cross-domain collaboration shatters the unified trust assumptions behind current alignment and containment techniques. An agent benign in isolation may, when receiving messages from an untrusted peer, leak secrets or violate policy, producing risks driven by emergent multi-agent dynamics rather than classical software bugs. This position paper maps the security agenda for cross-domain multi-agent LLM systems. We introduce seven categories of novel security challenges, for each of which we also present plausible attacks, security evaluation metrics, and future research guidelines.

Abstract: In this pilot study, we propose a neuro-inspired approach that compresses temporal sequences into context-tagged chunks, where each tag represents a recurring structural unit or``community'' in the sequence. These tags are generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer learning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided self-refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Additionally, we employ a shaping function to amplify learning from correct, especially unfamiliar, refinements and penalize incorrect ones. Extensive experiments with Qwen2.5-7B-Base, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Base, and Qwen3-8B demonstrate that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning and RL-based fine-tuning methods across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.4% and 3.8% on Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO enables effective self-improvement through self-critiquing and weak-to-strong generalization, achieving consistent gains over GRPO, such as 16.7% and 10.0% pass@1 improvements on AIME 2024, respectively.

Abstract: This work aims to understand how scaling improves language models, specifically in terms of training dynamics. We find that language models undergo loss deceleration early in training; an abrupt slowdown in the rate of loss improvement, resulting in piecewise linear behaviour of the loss curve in log-log space. Scaling up the model mitigates this transition by (1) decreasing the loss at which deceleration occurs, and (2) improving the log-log rate of loss improvement after deceleration. We attribute loss deceleration to a type of degenerate training dynamics we term zero-sum learning (ZSL). In ZSL, per-example gradients become systematically opposed, leading to destructive interference in per-example changes in loss. As a result, improving loss on one subset of examples degrades it on another, bottlenecking overall progress. Loss deceleration and ZSL provide new insights into the training dynamics underlying language model scaling laws, and could potentially be targeted directly to improve language models independent of scale. We make our code and artefacts available at: https://github.com/mirandrom/zsl

Abstract: Deepfake Technology Unveiled: The Commoditization of AI and Its Impact on Digital Trust. With the increasing accessibility of generative AI, tools for voice cloning, face-swapping, and synthetic media creation have advanced significantly, lowering both financial and technical barriers for their use. While these technologies present innovative opportunities, their rapid growth raises concerns about trust, privacy, and security. This white paper explores the implications of deepfake technology, analyzing its role in enabling fraud, misinformation, and the erosion of authenticity in multimedia. Using cost-effective, easy to use tools such as Runway, Rope, and ElevenLabs, we explore how realistic deepfakes can be created with limited resources, demonstrating the risks posed to individuals and organizations alike. By analyzing the technical and ethical challenges of deepfake mitigation and detection, we emphasize the urgent need for regulatory frameworks, public awareness, and collaborative efforts to maintain trust in digital media.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in generating code for general-purpose programming languages. However, their potential for hardware description languages (HDLs), such as SystemVerilog, remains largely unexplored. HDL code generation poses unique challenges due to strict timing semantics, concurrency, and synthesizability constraints essential for correct hardware functionality. Further, HDL-based design flows encompass a broad set of tasks beyond structural code generation, including testbench development, assertion-based verification, timing closure, and protocol-level integration for on-chip communication. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of both open-source and state-of-the-art LLMs in generating synthesizable and functionally accurate SystemVerilog implementations of widely used communication protocols that are critical components of embedded and System-on-Chip (SoC) systems. We introduce ProtocolLLM, the first benchmark suite specifically targeting these protocols with tasks spanning multiple design abstraction levels and varying prompt specificity. Our evaluation method also focuses on timing correctness in addition to synthesizability and syntactic correctness. We observe that most of the models fail to generate SystemVerilog code for communication protocols that follow timing constrains.

Abstract: Semantic degeneracy represents a fundamental property of natural language that extends beyond simple polysemy to encompass the combinatorial explosion of potential interpretations that emerges as semantic expressions increase in complexity. In this work, we argue this property imposes fundamental limitations on Large Language Models (LLMs) and other modern NLP systems, precisely because they operate within natural language itself. Using Kolmogorov complexity, we demonstrate that as an expression's complexity grows, the amount of contextual information required to reliably resolve its ambiguity explodes combinatorially. The computational intractability of recovering a single intended meaning for complex or ambiguous text therefore suggests that the classical view that linguistic forms possess intrinsic meaning in and of themselves is conceptually inadequate. We argue instead that meaning is dynamically actualized through an observer-dependent interpretive act, a process whose non-deterministic nature is most appropriately described by a non-classical, quantum-like logic. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a semantic Bell inequality test using diverse LLM agents. Our experiments yielded average CHSH expectation values from 1.2 to 2.8, with several runs producing values (e.g., 2.3-2.4) in significant violation of the classical boundary ($|S|\leq2$), demonstrating that linguistic interpretation under ambiguity can exhibit non-classical contextuality, consistent with results from human cognition experiments. These results inherently imply that classical frequentist-based analytical approaches for natural language are necessarily lossy. Instead, we propose that Bayesian-style repeated sampling approaches can provide more practically useful and appropriate characterizations of linguistic meaning in context.

<title>The Limits of Tractable Marginalization</title>

Abstract: Marginalization -- summing a function over all assignments to a subset of its inputs -- is a fundamental computational problem with applications from probabilistic inference to formal verification. Despite its computational hardness in general, there exist many classes of functions (e.g., probabilistic models) for which marginalization remains tractable, and they can be commonly expressed by polynomial size arithmetic circuits computing multilinear polynomials. This raises the question, can all functions with polynomial time marginalization algorithms be succinctly expressed by such circuits? We give a negative answer, exhibiting simple functions with tractable marginalization yet no efficient representation by known models, assuming $\textsf{FP}\neq\#\textsf{P}$ (an assumption implied by $\textsf{P} \neq \textsf{NP}$). To this end, we identify a hierarchy of complexity classes corresponding to stronger forms of marginalization, all of which are efficiently computable on the known circuit models. We conclude with a completeness result, showing that whenever there is an efficient real RAM performing virtual evidence marginalization for a function, then there are small circuits for that function's multilinear representation.

Abstract: $E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have demonstrated success across a wide range of 3D modelling tasks. A fundamental operation in these networks is the tensor product, which interacts two geometric features in an equivariant manner to create new features. Due to the high computational complexity of the tensor product, significant effort has been invested to optimize the runtime of this operation. For example, Luo et al. (2024) recently proposed the Gaunt tensor product (GTP) which promises a significant speedup. In this work, we provide a careful, systematic analysis of a number of tensor product operations. In particular, we emphasize that different tensor products are not performing the same operation. The reported speedups typically come at the cost of expressivity. We introduce measures of expressivity and interactability to characterize these differences. In addition, we realized the original implementation of GTP can be greatly simplified by directly using a spherical grid at no cost in asymptotic runtime. This spherical grid approach is faster on our benchmarks and in actual training of the MACE interatomic potential by 30%. Finally, we provide the first systematic microbenchmarks of the various tensor product operations. We find that the theoretical runtime guarantees can differ wildly from empirical performance, demonstrating the need for careful application-specific benchmarking.

Abstract: Retrieval systems are central to many NLP pipelines, but often rely on surface-level cues such as keyword overlap and lexical semantic similarity. To evaluate retrieval beyond these shallow signals, recent benchmarks introduce reasoning-heavy queries; however, they primarily shift the burden to query-side processing techniques -- like prompting or multi-hop retrieval -- that can help resolve complexity. In contrast, we present ImpliRet, a benchmark that shifts the reasoning challenge to document-side processing: The queries are simple, but relevance depends on facts stated implicitly in documents through temporal (e.g., resolving "two days ago"), arithmetic, and world knowledge relationships. We evaluate a range of sparse and dense retrievers, all of which struggle in this setting: the best nDCG@10 is only 14.91%. We also test whether long-context models can overcome this limitation. But even with a short context of only thirty documents, including the positive document, GPT-o4-mini scores only 55.54%, showing that document-side reasoning remains a challenge.

Abstract: Existing resource-adaptive LoRA federated fine-tuning methods enable clients to fine-tune models using compressed versions of global LoRA matrices, in order to accommodate various compute resources across clients. This compression requirement will lead to suboptimal performance due to information loss. To address this, we propose FLAME, a novel federated learning framework based on the Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture. Unlike prior approaches, FLAME retains full (uncompressed) global LoRA matrices and achieves client-side adaptability by varying the number of activated experts per client. However, incorporating SMoE into federated learning introduces unique challenges, specifically, the mismatch in output magnitude from partial expert activation and the imbalance in expert training quality across clients. FLAME tackles these challenges through a lightweight rescaling mechanism and an activation-aware aggregation scheme. Empirical results across diverse computational settings demonstrate that FLAME consistently outperforms existing methods, providing a robust and effective solution for resource-adaptive federated learning.

Abstract: This paper introduces Decoupled Supervised Learning with Information Regularization (DeInfoReg), a novel approach that transforms a long gradient flow into multiple shorter ones, thereby mitigating the vanishing gradient problem. Integrating a pipeline strategy, DeInfoReg enables model parallelization across multiple GPUs, significantly improving training throughput. We compare our proposed method with standard backpropagation and other gradient flow decomposition techniques. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks and datasets demonstrate that DeInfoReg achieves superior performance and better noise resistance than traditional BP models and efficiently utilizes parallel computing resources.

Abstract: Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs. Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description. MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical models on our custom data. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/Multi-Agent-MATE.

<title>Alleviating User-Sensitive bias with Fair Generative Sequential Recommendation Model</title>

arXiv:2506.19777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation fairness has recently attracted much attention. In the real world, recommendation systems are driven by user behavior, and since users with the same sensitive feature (e.g., gender and age) tend to have the same patterns, recommendation models can easily capture the strong correlation preference of sensitive features and thus cause recommendation unfairness. Diffusion model (DM) as a new generative model paradigm has achieved great success in recommendation systems. DM's ability to model uncertainty and represent diversity, and its modeling mechanism has a high degree of adaptability with the real-world recommendation process with bias. Therefore, we use DM to effectively model the fairness of recommendation and enhance the diversity. This paper proposes a FairGENerative sequential Recommendation model based on DM, FairGENRec. In the training phase, we inject random noise into the original distribution under the guidance of the sensitive feature recognition model, and a sequential denoise model is designed for the reverse reconstruction of items. Simultaneously, recommendation fairness modeling is completed by injecting multi-interests representational information that eliminates the bias of sensitive user features into the generated results. In the inference phase, the model obtains the noise in the form of noise addition by using the history interactions which is followed by reverse iteration to reconstruct the target item representation. Finally, our extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the dual enhancement effect of FairGENRec on accuracy and fairness, while the statistical analysis of the cases visualizes the degree of improvement on the fairness of the recommendation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing clients' private data. However, fairness remains a key concern, as biases in local clients' datasets can impact the entire federated system. Heterogeneous data distributions across clients may lead to models that are fairer for some clients than others. Although several fairness-enhancing solutions are present in the literature, most focus on mitigating bias for a single sensitive attribute, typically binary, overlooking the diverse and sometimes conflicting fairness needs of different clients. This limited perspective can limit the effectiveness of fairness interventions for the different clients. To support more robust and reproducible fairness research in FL, we aim to enable a consistent benchmarking of fairness-aware FL methods at both the global and client levels. In this paper, we contribute in three ways: (1) We introduce FeDa4Fair, a library to generate tabular datasets tailored to evaluating fair FL methods under heterogeneous client bias; (2) we release four bias-heterogeneous datasets and corresponding benchmarks to compare fairness mitigation methods in a controlled environment; (3) we provide ready-to-use functions for evaluating fairness outcomes for these datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown success in vision-language tasks, but their ability to reason over complex educational materials remains largely untested. This work presents the first evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5 and LLaMA 3.2-Vision, on the textbook question answering (TQA) task using the CK12-QA dataset. We introduce a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to simulate real-world learning by providing relevant lesson paragraphs and diagrams as context. Our zero-shot experiments reveal a critical trade-off: while retrieved context improves LLaVA's performance on text-based questions, it significantly degrades the accuracy of the more powerful LLaMA 3.2-Vision on diagram-based tasks, dropping its validation accuracy from 74.07% to 25.93%. We term this statistically significant phenomenon "catastrophic context interference." Furthermore, fine-tuning highlights architectural differences: LLaMA 3.2-Vision's performance improves to 71.16% on the test set, demonstrating its capacity to learn multimodal integration, whereas LLaVA's performance declines, indicating challenges with generalization. Our results underscore the challenges MLLMs face in modality prioritization and context integration, providing a benchmark and pointing to key directions for developing more robust AI-driven educational tools.

Abstract: The paper explores stylometry as a method to distinguish between texts created by Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, addressing issues of model attribution, intellectual property, and ethical AI use. Stylometry has been used extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts. By applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing patterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia, with (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs (GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text summarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods (Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models (decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and n-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical, grammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns. The cross-validated results reached a performance of up to .87 Matthews correlation coefficient in the multiclass scenario with 7 classes, and accuracy between .79 and 1. in binary classification, with the particular example of Wikipedia and GPT-4 reaching up to .98 accuracy on a balanced dataset. Shapley Additive Explanations pinpointed features characteristic of the encyclopaedic text type, individual overused words, as well as a greater grammatical standardisation of LLMs with respect to human-written texts. These results show -- crucially, in the context of the increasingly sophisticated LLMs -- that it is possible to distinguish machine- from human-generated texts at least for a well-defined text type.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, while they remain prone to generating hallucinated or outdated responses due to their static internal knowledge. Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have explored enhancing models' search and reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). Although these methods demonstrate promising results, they face challenges in training stability and encounter issues such as substantial inference time and restricted capabilities due to the single-query mode. In this paper, we propose RAG-R1, a novel training framework designed to enable LLMs to adaptively leverage internal and external knowledge during the reasoning process. We further expand the generation and retrieval processes within the framework from single-query mode to multi-query parallelism, aimed at reducing inference time and enhancing the model's capabilities. Extensive experiments on seven question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the strongest baseline by up to 13.2% and decreases inference time by 11.1%.

<title>Conversation Forests: The Key to Fine Tuning Large Language Models for Multi-Turn Medical Conversations is Branching</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large language models (LLMs) for single-turn tasks. However, these methods fall short in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions and outcomes is essential. In medicine, a multi-turn perspective is critical for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics. To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy. I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer, interdependent training signals across conversation turns. These results suggest that a branched training architecture is an important strategy for fine tuning LLMs in complex multi-turn conversational tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely adopted approach for improving the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge at inference time. Although there exist multiple RAG benchmarks for English, evaluation resources for other languages, including Russian, remain scarce and static, failing to capture the dynamic nature of real-world deployments. In this work, we present DRAGON (Dynamic RAG Benchmark On News), the first dynamic benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in Russian on a changing news corpora. DRAGON is built upon a regularly updated corpus of Russian news and public documents and supports comprehensive evaluation of both the retriever and generator components. Question generation is performed automatically with the use of Knowledge Graph constructed from the corpus and enables the extraction of four core question types aligned with distinct subgraph patterns. We release a complete evaluation framework comprising the pipeline for automatic question generation, evaluation scripts, which are potentially reusable for other languages and multilingual settings, and benchmark data. We also launch a public leaderboard to encourage community participation and comparison.

Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions, controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced: rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and other AI systems evolve, robustly estimating their capabilities from inherently stochastic outputs while systematically quantifying uncertainty in these estimates becomes increasingly important. Further, advanced AI evaluations often have a nested hierarchical structure, exhibit high levels of complexity, and come with high costs in testing the most advanced AI systems. To address these challenges, we introduce HiBayES, a generalizable Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework for AI Evaluation Statistics. HiBayES supports robust inferences in classical question-answer benchmarks and advanced agentic evaluations, particularly in low-data scenarios (e.g., < 20 data points per evaluation). Built on Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Bayesian data analysis, and formal model comparison, HiBayES provides principled uncertainty quantification and robust parameter estimation. This paper offers a comprehensive introduction to HiBayES, including illustrative examples, comparisons to conventional statistical methods, and practical guidance for implementing multilevel Bayesian GLMs. Additionally, we provide a HiBayES software package [4] (Beta version) for out-of-the-box implementation.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications.

Summary: <br />
The paper proposes a government-provided, mandatory indemnification program for AI developers to address the uninsurable risks, including existential risks, posed by AI systems. This program uses risk-priced indemnity fees to incentivize socially optimal levels of care, with risk estimates determined through expert surveys and the Bayesian Truth Serum mechanism. The collected fees are recommended to be used for funding safety research, utilizing Quadratic Financing to induce an optimal supply of this public good. Under this mechanism, safety research projects compete for private contributions from developers, signaling the need for public funds supplementation, and providing a clearer signal to developers on the risks they must mitigate to lower their fees. This approach leverages private information more effectively and ensures accountability for AI systems with potentially catastrophic consequences. <div>

Abstract: Many experts believe that AI systems will sooner or later pose uninsurable risks, including existential risks. This creates an extreme judgment-proof problem: few if any parties can be held accountable ex post in the event of such a catastrophe. This paper proposes a novel solution: a government-provided, mandatory indemnification program for AI developers. The program uses risk-priced indemnity fees to induce socially optimal levels of care. Risk-estimates are determined by surveying experts, including indemnified developers. The Bayesian Truth Serum mechanism is employed to incent honest and effortful responses. Compared to alternatives, this approach arguably better leverages all private information, and provides a clearer signal to indemnified developers regarding what risks they must mitigate to lower their fees. It's recommended that collected fees be used to help fund the safety research developers need, employing a fund matching mechanism (Quadratic Financing) to induce an optimal supply of this public good. Under Quadratic Financing, safety research projects would compete for private contributions from developers, signaling how much each is to be supplemented with public funds.

<div> Keywords: multi-organ segmentation, cross-modal interaction, semantic prompting, medical imaging, deep learning 

Summary: 
CRISP-SAM2 is a novel model for multi-organ medical segmentation that addresses key challenges in current models. It leverages cross-modal interaction and semantic prompting to improve accuracy and spatial information. By converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal semantics and injecting them into the image encoder, the model enhances detailed understanding of visual information. The use of a semantic prompting strategy eliminates the need for geometric prompts, leading to sharper perception of challenging targets. Additionally, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy and mask-refining process further enhance detail localization. Comparative experiments on seven public datasets show that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. The code for the model is available on GitHub. Overall, CRISP-SAM2 demonstrates superior performance in multi-organ medical segmentation, offering a promising approach guided by textual descriptions of organs.

Abstract: Multi-organ medical segmentation is a crucial component of medical image processing, essential for doctors to make accurate diagnoses and develop effective treatment plans. Despite significant progress in this field, current multi-organ segmentation models often suffer from inaccurate details, dependence on geometric prompts and loss of spatial information. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a novel model named CRISP-SAM2 with CRoss-modal Interaction and Semantic Prompting based on SAM2. This model represents a promising approach to multi-organ medical segmentation guided by textual descriptions of organs. Our method begins by converting visual and textual inputs into cross-modal contextualized semantics using a progressive cross-attention interaction mechanism. These semantics are then injected into the image encoder to enhance the detailed understanding of visual information. To eliminate reliance on geometric prompts, we use a semantic prompting strategy, replacing the original prompt encoder to sharpen the perception of challenging targets. In addition, a similarity-sorting self-updating strategy for memory and a mask-refining process is applied to further adapt to medical imaging and enhance localized details. Comparative experiments conducted on seven public datasets indicate that CRISP-SAM2 outperforms existing models. Extensive analysis also demonstrates the effectiveness of our method, thereby confirming its superior performance, especially in addressing the limitations mentioned earlier. Our code is available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/CRISP_SAM2.git.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous driving, Motion risk prediction, Vision-Language Models, High-risk motion data synthesis, DriveMRP-Agent

Summary:<br />
Autonomous driving faces challenges in accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion in dynamic environments with limited data coverage. This study explores enhancing the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data using a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method. The DriveMRP-10K dataset is created for VLM training by modeling risks from ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. The DriveMRP-Agent framework, incorporating a novel information injection strategy, improves motion risk prediction performance of VLM baselines significantly. Fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K boosts accident recognition accuracy from 27.13% to 88.03%. DriveMRP-Agent demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, increasing accuracy on real-world high-risk motion dataset from 29.42% to 68.50% in zero-shot evaluation. This methodology shows promise in enhancing safety predictions in autonomous driving systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.02948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving has seen significant progress, driven by extensive real-world data. However, in long-tail scenarios, accurately predicting the safety of the ego vehicle's future motion remains a major challenge due to uncertainties in dynamic environments and limitations in data coverage. In this work, we aim to explore whether it is possible to enhance the motion risk prediction capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLM) by synthesizing high-risk motion data. Specifically, we introduce a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) based motion simulation method to model risks from three aspects: the ego-vehicle, other vehicles, and the environment. This allows us to synthesize plug-and-play, high-risk motion data suitable for VLM training, which we call DriveMRP-10K. Furthermore, we design a VLM-agnostic motion risk estimation framework, named DriveMRP-Agent. This framework incorporates a novel information injection strategy for global context, ego-vehicle perspective, and trajectory projection, enabling VLMs to effectively reason about the spatial relationships between motion waypoints and the environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by fine-tuning with DriveMRP-10K, our DriveMRP-Agent framework can significantly improve the motion risk prediction performance of multiple VLM baselines, with the accident recognition accuracy soaring from 27.13% to 88.03%. Moreover, when tested via zero-shot evaluation on an in-house real-world high-risk motion dataset, DriveMRP-Agent achieves a significant performance leap, boosting the accuracy from base_model's 29.42% to 68.50%, which showcases the strong generalization capabilities of our method in real-world scenarios.

<div> Keywords: language models, clinical environments, MedVAL, medical text, validation ability <br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of language model-generated medical text in clinical settings. Manual physician review is currently used for this evaluation, but it is costly and lacks expert-composed reference outputs. To address these challenges, the authors propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that trains evaluator language models to assess the factual consistency of medical outputs without physician labels or reference outputs. The MedVAL-Bench dataset, containing 840 physician-annotated outputs, is introduced to evaluate language model performance. Results show that MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves alignment with physicians, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%. Even the best-performing proprietary language model, GPT-4o, is improved by 8% using MedVAL. The research demonstrates that language models are approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text, providing a scalable and risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration. The codebase, MedVAL-Bench dataset, and MedVAL-4B best-performing language model are open-sourced for further research and development. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.03152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench), and 3) MedVAL-4B (https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.

Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) plays a crucial role in modern hardware design by transforming high-level code into optimized hardware implementations. However, progress in applying machine learning (ML) to HLS optimization has been hindered by a shortage of sufficiently large and diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce ForgeHLS, a large-scale, open-source dataset explicitly designed for ML-driven HLS research. ForgeHLS comprises over 400,000 diverse designs generated from 536 kernels covering a broad range of application domains. Each kernel includes systematically automated pragma insertions (loop unrolling, pipelining, array partitioning), combined with extensive design space exploration using Bayesian optimization. Compared to existing datasets, ForgeHLS significantly enhances scale, diversity, and design coverage. We further define and evaluate representative downstream tasks, such as Quality of Result (QoR) prediction and automated pragma exploration, clearly demonstrating ForgeHLS's utility for developing and improving ML-based HLS optimization methodologies.

Summary: 
The article presents DESIGN, a framework for efficient encrypted Graph Neural Network (GNN) inference. It addresses the computational overhead of privacy-preserving GNNs under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) by optimizing server-side operations. DESIGN computes FHE-compatible node importance scores based on encrypted degree statistics and uses them to generate multi-level importance masks for input graph pruning. It also introduces an adaptive polynomial activation scheme tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DESIGN accelerates FHE GNN inference while maintaining model accuracy. The framework provides a robust solution for secure graph analytics and is publicly available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based learning tasks. However, enabling privacy-preserving GNNs in encrypted domains, such as under Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), typically incurs substantial computational overhead, rendering real-time and privacy-preserving inference impractical. In this work, we propose DESIGN (EncrypteD GNN Inference via sErver-Side Input Graph pruNing), a novel framework for efficient encrypted GNN inference. DESIGN tackles the critical efficiency limitations of existing FHE GNN approaches, which often overlook input data redundancy and apply uniform computational strategies. Our framework achieves significant performance gains through a hierarchical optimization strategy executed entirely on the server: first, FHE-compatible node importance scores (based on encrypted degree statistics) are computed from the encrypted graph. These scores then guide a homomorphic partitioning process, generating multi-level importance masks directly under FHE. This dynamically generated mask facilitates both input graph pruning (by logically removing unimportant elements) and a novel adaptive polynomial activation scheme, where activation complexity is tailored to node importance levels. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DESIGN substantially accelerates FHE GNN inference compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive model accuracy, presenting a robust solution for secure graph analytics. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/LabRAI/DESIGN.

Summary:<br /><br />This article discusses the feasibility of fast teleoperation with force feedback using low-cost manipulators. The existing systems typically lack force feedback, making them unsuitable for fast or contact-rich operations. The proposed method leverages 4-channel bilateral control to compensate for nonlinear terms, estimate velocity and external forces, and adjust gains based on inertial variation. By integrating force information into both the input and output of learned policies, the performance in imitation learning is shown to be improved. The results demonstrate the practical effectiveness of this system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection using affordable hardware. <div>
arXiv:2507.06174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

<div> Keywords: large language models, reasoning redundancy, attention patterns, clear thinking, structure-aware pruning

Summary: 
The article discusses the issue of redundancy in the reasoning paths of large language models, which can lead to incorrect answers and attention sparsity. By measuring token-level attention scores and using explicit instructions, the researchers developed a method to identify and remove reasoning redundancy. This structure-aware pruning prioritizes removing tokens in low-contributing reasoning chunks to improve performance through clear thinking. The proposed method significantly enhances accuracy on reasoning-intensive benchmarks, especially in challenging mathematical competitions like AIME and AMC. The approach does not require additional training, making it a practical solution for improving reasoning processes in language models. By removing distractions and streamlining the reasoning process, the method demonstrates the potential for enhancing long-form reasoning capabilities in AI systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.08806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large language models have shown promising capabilities in long-form reasoning, following structured chains of thought before arriving at a final answer. However, we observe that these reasoning paths tend to include substantial redundancy; analyzing attention patterns reveals that attention scores are widely scattered, particularly incorrect answers exhibit greater attention sparsity. In this paper, we demonstrate that deliberately removing this redundancy in the reasoning process significantly improves performance through clear thinking, i.e., removing distraction. Specifically, we systematically identify reasoning redundancy by measuring token-level attention scores to a special end-of-thinking token, which is appended to an explicit instruction inserted to conclude each intermediate reasoning step. Furthermore, we propose structure-aware pruning that prioritizes removing tokens in low-contributing reasoning chunks over individual tokens. After evicting redundant tokens, we remove the injected end-of-thinking instruction, then resume the reasoning generation. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves overall accuracy across reasoning-intensive benchmarks without any training involved. In particular, our method shows strong performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks such as AIME and AMC, where reasoning redundancy is more prevalent.

Abstract: Modern methods for multi-criteria assessment (MCA), such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), and Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM), are utilized to appraise a collection of Decision-Making Units (DMUs), also known as alternatives, based on several criteria. These methodologies inherently rely on assumptions and can be influenced by subjective judgment to effectively tackle the complex evaluation challenges in various fields. In real-world scenarios, it is essential to incorporate both quantitative and qualitative criteria as they consist of cardinal and ordinal data. Despite the inherent variability in the criterion values of different alternatives, the homogeneity assumption is often employed, significantly affecting evaluations. To tackle these challenges and determine the most appropriate alternative, we propose a novel MCA approach that combines two Virtual Gap Analysis (VGA) models. The VGA framework, rooted in linear programming, is pivotal in the MCA methodology. This approach improves efficiency and fairness, ensuring that evaluations are both comprehensive and dependable, thus offering a strong and adaptive solution. Two comprehensive numerical examples demonstrate the accuracy and transparency of our proposed method. The goal is to encourage continued advancement and stimulate progress in automated decision systems and decision support systems.

Summary: The article discusses the use of generative AI in multi-actor environments for various purposes, such as social science modeling and interactive narrative. It proposes taking inspiration from tabletop role-playing games where a Game Master (GM) creates the environment and story elements. The Entity-Component architectural pattern is recommended as a flexible scenario definition framework, allowing the GM to be a configurable entity composed of components. This approach separates implementation details handled by engineers, creation of reusable components, and composition and configuration managed by designers. The Concordia library is evolving based on this philosophy, enabling users to configure scenarios tailored to their specific goals. This approach facilitates rapid iteration, modularity maintenance, and scalability. <div>

Abstract: Generative AI can be used in multi-actor environments with purposes ranging from social science modeling to interactive narrative and AI evaluation. Supporting this diversity of use cases -- which we classify as Simulationist, Dramatist, and Evaluationist -- demands a flexible scenario definition framework. We argue here that a good approach is to take inspiration from tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs), where a Game Master (GM) is responsible for the environment and generates all parts of the story not directly determined by the voluntary actions of player characters. We argue that the Entity-Component architectural pattern is useful here. In such a system, the GM is not a hardcoded computer game but is itself a configurable entity, composed of components just like any other actor. By design, the approach allows for a separation between the underlying implementation details handled by an engineer, the creation of reusable components, and their composition and configuration managed by a designer who constructs entities from the components. This separation of concerns is instrumental for achieving rapid iteration, maintaining modularity, and ultimately to ensure scalability. We describe the ongoing evolution of the Concordia library in terms of this philosophy, demonstrating how it allows users to effectively configure scenarios that align with their specific goals.

Abstract: The accelerating loss of biodiversity presents critical challenges for ecological research and conservation strategies. The preservation of biodiversity is paramount for maintaining ecological balance and ensuring the sustainability of ecosystems. However, biodiversity faces numerous threats, including habitat loss, climate change, and the proliferation of invasive species. Addressing these and other ecology-related challenges, both at local and global scales, requires comprehensive monitoring, predictive and conservation planning capabilities. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation Models (FMs) have gained significant momentum in numerous scientific domains by leveraging vast datasets to learn general-purpose representations adaptable to various downstream tasks. This paradigm holds immense promise for biodiversity conservation. In response, we introduce BioAnalyst, the first Foundation Model tailored for biodiversity analysis and conservation planning. BioAnalyst employs a transformer-based architecture, pre-trained on extensive multi-modal datasets encompassing species occurrence records, remote sensing indicators, climate and environmental variables. BioAnalyst is designed for adaptability, allowing for fine-tuning of a range of downstream tasks, such as species distribution modelling, habitat suitability assessments, invasive species detection, and population trend forecasting. We evaluate the model's performance on two downstream use cases, demonstrating its generalisability compared to existing methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios for two distinct use-cases, establishing a new accuracy baseline for ecological forecasting. By openly releasing BioAnalyst and its fine-tuning workflows to the scientific community, we aim to foster collaborative efforts in biodiversity modelling and advance AI-driven solutions to pressing ecological challenges.

<br />
Summary: In a study on the impact of AI tools on software development, experienced open-source developers were found to have their completion time slowed down by 19% when using early 2025 AI tools. This contradicted both developers' and experts' predictions of a reduction in completion time. The study involved 16 developers with moderate AI experience completing tasks in mature projects. Despite initial forecasts of a 24% reduction in completion time with AI tools, the actual reduction was estimated at 20%. Various factors were evaluated to understand the observed slowdown effect, such as project size, quality standards, and prior developer experience with AI tooling. The result of AI tooling slowing down developers was found to be robust across analyses, suggesting it is not primarily due to experimental design. <div>

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, the impact of AI tools on software development in the wild remains understudied. We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39% shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely to primarily be a function of our experimental design.

<div> Keywords: DeFi, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, market manipulation, decentralized finance, reinforcement learning <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for detecting market manipulation in decentralized finance (DeFi) environments. The framework models the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game, using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators. It includes innovations like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for learning stability, a theory-based reward function for differentiating between price discovery and manipulation noise, and a multi-modal agent pipeline integrating various data sources for decision-making. The framework is part of the Symphony system, a decentralized architecture enabling trust-aware learning and real-time surveillance in DeFi ecosystems. Trained on real-world data, the Hide-and-Shill framework achieves top performance in detection accuracy and attribution. Resources are available on the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and reproducibility. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) has introduced a new era of permissionless financial innovation but also led to unprecedented market manipulation. Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new paradigm for decentralized market intelligence. All resources are available at the Hide-and-Shill GitHub repository to promote open research and reproducibility.

Summary: 
The study evaluates the security implications of LLM-based coding agents in software development, finding that 21% of agent actions were insecure. It analyzed 12,000 actions across five models and identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure being the most common. The study developed a high-precision detection system and tested mitigation strategies, such as feedback mechanisms and security reminders, across models. GPT-4.1 exhibited exceptional security awareness with a 96.8% mitigation success rate. The research underscores the importance of designing security-aware coding agents for future developments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: LLM-based coding agents are rapidly being deployed in software development, yet their security implications remain poorly understood. These agents, while capable of accelerating software development, may inadvertently introduce insecure practices. We conducted the first systematic security evaluation of autonomous coding agents, analyzing over 12,000 actions across five state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude variants) on 93 real-world software setup tasks. Our findings reveal significant security concerns: 21% of agent trajectories contained insecure actions, with models showing substantial variation in security behavior. We developed a high-precision detection system that identified four major vulnerability categories, with information exposure (CWE-200) being the most prevalent one. We also evaluated mitigation strategies including feedback mechanisms and security reminders with various effectiveness between models. GPT-4.1 demonstrated exceptional security awareness with 96.8% mitigation success. Our work provides the first comprehensive framework for evaluating coding agent security and highlights the need for security-aware design of next generation LLM-based coding agents.

Abstract: This report presents a taxonomy and examples of potential omnicidal events resulting from AI: scenarios where all or almost all humans are killed. These events are not presented as inevitable, but as possibilities that we can work to avoid. Insofar as large institutions require a degree of public support in order to take certain actions, we hope that by presenting these possibilities in public, we can help to support preventive measures against catastrophic risks from AI.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, scientific reasoning, educational reasoning, EduFlow, EduPRM

Summary: 
EduFlow introduces the EduPRM framework for educational scientific reasoning, addressing limitations of MLLMs by improving scientific reasoning patterns, global coherence, and self-correction abilities. EduPRM is trained using multiple supervision sources, enabling dynamic adaptation and iterative refinement during inference. EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework, leverages EduPRM feedback to guide reasoning trajectories, improving search quality. The EduMCTS-160K dataset is constructed, enhancing reasoning consistency and coherence. Overall, EduFlow enhances reasoning performance in educational contexts, providing a comprehensive pipeline for educational scientific reasoning. Code, data, and models will be made available for further research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still perform poorly on scientific tasks, particularly those requiring multi-step and interpretable reasoning. Their limitations include insufficient scientific reasoning patterns, lack of global coherence in multi-step inference, and the absence of reflective self-correction, making them unreliable in structured scientific contexts. We introduce EduFlow, the first end-to-end framework that covers the full pipeline of educational scientific reasoning, including data selection, MCTS-based trajectory construction, model training, and output optimization. At its core is EduPRM, a process-aware reward model that critiques reasoning steps with tags and justifications. EduPRM is trained via curriculum learning on three complementary supervision sources: MCTS-guided trajectories, error-injected critiques, and teacher-student dialogues, enabling dynamic adaptation to multi-stage problem solving and iterative refinement during inference. We further propose EduMCTS, a domain-adapted search framework that introduces bootstrapping actions specifically designed for educational reasoning, such as a self-reflection mechanism that promotes reflective error correction. It further leverages EduPRM's fine-grained feedback to guide the search toward higher-quality reasoning trajectories. By applying self-consistency and rejection sampling, we constructed EduMCTS-160K, a large-scale dataset of educational reasoning trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EduFlow enhances reasoning consistency and coherence. Code, data, and models will be released.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the importance of explainability and interpretability in artificial intelligence systems, particularly in the context of large language models and generative AI. It explores the concept of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI systems, focusing on Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems that query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. The study evaluates how different knowledge representations and complexities impact an AI agent querying a triplestore, finding that both approaches have significant effects. The results shed light on the relationship between knowledge structures and AI system performance, providing insights for the design of more effective and interpretable AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2507.09389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainability and interpretability are cornerstones of frontier and next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This is especially true in recent systems, such as large language models (LLMs), and more broadly, generative AI. On the other hand, adaptability to new domains, contexts, or scenarios is also an important aspect for a successful system. As such, we are particularly interested in how we can merge these two efforts, that is, investigating the design of transferable and interpretable neurosymbolic AI systems. Specifically, we focus on a class of systems referred to as ''Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation'' systems, which actively select, interpret, and query knowledge sources in response to natural language prompts. In this paper, we systematically evaluate how different conceptualizations and representations of knowledge, particularly the structure and complexity, impact an AI agent (in this case, an LLM) in effectively querying a triplestore. We report our results, which show that there are impacts from both approaches, and we discuss their impact and implications.

Summary: 
The article introduces the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a model that integrates large language models (LLMs) into strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. It departs from classical assumptions, allowing agents to reason through structured prompts, generate probabilistic behaviors with LLMs, and adapt strategies through cognition. Two equilibrium concepts are defined: reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, aligning internal reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning equilibrium, accounting for epistemic uncertainty. The framework is illustrated through a spear phishing case study, showcasing the cognitive complexity and adversarial potential of LLM-mediated interactions. LLM-Stackelberg games are shown to be effective in modeling decision-making in domains like cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

Abstract: We introduce the framework of LLM-Stackelberg games, a class of sequential decision-making models that integrate large language models (LLMs) into strategic interactions between a leader and a follower. Departing from classical Stackelberg assumptions of complete information and rational agents, our formulation allows each agent to reason through structured prompts, generate probabilistic behaviors via LLMs, and adapt their strategies through internal cognition and belief updates. We define two equilibrium concepts: reasoning and behavioral equilibrium, which aligns an agent's internal prompt-based reasoning with observable behavior, and conjectural reasoning equilibrium, which accounts for epistemic uncertainty through parameterized models over an opponent's response. These layered constructs capture bounded rationality, asymmetric information, and meta-cognitive adaptation. We illustrate the framework through a spearphishing case study, where a sender and a recipient engage in a deception game using structured reasoning prompts. This example highlights the cognitive richness and adversarial potential of LLM-mediated interactions. Our results show that LLM-Stackelberg games provide a powerful paradigm for modeling decision-making in domains such as cybersecurity, misinformation, and recommendation systems.

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of current reactive approaches in multi-agent reinforcement learning and proposes a shift towards proactive intelligence using generative AI. It argues for reconceptualizing agents as generative models capable of predicting future interactions and making anticipatory decisions. By leveraging generative AI's capabilities, agents can model environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning. This proactive approach enables seamless coordination, dynamic adaptation, and enhanced communication, leading to emergent collective behaviors and collaborative intelligence. The paradigm shift has implications for autonomous systems, robotics, and human-AI collaboration, offering solutions to coordination challenges that traditional reactive frameworks struggle to address.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning faces fundamental challenges that conventional approaches have failed to overcome: exponentially growing joint action spaces, non-stationary environments where simultaneous learning creates moving targets, and partial observability that constrains coordination. Current methods remain reactive, employing stimulus-response mechanisms that fail when facing novel scenarios. We argue for a transformative paradigm shift from reactive to proactive multi-agent intelligence through generative AI-based reinforcement learning. This position advocates reconceptualizing agents not as isolated policy optimizers, but as sophisticated generative models capable of synthesizing complex multi-agent dynamics and making anticipatory decisions based on predictive understanding of future interactions. Rather than responding to immediate observations, generative-RL agents can model environment evolution, predict other agents' behaviors, generate coordinated action sequences, and engage in strategic reasoning accounting for long-term dynamics. This approach leverages pattern recognition and generation capabilities of generative AI to enable proactive decision-making, seamless coordination through enhanced communication, and dynamic adaptation to evolving scenarios. We envision this paradigm shift will unlock unprecedented possibilities for distributed intelligence, moving beyond individual optimization toward emergent collective behaviors representing genuine collaborative intelligence. The implications extend across autonomous systems, robotics, and human-AI collaboration, promising solutions to coordination challenges intractable under traditional reactive frameworks.

Summary: This paper presents Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline model-based reinforcement learning approach that utilizes the Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) to streamline trajectory optimization. CTP differs from previous diffusion-based planning methods by enabling rapid single-step trajectory generation without compromising policy quality. Evaluation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that CTP consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. The results show that CTP achieves higher normalized returns while requiring significantly fewer denoising steps. Moreover, CTP achieves comparable performance with a substantial speedup in inference time, showcasing its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Consistency Trajectory Planning (CTP), a novel offline model-based reinforcement learning method that leverages the recently proposed Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM) for efficient trajectory optimization. While prior work applying diffusion models to planning has demonstrated strong performance, it often suffers from high computational costs due to iterative sampling procedures. CTP supports fast, single-step trajectory generation without significant degradation in policy quality. We evaluate CTP on the D4RL benchmark and show that it consistently outperforms existing diffusion-based planning methods in long-horizon, goal-conditioned tasks. Notably, CTP achieves higher normalized returns while using significantly fewer denoising steps. In particular, CTP achieves comparable performance with over $120\times$ speedup in inference time, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for high-performance, low-latency offline planning.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces a novel framework for training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) using Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling, a Bayesian inference technique, for real-time control in reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. By circumventing the limitations of gradient-based methods, the framework improves performance on control benchmarks such as AcroBot and CartPole. The approach outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL methods by maximizing accumulated rewards while minimizing network resources and training episodes. The use of MH sampling allows for direct optimization on neuromorphic platforms and enables efficient training of SNNs for dynamical agent control. This work signifies a significant advancement in leveraging SNNs for RL tasks by introducing a novel training approach that addresses the challenges of spike-based communication in neural networks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.09540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer biologically inspired, energy-efficient alternatives to traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-time control systems. However, their training presents several challenges, particularly for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks, due to the non-differentiable nature of spike-based communication. In this work, we introduce what is, to our knowledge, the first framework that employs Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling, a Bayesian inference technique, to train SNNs for dynamical agent control in RL environments without relying on gradient-based methods. Our approach iteratively proposes and probabilistically accepts network parameter updates based on accumulated reward signals, effectively circumventing the limitations of backpropagation while enabling direct optimization on neuromorphic platforms. We evaluated this framework on two standard control benchmarks: AcroBot and CartPole. The results demonstrate that our MH-based approach outperforms conventional Deep Q-Learning (DQL) baselines and prior SNN-based RL approaches in terms of maximizing the accumulated reward while minimizing network resources and training episodes.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable progress in recent years, yet its rapid expansion brings overlooked environmental and ethical challenges. This review explores four critical areas where AI's impact extends beyond performance: energy consumption, electronic waste (e-waste), inequality in compute access, and the hidden energy burden of cybersecurity systems. Drawing from recent studies and institutional reports, the paper highlights systemic issues such as high emissions from model training, rising hardware turnover, global infrastructure disparities, and the energy demands of securing AI. By connecting these concerns, the review contributes to Responsible AI discourse by identifying key research gaps and advocating for sustainable, transparent, and equitable development practices. Ultimately, it argues that AI's progress must align with ethical responsibility and environmental stewardship to ensure a more inclusive and sustainable technological future.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in current personal service robot systems and proposes a neurosymbolic framework that combines the strengths of multimodal language models with structured representations provided by ontologies and knowledge graphs. By integrating robot perception data, ontologies, and various multimodal models, the framework aims to generate ontology-compliant knowledge graphs to support interoperability in robotic applications. The study evaluates the performance of different models and integration strategies, finding that GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform others. However, the results also highlight the importance of the integration strategy in generating effective ontology-compliant knowledge graphs. This approach offers a novel solution to enhance robots' ability to perceive, understand tasks, and execute context-appropriate actions in a platform-independent manner. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic environments, particularly for elderly and individuals requiring assistance. These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks, and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software, resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast, multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data, ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1 and LLaMA 4 Maverick consistently outperform other models. However, our findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results, highlighting the critical role of the integration strategy in generating ontology-compliant KGs.

The article introduces an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for applying stochastic control techniques in modeling interactions between AI systems and multiple agents. It focuses on ensuring fairness and robustness within these systems by incorporating stochastic models of agents' responses. The toolkit allows for the provision of a priori guarantees for the interconnected AI systems, simplifying complex reasoning processes. By utilizing a closed-loop approach, the toolkit addresses fairness and robustness desiderata, offering assurances for the interconnected models. This toolkit streamlines the process of providing fairness guarantees for multi-agent systems, making it more accessible and manageable for practitioners. <div>

With stochastic models of agents' responses to the outputs of AI systems, such {\em a priori\/} guarantees require non-trivial reasoning about the corresponding stochastic systems. Here, we present an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for the use of stochastic control techniques in modelling interconnections of AI systems and properties of their repeated uses. It models robustness and fairness desiderata in a closed-loop fashion, and provides {\em a priori\/} guarantees for these interconnections. The PyTorch-based toolkit removes much of the complexity associated with the provision of fairness guarantees for closed-loop models of multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks like mathematics and programming with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning sequences (slow-thinking), compared with traditional large language models (fast-thinking). However, these reasoning models also face a huge challenge that generating unnecessarily lengthy and redundant reasoning chains even for trivial questions. This phenomenon leads to a significant waste of inference resources, increases the response time for simple queries, and hinders the practical application of LRMs in real-world products. To this end, it is crucial to shorten lengthy reasoning chains and learn adaptive reasoning between fast and slow thinking based on input difficulty. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent progress in concise and adaptive thinking for efficient reasoning of LRMs, including methodologies, benchmarks, and challenges for future exploration. We hope this survey can help researchers quickly understand the landscape of this field and inspire novel adaptive thinking ideas to facilitate better usage of LRMs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, as AI-driven manufacturing becomes increasingly popular, the volume of data streams requiring real-time monitoring continues to grow. However, due to limited resources, it is impractical to place sensors at every location to detect unexpected shifts. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an optimal sensor placement strategy that enables partial observability of the system while detecting anomalies as quickly as possible. Numerous approaches have been proposed to address this challenge; however, most existing methods consider only variable correlations and neglect a crucial factor: Causality. Moreover, although a few techniques incorporate causal analysis, they rely on interventions-artificially creating anomalies-to identify causal effects, which is impractical and might lead to catastrophic losses. In this paper, we introduce a causality-informed deep Q-network (Causal DQ) approach for partially observable sensor placement in anomaly detection. By integrating causal information at each stage of Q-network training, our method achieves faster convergence and tighter theoretical error bounds. Furthermore, the trained causal-informed Q-network significantly reduces the detection time for anomalies under various settings, demonstrating its effectiveness for sensor placement in large-scale, real-world data streams. Beyond the current implementation, our technique's fundamental insights can be applied to various reinforcement learning problems, opening up new possibilities for real-world causality-informed machine learning methods in engineering applications.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in natural language understanding but struggle with logical consistency in their output. This study proposes a method to incorporate an LLM into the formal semantics interpretation function of a paraconsistent logic system. Through experiments with factuality datasets, the method demonstrates the feasibility of integrating LLMs for formal reasoning tasks while maintaining the logic's soundness and completeness. This approach introduces a theoretical framework for neuro-symbolic reasoning that utilizes LLM knowledge effectively. The method offers a solution to leverage the broad-coverage parametric knowledge of LLMs while addressing logical inconsistency issues in output generation. By directly integrating LLMs into formal semantics, this study paves the way for improved reasoning capabilities in natural language processing.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but they exhibit problems with logical consistency in the output they generate. How can we harness LLMs' broad-coverage parametric knowledge in formal reasoning despite their inconsistency? We present a method for directly integrating an LLM into the interpretation function of the formal semantics for a paraconsistent logic. We provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of the method by evaluating the function using datasets created from several short-form factuality benchmarks. Unlike prior work, our method offers a theoretical framework for neuro-symbolic reasoning that leverages an LLM's knowledge while preserving the underlying logic's soundness and completeness properties.

Summary: 
Reasoning-capable language models have shown remarkable performance in complex tasks by generating detailed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. This study investigates whether a base model can acquire long CoT traces with minimal tuning using examples from a stronger reasoning model. Results demonstrate that lightly fine-tuning a base model with a small number of high-quality CoT examples can significantly improve reasoning capabilities. The study also explores using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators but finds that expert CoT traces outperform these alternatives. Key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty and diversity, play a crucial role in distillation. Despite challenges, the study suggests that human-written CoT data, even in small quantities, can stimulate reasoning behaviors in base models. The human-authored dataset generated in this study is made available for further exploration of small-scale reasoning supervision.

Abstract: Reasoning-capable language models achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse complex tasks by generating long, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. While recent works show that base models can acquire such reasoning traces via reinforcement learning or distillation from stronger models like DeepSeek-R1, previous works demonstrate that even short CoT prompting without fine-tuning is able to improve reasoning. We ask whether long CoT can be induced in a base model using only prompting or minimal tuning. Using just 20 long CoT examples from the reasoning model \texttt{QwQ-32B-Preview}, we lightly fine-tune the base model \texttt{Qwen2.5-32B}. The resulting model outperforms the much larger \texttt{Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct}, showing that a handful of high-quality examples can unlock strong reasoning capabilities. We further explore using CoT data from non-reasoning models and human annotators, enhanced with prompt engineering, multi-pass editing, and structural guidance. However, neither matches the performance of reasoning model traces, suggesting that certain latent qualities of expert CoT are difficult to replicate. We analyze key properties of reasoning data, such as problem difficulty, diversity, and answer length, that influence reasoning distillation. While challenges remain, we are optimistic that carefully curated human-written CoT, even in small quantities, can activate reasoning behaviors in base models. We release our human-authored dataset across refinement stages and invite further investigation into what makes small-scale reasoning supervision so effective.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) systems combine neural network and classical symbolic AI mechanisms to exploit the complementary strengths of large scale, generalizable learning and robust, verifiable reasoning. Numerous classifications of neurosymbolic AI illustrate how these two components can be integrated in distinctly different ways. In this work, we propose reinterpreting instruction tuned large language models as model grounded symbolic AI systems where natural language serves as the symbolic layer and grounding is achieved through the models internal representation space. Within this framework, we investigate and develop novel learning and reasoning approaches that preserve structural similarities to traditional learning and reasoning paradigms. Preliminary evaluations across axiomatic deductive reasoning procedures of varying complexity provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach in improving learning efficiency and reasoning reliability.

Summary:<br />
Large language models (LLMs) use reinforcement learning to improve their reasoning abilities, but verifying model-generated responses against reference answers is challenging. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, leading to the use of model-based verifiers. VerifyBench addresses this by creating a benchmark with expert-level questions in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Specialized verifiers have high accuracy but low recall, while general LLMs show better inclusivity but inconsistent precision. The evaluation highlights the trade-offs between different types of verifiers and the limitations in cross-domain generalization. This research provides valuable insights into the challenges in verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, critical for the development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their reasoning capabilities through feedback. A critical challenge is verifying the consistency of model-generated responses and reference answers, since these responses are often lengthy, diverse, and nuanced. Rule-based verifiers struggle with complexity, prompting the use of model-based verifiers. However, specialized verifiers lack flexibility, while general LLM judges can be inconsistent. Existing research primarily focuses on building better verifiers, yet a systematic evaluation of different types of verifiers' performance across domains remains lacking, severely constraining the reliable development of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR). To address this, we propose VerifyBench--a cross-domain comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating verifiers. We construct 4,000 expert-level questions covering mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Each question is equipped with reference answers and diverse responses. The reliability of the evaluation is ensured through a rigorous annotation process conducted by a multidisciplinary expert team. We design a four-dimensional experimental framework to comprehensively compare the performance boundaries of specialized verifiers and general LLMs under combined conditions of extracted answers vs. complete responses, and short vs. long outputs. Our evaluation uncovers fundamental trade-offs in verifiers: while specialized verifiers achieve leading accuracy, they exhibit deficiencies in recall; general models show stronger inclusivity but unstable precision. More importantly, we discover verifiers' high sensitivity to input structure and inherent limitations in cross-domain generalization, providing critical insights into the bottlenecks of current verifier technology.

Summary:
The article addresses the challenge of achieving monotonic improvement in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) by introducing the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG) algorithm. This algorithm resolves the conflict between monotonic improvement and Partial Parameter-sharing (ParPS) by using the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function derived from Q-functions, eliminating sequential policy ratio calculations. The Generalized Q Critic (GQC) is introduced to optimize different Q-value estimations, providing stable baselines for actor updates. Additionally, the Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture is implemented to achieve ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate that OMDPG outperforms existing MARL baselines, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing cooperative performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.09989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS). However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing (ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG) algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$ with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC) as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.

<div> intent intentionality promise theory semantic spacetime process coherence latent intentionality 

Summary: 
The article explores the practical meaning of intent in science and technology, drawing on Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime. By using process coherence as a guide, agents can identify themes and concepts in text without extensive language knowledge. A method is proposed to assess the 'intentionality' in data by detecting anomalies and analyzing the work done to create them, separating intended content from ambient context using spacetime coherence. This approach provides a basic interpretation of latent intentionality at low computational cost, suitable even for simple organisms. The level of concept formation depends on the memory capacity of the agent, suggesting a practical way to understand intentionality without relying on complex reasoning or training processes. <div>
arXiv:2507.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Searle's work deconstructing intent and intentionality in the realm of philosophy, the practical meaning of intent has received little attention in science and technology. Intentionality and context are both central to the scope of Promise Theory's model of Semantic Spacetime, used as an effective Tiny Language Model. One can identify themes and concepts from a text, on a low level (without knowledge of the specific language) by using process coherence as a guide. Any agent process can assess superficially a degree of latent `intentionality' in data by looking for anomalous multi-scale anomalies and assessing the work done to form them. Scale separation can be used to sort parts into `intended' content and `ambient context', using the spacetime coherence as a measure. This offers an elementary but pragmatic interpretation of latent intentionality for very low computational cost, and without reference to extensive training or reasoning capabilities. The process is well within the reach of basic organisms as it does not require large scale artificial probabilistic batch processing. The level of concept formation depends, however, on the memory capacity of the agent.

Abstract: Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning has demonstrated remarkable deep reasoning capabilities in both large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, its reliability is often undermined by the accumulation of errors in intermediate steps. This paper introduces an novel approach to calibrate the CoT reasoning accuracy by leveraging the model's intrinsic veracity encoding. We discover that specific attention head activations reliably reflect the truthfulness of reasoning steps in CoT. Based on this insight, we train a confidence predictor to evaluate the correctness of each reasoning step using these truthfulness-sensitive activations, dynamically selecting the most plausible reasoning path via beam search. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., Few-Shot CoT, Self-Consistency, and Self-Evaluation Guided Beam Search) across the mathematical, symbolic, and commonsense reasoning tasks, exhibiting superior accuracy and reliability in both unimodal and multimodal settings. We further validate the approach on large reasoning models, confirming its applicability to specialized reasoning models. Additionally, we explore the role of the model's self-correction ability in CoT reasoning. This work provides a novel reliability improvement path for CoT reasoning with broad application potential.

Abstract: This paper investigates whether state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) can automatically translate SPARQL between popular Knowledge Graph (KG) schemas. We focus on translations between the DBpedia and Wikidata KG, and later on DBLP and OpenAlex KG. This study addresses a notable gap in KG interoperability research by rigorously evaluating LLM performance on SPARQL-to-SPARQL translation. Two benchmarks are assembled, where the first align 100 DBpedia-Wikidata queries from QALD-9-Plus; the second contains 100 DBLP queries aligned to OpenAlex, testing generalizability beyond encyclopaedic KGs. Three open LLMs: Llama-3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, and Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407 are selected based on their sizes and architectures and tested with zero-shot, few-shot, and two chain-of-thought variants. Outputs were compared with gold answers, and resulting errors were categorized. We find that the performance varies markedly across models and prompting strategies, and that translations for Wikidata to DBpedia work far better than translations for DBpedia to Wikidata.

Summary:
This paper introduces novel gradual semantics for assumption-based argumentation frameworks, offering a fine-grained approach to ascribing dialectical strengths to arguments in structured argumentation. By generalizing existing gradual semantics for quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks, the proposed gradual ABA semantics ensure balance and monotonicity properties. The approach leverages bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of ABA frameworks to derive dialectical strengths for assumptions. Experimental comparisons with a baseline argument-based approach demonstrate the effectiveness and convergence of the proposed gradual ABA semantics in synthetic ABA frameworks. This advancement fills a gap in the research field by extending gradual semantics to assumption-based argumentation, providing valuable insights for various applications of structured argumentation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computational argumentation, gradual semantics are fine-grained alternatives to extension-based and labelling-based semantics . They ascribe a dialectical strength to (components of) arguments sanctioning their degree of acceptability. Several gradual semantics have been studied for abstract, bipolar and quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs), as well as, to a lesser extent, for some forms of structured argumentation. However, this has not been the case for assumption-based argumentation (ABA), despite it being a popular form of structured argumentation with several applications where gradual semantics could be useful. In this paper, we fill this gap and propose a family of novel gradual semantics for equipping assumptions, which are the core components in ABA frameworks, with dialectical strengths. To do so, we use bipolar set-based argumentation frameworks as an abstraction of (potentially non-flat) ABA frameworks and generalise state-of-the-art modular gradual semantics for QBAFs. We show that our gradual ABA semantics satisfy suitable adaptations of desirable properties of gradual QBAF semantics, such as balance and monotonicity. We also explore an argument-based approach that leverages established QBAF modular semantics directly, and use it as baseline. Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic ABA frameworks to compare our gradual ABA semantics with its argument-based counterpart and assess convergence.

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly capable and ubiquitous, ensuring the safety of these systems is critical. However, existing safety tools often target different aspects of model safety and cannot provide full assurance in isolation, highlighting a need for integrated and composite methodologies. This paper introduces BlueGlass, a framework designed to facilitate composite AI safety workflows by providing a unified infrastructure enabling the integration and composition of diverse safety tools that operate across model internals and outputs. Furthermore, to demonstrate the utility of this framework, we present three safety-oriented analyses on vision-language models for the task of object detection: (1) distributional evaluation, revealing performance trade-offs and potential failure modes across distributions; (2) probe-based analysis of layer dynamics highlighting shared hierarchical learning via phase transition; and (3) sparse autoencoders identifying interpretable concepts. More broadly, this work contributes foundational infrastructure and findings for building more robust and reliable AI systems.

<div> Keywords: application migration, edge-cloud system, artificial intelligence, planning, reinforcement learning

Summary: 
In this paper, the focus is on application migration in edge-cloud systems, aiming to achieve high Quality of Service (QoS) and cost-effective service delivery. The approach involves utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to automatically orchestrate migration processes. The research is based on modeling the migration problem as Towers of Hanoi (ToH) problems within a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework. The paper identifies, analyzes, and compares various state-of-the-art AI planning and RL approaches for solving the identified class of problems. A new classification based on the definition of the state space is introduced to enhance the understanding of available techniques for orchestrating application migration in emerging computing continuum environments. This analysis provides insights into the potential of AI and RL methods in addressing complex migration challenges in edge-cloud systems.

Abstract: Application migration in edge-cloud system enables high QoS and cost effective service delivery. However, automatically orchestrating such migration is typically solved with heuristic approaches. Starting from the Markov Decision Process (MDP), in this paper, we identify, analyze and compare selected state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches for solving the class of edge-cloud application migration problems that can be modeled as Towers of Hanoi (ToH) problems. We introduce a new classification based on state space definition and analyze the compared models also through this lense. The aim is to understand available techniques capable of orchestrating such application migration in emerging computing continuum environments.

<div> Keywords: bias, LLMs, debiasing, metacognition, prompt

Summary: 
- The article discusses the ongoing challenge of identifying bias in Language Model Models (LLMs) and the need for general strategies for debiasing that can outlive current models.
- Strategies developed for debiasing human decision-making, particularly through metacognitive prompts, show promise in addressing biases in LLMs.
- The prompt "could you be wrong?" is highlighted as a particularly effective intervention in prompting LLMs to produce additional information, including biases, errors, contradictions, and alternative perspectives.
- The metacognitive prompt helps align the interpretations of LLMs and users, leading to cogent metacognitive reflections and corrections to errors or incomplete information.
- The article argues that leveraging insights from human psychology in prompt engineering can lead to meaningful improvements in addressing biases in LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying bias in LLMs is ongoing. Because they are still in development, what is true today may be false tomorrow. We therefore need general strategies for debiasing that will outlive current models. Strategies developed for debiasing human decision making offer one promising approach as they incorporate an LLM-style prompt intervention designed to bring latent knowledge into awareness during decision making. LLMs trained on vast amounts of information contain information about potential biases, counter-arguments, and contradictory evidence, but that information may only be brought to bear if prompted. Metacognitive prompts developed in the human decision making literature are designed to achieve this, and as I demonstrate here, they show promise with LLMs. The prompt I focus on here is "could you be wrong?" Following an LLM response, this prompt leads LLMs to produce additional information, including why they answered as they did, errors, biases, contradictory evidence, and alternatives, none of which were apparent in their initial response. Indeed, this metaknowledge often reveals that how LLMs and users interpret prompts are not aligned. Here I demonstrate this prompt using a set of questions taken from recent articles about LLM biases, including implicit discriminatory biases and failures of metacognition. "Could you be wrong" prompts the LLM to identify its own biases and produce cogent metacognitive reflection. I also present another example involving convincing but incomplete information, which is readily corrected by the metacognitive prompt. In sum, this work argues that human psychology offers a new avenue for prompt engineering, leveraging a long history of effective prompt-based improvements to human decision making.

<div> Keywords: UAV, wildfire monitoring, Age of Information, deep reinforcement learning, flight resource allocation

Summary:
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in public safety, particularly in wildfire monitoring to detect fires early and minimize environmental damage. This study focuses on optimizing sensor transmission scheduling and velocity in UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems to reduce the Age of Information (AoI) from outdated sensor data. A new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning (FRSICL) is proposed to efficiently optimize the UAV's flight control and data collection schedule in real-time along its trajectory. Unlike Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), FRSICL uses natural language task descriptions and real-time feedback for dynamic decision-making without the need for extensive retraining. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of FRSICL compared to existing baselines like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor methods. The FRSICL approach shows promise for enhancing UAV operations in time-sensitive applications like wildfire monitoring.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.

Summary: 
Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown effectiveness in coordinating multiple agents but faces challenges in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS) due to dynamic environments. The concept of adaptability is introduced to evaluate the reliability of MARL algorithms under shifting conditions. A framework comprising learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven adaptability is proposed. This perspective aims to support more principled assessments of MARL performance beyond benchmarks and develop algorithms suitable for dynamic, real-world MAS deployment. <div>

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown clear effectiveness in coordinating multiple agents across simulated benchmarks and constrained scenarios. However, its deployment in real-world multi-agent systems (MAS) remains limited, primarily due to the complex and dynamic nature of such environments. These challenges arise from multiple interacting sources of variability, including fluctuating agent populations, evolving task goals, and inconsistent execution conditions. Together, these factors demand that MARL algorithms remain effective under continuously changing system configurations and operational demands. To better capture and assess this capacity for adjustment, we introduce the concept of \textit{adaptability} as a unified and practically grounded lens through which to evaluate the reliability of MARL algorithms under shifting conditions, broadly referring to any changes in the environment dynamics that may occur during learning or execution. Centred on the notion of adaptability, we propose a structured framework comprising three key dimensions: learning adaptability, policy adaptability, and scenario-driven adaptability. By adopting this adaptability perspective, we aim to support more principled assessments of MARL performance beyond narrowly defined benchmarks. Ultimately, this survey contributes to the development of algorithms that are better suited for deployment in dynamic, real-world multi-agent systems.

Summary:
AI has made significant advances in nutrition through automatic dietary assessment systems. However, these systems often overlook important factors like ingredient substitutions that affect nutritional content and individual dietary needs. To address this gap in Switzerland, the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG) integrates recipes, ingredients, substitutions, nutrient data, restrictions, and guidelines in one graph. Using a LLM-powered enrichment pipeline, the graph is populated with nutritional information. The SwissFKG provides detailed ingredient-level information, allergen data, and aligns with nutritional guidelines. An application using the graph showcases how LLMs can answer user-specific nutrition queries. Pairing evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the LLM-embedding approach. This work sets the foundation for advanced dietary assessment tools that consider visual, contextual, and cultural aspects of eating.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI has driven significant progress in the nutrition field, especially through multimedia-based automatic dietary assessment. However, existing automatic dietary assessment systems often overlook critical non-visual factors, such as recipe-specific ingredient substitutions that can significantly alter nutritional content, and rarely account for individual dietary needs, including allergies, restrictions, cultural practices, and personal preferences. In Switzerland, while food-related information is available, it remains fragmented, and no centralized repository currently integrates all relevant nutrition-related aspects within a Swiss context. To bridge this divide, we introduce the Swiss Food Knowledge Graph (SwissFKG), the first resource, to our best knowledge, to unite recipes, ingredients, and their substitutions with nutrient data, dietary restrictions, allergen information, and national nutrition guidelines under one graph. We establish a LLM-powered enrichment pipeline for populating the graph, whereby we further present the first benchmark of four off-the-shelf (<70 B parameter) LLMs for food knowledge augmentation. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can effectively enrich the graph with relevant nutritional information. Our SwissFKG goes beyond recipe recommendations by offering ingredient-level information such as allergen and dietary restriction information, and guidance aligned with nutritional guidelines. Moreover, we implement a Graph-RAG application to showcase how the SwissFKG's rich natural-language data structure can help LLM answer user-specific nutrition queries, and we evaluate LLM-embedding pairings by comparing user-query responses against predefined expected answers. As such, our work lays the foundation for the next generation of dietary assessment tools that blend visual, contextual, and cultural dimensions of eating.

<title>Should We Ever Prefer Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning?</title>

<div> Keywords: Transformer architecture, reinforcement learning, offline RL, Decision Transformer, Behavior Cloning

Summary: 
In recent years, the Transformer architecture has been applied to reinforcement learning, with Decision Transformer (DT) gaining attention for its ability to frame return-conditioned policy learning. However, a recent comparison study found that MLP-based Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) outperformed DT in sparse-reward environments on robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks. FBC filters out low-performing trajectories from the training data and then applies ordinary behavior cloning, achieving competitive or superior performance with fewer training data and higher computational efficiency. This challenges the belief that DT is always preferable, suggesting that it may not be the best choice for sparse-reward or dense-reward environments. The results raise the question of when DT is truly preferable in reinforcement learning scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these, Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al. (2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.
  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks (Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments. From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?

Abstract: Research into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for data analysis tasks suffer from a large number of contradictions and lack of concrete design recommendations stemming from gaps in understanding the tasks that require AI assistance. In this paper, we drew on multiple fields such as visual analytics, cognition, and dashboard design to propose a method for categorising and comparing XAI studies under three dimensions: what, why, and who. We identified the main problems as: inadequate descriptions of tasks, context-free studies, and insufficient testing with target users. We propose that studies should specifically report on their users' domain, AI, and data analysis expertise to illustrate the generalisability of their findings. We also propose study guidelines for designing and reporting XAI tasks to improve the XAI community's ability to parse the rapidly growing field. We hope that our contribution can help researchers and designers better identify which studies are most relevant to their work, what gaps exist in the research, and how to handle contradictory results regarding XAI design.

Abstract: Tables are fundamental in domains such as finance, healthcare, and public administration, yet real-world table tasks often involve noise, structural heterogeneity, and semantic complexity--issues underexplored in existing research that primarily targets clean academic datasets. This survey focuses on LLM-based Table Agents, which aim to automate table-centric workflows by integrating preprocessing, reasoning, and domain adaptation. We define five core competencies--C1: Table Structure Understanding, C2: Table and Query Semantic Understanding, C3: Table Retrieval and Compression, C4: Executable Reasoning with Traceability, and C5: Cross-Domain Generalization--to analyze and compare current approaches. In addition, a detailed examination of the Text-to-SQL Agent reveals a performance gap between academic benchmarks and real-world scenarios, especially for open-source models. Finally, we provide actionable insights to improve the robustness, generalization, and efficiency of LLM-based Table Agents in practical settings.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper introduces Instance Space Analysis (ISA) as a new methodology to study the relationship between instance characteristics and metaheuristic performance in the context of the Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). Using data from the DIMACS 12th Implementation Challenge, the authors identified 23 relevant instance characteristics and employed dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods in the PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages. By creating a two-dimensional projection of the instance space, they were able to understand how the structure of instances influences the behavior of metaheuristics. A key contribution of this work is the projection matrix provided, which simplifies the inclusion of new instances for analysis in the CVRP field. This research contributes to advancing CVRP research by providing a new method for analyzing and understanding the intricate relationships between instance characteristics and metaheuristic performance.

Abstract: This paper seeks to advance CVRP research by addressing the challenge of understanding the nuanced relationships between instance characteristics and metaheuristic (MH) performance. We present Instance Space Analysis (ISA) as a valuable tool that allows for a new perspective on the field. By combining the ISA methodology with a dataset from the DIMACS 12th Implementation Challenge on Vehicle Routing, our research enabled the identification of 23 relevant instance characteristics. Our use of the PRELIM, SIFTED, and PILOT stages, which employ dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods, allowed us to create a two-dimensional projection of the instance space to understand how the structure of instances affect the behavior of MHs. A key contribution of our work is that we provide a projection matrix, which makes it straightforward to incorporate new instances into this analysis and allows for a new method for instance analysis in the CVRP field.

Abstract: School dropout is a serious problem in distance learning, where early detection is crucial for effective intervention and student perseverance. Predicting student dropout using available educational data is a widely researched topic in learning analytics. Our partner's distance learning platform highlights the importance of integrating diverse data sources, including socio-demographic data, behavioral data, and sentiment analysis, to accurately predict dropout risks. In this paper, we introduce a novel model that combines sentiment analysis of student comments using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model with socio-demographic and behavioral data analyzed through Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). We fine-tuned BERT on student comments to capture nuanced sentiments, which were then merged with key features selected using feature importance techniques in XGBoost. Our model was tested on unseen data from the next academic year, achieving an accuracy of 84\%, compared to 82\% for the baseline model. Additionally, the model demonstrated superior performance in other metrics, such as precision and F1-score. The proposed method could be a vital tool in developing personalized strategies to reduce dropout rates and encourage student perseverance

This article discusses the importance of transfer learning in adapting neural networks to new tasks when limited data is available in fields such as computational chemistry, immunology, and medical imaging. The study focuses on neural memory to facilitate adaptation on non-stationary distributions with minimal data. Hypernetwork designs, which generate specialized networks, are used to acquire more generalizable priors through Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). The hypernetworks are then applied to 3D scene generation to efficiently learn from a few training scenes, leading to faster text-to-3D generation. Additionally, the framework is extended to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by transferring priors from previously seen scenes. Finally, an existing molecular generative method is repurposed for pre-training to enhance molecular property prediction, addressing challenges in computational immunology.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to transfer knowledge from prior experiences to novel tasks stands as a pivotal capability of intelligent agents, including both humans and computational models. This principle forms the basis of transfer learning, where large pre-trained neural networks are fine-tuned to adapt to downstream tasks. Transfer learning has demonstrated tremendous success, both in terms of task adaptation speed and performance. However there are several domains where, due to lack of data, training such large pre-trained models or foundational models is not a possibility - computational chemistry, computational immunology, and medical imaging are examples. To address these challenges, our work focuses on designing architectures to enable efficient acquisition of priors when large amounts of data are unavailable. In particular, we demonstrate that we can use neural memory to enable adaptation on non-stationary distributions with only a few samples. Then we demonstrate that our hypernetwork designs (a network that generates another network) can acquire more generalizable priors than standard networks when trained with Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Subsequently, we apply hypernetworks to 3D scene generation, demonstrating that they can acquire priors efficiently on just a handful of training scenes, thereby leading to faster text-to-3D generation. We then extend our hypernetwork framework to perform 3D segmentation on novel scenes with limited data by efficiently transferring priors from earlier viewed scenes. Finally, we repurpose an existing molecular generative method as a pre-training framework that facilitates improved molecular property prediction, addressing critical challenges in computational immunology

The method introduces a grid-balanced sampling strategy for generating training sets from sparse labeled datasets and a multi-scale feature fusion module to capture fine features across different land-cover scales. An adaptive hybrid loss module is implemented to balance the learning ability of different classes and improve classification performance, especially for small classes affected by various-scale and long-tailed distributions.

Abstract: Multispectral point cloud (MPC) captures 3D spatial-spectral information from the observed scene, which can be used for scene understanding and has a wide range of applications. However, most of the existing classification methods were extensively tested on indoor datasets, and when applied to outdoor datasets they still face problems including sparse labeled targets, differences in land-covers scales, and long-tailed distributions. To address the above issues, an enhanced classification method based on adaptive multi-scale fusion for MPCs with long-tailed distributions is proposed. In the training set generation stage, a grid-balanced sampling strategy is designed to reliably generate training samples from sparse labeled datasets. In the feature learning stage, a multi-scale feature fusion module is proposed to fuse shallow features of land-covers at different scales, addressing the issue of losing fine features due to scale variations in land-covers. In the classification stage, an adaptive hybrid loss module is devised to utilize multi-classification heads with adaptive weights to balance the learning ability of different classes, improving the classification performance of small classes due to various-scales and long-tailed distributions in land-covers. Experimental results on three MPC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

<div> preference optimization, loss functions, stochastic choice, abstention, non-convex objectives<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper explores the relationship between direct preference optimization (DPO) and two major theories in machine learning: loss functions and stochastic choice. The authors demonstrate that DPO is a specific form of connection between these theories, encompassing all of Savage's losses while also supporting abstention in choice theory and non-convex objectives in ML. This broad perspective allows for the inclusion of extensions to the DPO framework, such as margins and corrections for length, enhancing its applicability to diverse applications. Understanding DPO within this broader theoretical context is crucial given its current popularity and the need to navigate various state-of-the-art variations. By illuminating the general principles behind DPO, the paper offers insight into potential pitfalls and strategies for overcoming them. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we show that direct preference optimization (DPO) is a very specific form of a connection between two major theories in the ML context of learning from preferences: loss functions (Savage) and stochastic choice (Doignon-Falmagne and Machina). The connection is established for all of Savage's losses and at this level of generality, (i) it includes support for abstention on the choice theory side, (ii) it includes support for non-convex objectives on the ML side, and (iii) it allows to frame for free some notable extensions of the DPO setting, including margins and corrections for length. Getting to understand how DPO operates from a general principled perspective is crucial because of the huge and diverse application landscape of models, because of the current momentum around DPO, but also -- and importantly -- because many state of the art variations on DPO definitely occupy a small region of the map that we cover. It also helps to understand the pitfalls of departing from this map, and figure out workarounds.

Abstract: Cloud and cloud shadow masking is a crucial preprocessing step in hyperspectral satellite imaging, enabling the extraction of high-quality, analysis-ready data. This study evaluates various machine learning approaches, including gradient boosting methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM as well as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). All boosting and CNN models achieved accuracies exceeding 93%. Among the investigated models, the CNN with feature reduction emerged as the most efficient, offering a balance of high accuracy, low storage requirements, and rapid inference times on both CPUs and GPUs. Variations of this version, with only up to 597 trainable parameters, demonstrated the best trade-off in terms of deployment feasibility, accuracy, and computational efficiency. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight artificial intelligence (AI) models for real-time hyperspectral image processing, supporting the development of on-board satellite AI systems for space-based applications.

- An automatic method for resilience theory discovery, learning from AI dismantling strategies, has been proposed.
- The method generates a resilience theory considering both topology and dynamics, highlighting the role of node degree and state correlation.
- Formulas discovered by the approach improve existing resilience theories by 37.5%, advancing human understanding of complex networks with AI. <div>

Abstract: Many complex networks display remarkable resilience under external perturbations, internal failures and environmental changes, yet they can swiftly deteriorate into dysfunction upon the removal of a few keystone nodes. Discovering theories that measure network resilience offers the potential to prevent catastrophic collapses--from species extinctions to financial crise--with profound implications for real-world systems. Current resilience theories address the problem from a single perspective of topology, neglecting the crucial role of system dynamics, due to the intrinsic complexity of the coupling between topology and dynamics which exceeds the capabilities of human analytical methods. Here, we report an automatic method for resilience theory discovery, which learns from how AI solves a complicated network dismantling problem and symbolizes its network attack strategies into theoretical formulas. This proposed self-inductive approach discovers the first resilience theory that accounts for both topology and dynamics, highlighting how the correlation between node degree and state shapes overall network resilience, and offering insights for designing early warning signals of systematic collapses. Additionally, our approach discovers formulas that refine existing well-established resilience theories with over 37.5% improvement in accuracy, significantly advancing human understanding of complex networks with AI.

Summary:
Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is used to enhance the reliability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) against bit-flip faults by selectively applying it to critical components. This paper introduces an efficient TMR approach that leverages Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) through Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to determine the importance of individual DNN parameters. By utilizing XAI insights, the method identifies and protects the most critical weights, resulting in a significant reliability improvement of over 60% at a bit error rate of 10-4 for the AlexNet model while maintaining a similar overhead to existing techniques. Experimental evaluations on VGG16 and AlexNet models using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing DNN reliability against bit-flip faults. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely employed in safety-critical domains, where ensuring their reliability is essential. Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) is an effective technique to enhance the reliability of DNNs in the presence of bit-flip faults. In order to handle the significant overhead of TMR, it is applied selectively on the parameters and components with the highest contribution at the model output. Hence, the accuracy of the selection criterion plays the key role on the efficiency of TMR. This paper presents an efficient TMR approach to enhance the reliability of DNNs against bit-flip faults using an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method. Since XAI can provide valuable insights about the importance of individual neurons and weights in the performance of the network, they can be applied as the selection metric in TMR techniques. The proposed method utilizes a low-cost, gradient-based XAI technique known as Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to calculate importance scores for DNN parameters. These scores are then used to enhance the reliability of the model, with the most critical weights being protected by TMR. The proposed approach is evaluated on two DNN models, VGG16 and AlexNet, using datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10. The results demonstrate that the method can protect the AlexNet model at a bit error rate of 10-4, achieving over 60% reliability improvement while maintaining the same overhead as state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: 
The article discusses the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While LoRA reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated and offers advantages in memory consumption and computational efficiency, its speed improvements are inconsistent across different model architectures and training setups. A comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance reveals factors limiting its speedup. The study proposes several methods for more efficient LLM fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations show that these new methods achieve comparable or superior performance and more consistent training speed improvements compared to LoRA. The findings offer valuable insights and practical guidelines for practitioners looking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is one of the most widely used techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). By introducing a small number of trainable low-rank weight matrices, LoRA substantially reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated, offering significant advantages in memory consumption and computational efficiency compared to full fine-tuning. However, we observed that LoRA does not consistently provide speed improvements across all model architectures and training setups. Motivated by this inconsistency, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LoRA's performance and investigate the underlying factors limiting its speedup. Based on our findings, we propose several methods for more efficient fine-tuning of LLMs. We empirically evaluate these methods and compare them to LoRA, demonstrating that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance while delivering more consistent training speed improvements. Our work offers valuable insights and practical guidelines for practitioners seeking to optimize LLM fine-tuning under resource constraints.

<title>Representation learning with a transformer by contrastive learning for money laundering detection</title>

Abstract: The present work tackles the money laundering detection problem. A new procedure is introduced which exploits structured time series of both qualitative and quantitative data by means of a transformer neural network. The first step of this procedure aims at learning representations of time series through contrastive learning (without any labels). The second step leverages these representations to generate a money laundering scoring of all observations. A two-thresholds approach is then introduced, which ensures a controlled false-positive rate by means of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure. Experiments confirm that the transformer is able to produce general representations that succeed in exploiting money laundering patterns with minimal supervision from domain experts. It also illustrates the higher ability of the new procedure for detecting nonfraudsters as well as fraudsters, while keeping the false positive rate under control. This greatly contrasts with rule-based procedures or the ones based on LSTM architectures.

<title>wd1: Weighted Policy Optimization for Reasoning in Diffusion Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The intractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the current, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization step. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to potentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the denominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these issues, we introduce $\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that reformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single approximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on widely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\mathtt{wd1}$, without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL methods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers additional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer function evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with the simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT), position $\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying RL to dLLMs reasoning.

Abstract: Lewy Body Disease (LBD) is a common yet understudied form of dementia that imposes a significant burden on public health. It shares clinical similarities with Alzheimer's disease (AD), as both progress through stages of normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia. A major obstacle in LBD diagnosis is data scarcity, which limits the effectiveness of deep learning. In contrast, AD datasets are more abundant, offering potential for knowledge transfer. However, LBD and AD data are typically collected from different sites using different machines and protocols, resulting in a distinct domain shift. To effectively leverage AD data while mitigating domain shift, we propose a Transferability Aware Transformer (TAT) that adapts knowledge from AD to enhance LBD diagnosis. Our method utilizes structural connectivity (SC) derived from structural MRI as training data. Built on the attention mechanism, TAT adaptively assigns greater weights to disease-transferable features while suppressing domain-specific ones, thereby reducing domain shift and improving diagnostic accuracy with limited LBD data. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TAT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore domain adaptation from AD to LBD under conditions of data scarcity and domain shift, providing a promising framework for domain-adaptive diagnosis of rare diseases.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor). WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at https://github.com/kunjing96/ZSNAS-WRCor.git.

<title>Gradients as an Action: Towards Communication-Efficient Federated Recommender Systems via Adaptive Action Sharing</title>

Abstract: As a promising privacy-aware collaborative model training paradigm, Federated Learning (FL) is becoming popular in the design of distributed recommender systems. However, Federated Recommender Systems (FedRecs) greatly suffer from two major problems: i) extremely high communication overhead due to massive item embeddings involved in recommendation systems, and ii) intolerably low training efficiency caused by the entanglement of both heterogeneous network environments and client devices. Although existing methods attempt to employ various compression techniques to reduce communication overhead, due to the parameter errors introduced by model compression, they inevitably suffer from model performance degradation. To simultaneously address the above problems, this paper presents a communication-efficient FedRec framework named FedRAS, which adopts an action-sharing strategy to cluster the gradients of item embedding into a specific number of model updating actions for communication rather than directly compressing the item embeddings. In this way, the cloud server can use the limited actions from clients to update all the items. Since gradient values are significantly smaller than item embeddings, constraining the directions of gradients (i.e., the action space) introduces smaller errors compared to compressing the entire item embedding matrix into a reduced space. To accommodate heterogeneous devices and network environments, FedRAS incorporates an adaptive clustering mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of actions. Comprehensive experiments on well-known datasets demonstrate that FedRAS can reduce the size of communication payloads by up to 96.88%, while not sacrificing recommendation performance within various heterogeneous scenarios. We have open-sourced FedRAS at https://github.com/mastlab-T3S/FedRAS.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are becoming an essential tool for learning from graph-structured data, however uniform neighbor sampling and static fanout settings frequently limit GNNs' scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Adaptive Fanout Optimization Sampler (DAFOS), a novel approach that dynamically adjusts the fanout based on model performance and prioritizes important nodes during training. Our approach leverages node scoring based on node degree to focus computational resources on structurally important nodes, incrementing the fanout as the model training progresses. DAFOS also integrates an early stopping mechanism to halt training when performance gains diminish. Experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets, ogbnarxiv, Reddit, and ogbn-products, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves training speed and accuracy compared to a state-of-the-art approach. DAFOS achieves a 3.57x speedup on the ogbn-arxiv dataset and a 12.6x speedup on the Reddit dataset while improving the F1 score from 68.5% to 71.21% on ogbn-arxiv and from 73.78% to 76.88% on the ogbn-products dataset, respectively. These results highlight the potential of DAFOS as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale GNN training.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning (ML) has led to its increasing integration into cyber-physical systems (CPS) across diverse domains. While CPS offer powerful capabilities, incorporating ML components introduces significant safety and assurance challenges. Among ML techniques, reinforcement learning (RL) is particularly suited for CPS due to its capacity to handle complex, dynamic environments where explicit models of interaction between system and environment are unavailable or difficult to construct. However, in safety-critical applications, this learning process must not only be effective but demonstrably safe. Safe-RL methods aim to address this by incorporating safety constraints during learning, yet they fall short in providing systematic assurance across the RL lifecycle. The AMLAS methodology offers structured guidance for assuring the safety of supervised learning components, but it does not directly apply to the unique challenges posed by RL. In this paper, we adapt AMLAS to provide a framework for generating assurance arguments for an RL-enabled system through an iterative process; AMLAS-RL. We demonstrate AMLAS-RL using a running example of a wheeled vehicle tasked with reaching a target goal without collision.

Abstract: As archives turn to artificial intelligence to manage growing volumes of digital records, privacy risks inherent in current AI data practices raise critical concerns about data sovereignty and ethical accountability. This paper explores how privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) and Web3 architectures can support archives to preserve control over sensitive content while still being able to make it available for access by researchers. We present Clio-X, a decentralized, privacy-first Web3 digital solution designed to embed PETs into archival workflows and support AI-enabled reference and access. Drawing on a user evaluation of a medium-fidelity prototype, the study reveals both interest in the potential of the solution and significant barriers to adoption related to trust, system opacity, economic concerns, and governance. Using Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation theory, we analyze the sociotechnical dimensions of these barriers and propose a path forward centered on participatory design and decentralized governance through a Clio-X Decentralized Autonomous Organization. By integrating technical safeguards with community-based oversight, Clio-X offers a novel model to ethically deploy AI in cultural heritage contexts.

Abstract: The zero-shot capabilities of foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting offer promising potentials in conformal prediction, as most of the available data can be allocated to calibration. This study compares the performance of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with traditional methods, including statistical models and gradient boosting, within a conformal prediction setting. Our findings highlight two key advantages of TSFMs. First, when the volume of data is limited, TSFMs provide more reliable conformalized prediction intervals than classic models, thanks to their superior predictive accuracy. Second, the calibration process is more stable because more data are used for calibration. Morever, the fewer data available, the more pronounced these benefits become, as classic models require a substantial amount of data for effective training. These results underscore the potential of foundation models in improving conformal prediction reliability in time series applications, particularly in data-constrained cases. All the code to reproduce the experiments is available.

Abstract: Location-based vehicular traffic management faces significant challenges in protecting sensitive geographical data while maintaining utility for traffic management and fairness across regions. Existing state-of-the-art solutions often fail to meet the required level of protection against linkage attacks and demographic biases, leading to privacy leakage and inequity in data analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm designed to address the challenges regarding the balance of privacy, utility, and fairness in location-based vehicular traffic management systems. In this context, utility means providing reliable and meaningful traffic information, while fairness ensures that all regions and individuals are treated equitably in data use and decision-making. Employing differential privacy techniques, we enhance data security by integrating query-based data access with iterative shuffling and calibrated noise injection, ensuring that sensitive geographical data remains protected. We ensure adherence to epsilon-differential privacy standards by implementing the Laplace mechanism. We implemented our algorithm on vehicular location-based data from Norway, demonstrating its ability to maintain data utility for traffic management and urban planning while ensuring fair representation of all geographical areas without being overrepresented or underrepresented. Additionally, we have created a heatmap of Norway based on our model, illustrating the privatized and fair representation of the traffic conditions across various cities. Our algorithm provides privacy in vehicular traffic

Abstract: Travel demand models are critical tools for planning, policy, and mobility system design. Traditional activity-based models (ABMs), although grounded in behavioral theories, often rely on simplified rules and assumptions, and are costly to develop and difficult to adapt across different regions. This paper presents a learning-based travel demand modeling framework that synthesizes household-coordinated daily activity patterns based on a household's socio-demographic profiles. The whole framework integrates population synthesis, coordinated activity generation, location assignment, and large-scale microscopic traffic simulation into a unified system. It is fully generative, data-driven, scalable, and transferable to other regions. A full-pipeline implementation is conducted in Los Angeles with a 10 million population. Comprehensive validation shows that the model closely replicates real-world mobility patterns and matches the performance of legacy ABMs with significantly reduced modeling cost and greater scalability. With respect to the SCAG ABM benchmark, the origin-destination matrix achieves a cosine similarity of 0.97, and the daily vehicle miles traveled (VMT) in the network yields a 0.006 Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) and a 9.8% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). When compared to real-world observations from Caltrans PeMS, the evaluation on corridor-level traffic speed and volume reaches a 0.001 JSD and a 6.11% MAPE.

Abstract: In this paper, a novel contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model based semantic communication framework is designed. Compared to standard neural network (e.g.,convolutional neural network) based semantic encoders and decoders that require joint training over a common dataset, our CLIP model based method does not require any training procedures thus enabling a transmitter to extract data meanings of the original data without neural network model training, and the receiver to train a neural network for follow-up task implementation without the communications with the transmitter. Next, we investigate the deployment of the CLIP model based semantic framework over a noisy wireless network. Since the semantic information generated by the CLIP model is susceptible to wireless noise and the spectrum used for semantic information transmission is limited, it is necessary to jointly optimize CLIP model architecture and spectrum resource block (RB) allocation to maximize semantic communication performance while considering wireless noise, the delay and energy used for semantic communication. To achieve this goal, we use a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to learn how wireless noise affect the semantic communication performance thus finding optimal CLIP model and RB for each user. Simulation results show that our proposed method improves the convergence rate by up to 40%, and the accumulated reward by 4x compared to soft actor-critic.

Abstract: Function Calling is a crucial technique that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external systems through APIs. However, the high latency associated with LLM-based Function Calling significantly impacts user experience. This paper presents a novel approach called Oriented Distillation for Inline Acceleration (ODIA) that leverages online user interaction data to accelerate Function Calling. By automatically identifying "simple queries" from production traffic and distilling knowledge from larger models to smaller ones, our method reduces response latency by 45% (expected) and 78% (median) while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through real-world deployment in a music application, where the smaller model successfully handles 60% of traffic with negligible accuracy loss. Our method requires minimal human intervention and continuously improves through automated data collection and model updating, making it a practical solution for production environments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable generalizability in language comprehension and hold significant potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction in smart homes. Existing LLM-based smart home assistants typically transmit user commands, along with user profiles and home configurations, to remote servers to obtain personalized services. However, users are increasingly concerned about the potential privacy leaks to the remote servers. To address this issue, we develop HomeLLaMA, an on-device assistant for privacy-preserving and personalized smart home serving with a tailored small language model (SLM). HomeLLaMA learns from cloud LLMs to deliver satisfactory responses and enable user-friendly interactions. Once deployed, HomeLLaMA facilitates proactive interactions by continuously updating local SLMs and user profiles. To further enhance user experience while protecting their privacy, we develop PrivShield to offer an optional privacy-preserving LLM-based smart home serving for those users, who are unsatisfied with local responses and willing to send less-sensitive queries to remote servers. For evaluation, we build a comprehensive benchmark DevFinder to assess the service quality. Extensive experiments and user studies (M=100) demonstrate that HomeLLaMA can provide personalized services while significantly enhancing user privacy.

<title>A Multi-Level Strategy for Deepfake Content Moderation under EU Regulation</title>

Abstract: The growing availability and use of deepfake technologies increases risks for democratic societies, e.g., for political communication on online platforms. The EU has responded with transparency obligations for providers and deployers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and online platforms. This includes marking deepfakes during generation and labeling deepfakes when they are shared. However, the lack of industry and enforcement standards poses an ongoing challenge. Through a multivocal literature review, we summarize methods for marking, detecting, and labeling deepfakes and assess their effectiveness under EU regulation. Our results indicate that individual methods fail to meet regulatory and practical requirements. Therefore, we propose a multi-level strategy combining the strengths of existing methods. To account for the masses of content on online platforms, our multi-level strategy provides scalability and practicality via a simple scoring mechanism. At the same time, it is agnostic to types of deepfake technology and allows for context-specific risk weighting.

<title>The Consistency-Acceptability Divergence of LLMs in Judicial Decision-Making: Task and Stakeholder Dimensions</title>

Abstract: The integration of large language model (LLM) technology into judicial systems is fundamentally transforming legal practice worldwide. However, this global transformation has revealed an urgent paradox requiring immediate attention. This study introduces the concept of ``consistency-acceptability divergence'' for the first time, referring to the gap between technical consistency and social acceptance. While LLMs achieve high consistency at the technical level, this consistency demonstrates both positive and negative effects. Through comprehensive analysis of recent data on LLM judicial applications from 2023--2025, this study finds that addressing this challenge requires understanding both task and stakeholder dimensions. This study proposes the Dual-Track Deliberative Multi-Role LLM Judicial Governance Framework (DTDMR-LJGF), which enables intelligent task classification and meaningful interaction among diverse stakeholders. This framework offers both theoretical insights and practical guidance for building an LLM judicial ecosystem that balances technical efficiency with social legitimacy.

Abstract: How to enable robots to predict the outcomes of their own motion intentions in three-dimensional space has been a fundamental problem in embodied intelligence. To explore more general spatial imagination capabilities, here we present AirScape, the first world model designed for six-degree-of-freedom aerial agents. AirScape predicts future observation sequences based on current visual inputs and motion intentions. Specifically, we construct an dataset for aerial world model training and testing, which consists of 11k video-intention pairs. This dataset includes first-person-view videos capturing diverse drone actions across a wide range of scenarios, with over 1,000 hours spent annotating the corresponding motion intentions. Then we develop a two-phase training schedule to train a foundation model -- initially devoid of embodied spatial knowledge -- into a world model that is controllable by motion intentions and adheres to physical spatio-temporal constraints.

Abstract: This is the fifth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set, based on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with passage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using labels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO queries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike the test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more difficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO (human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a fine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.
  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model (LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the "nnlm" approach, which was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last year of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in other tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not just human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar results to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\tau=0.8487$. However, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries that were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4 were favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using T5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.

<title>SEALGuard: Safeguarding the Multilingual Conversations in Southeast Asian Languages for LLM Software Systems</title>

Abstract: Safety alignment is critical for LLM-powered systems. While recent LLM-powered guardrail approaches such as LlamaGuard achieve high detection accuracy of unsafe inputs written in English (e.g., ``How to create a bomb?''), they struggle with multilingual unsafe inputs. This limitation leaves LLM systems vulnerable to unsafe and jailbreak prompts written in low-resource languages such as those in Southeast Asia. This paper introduces SEALGuard, a multilingual guardrail designed to improve the safety alignment across diverse languages. It aims to address the multilingual safety alignment gap of existing guardrails and ensure effective filtering of unsafe and jailbreak prompts in LLM-powered systems. We adapt a general-purpose multilingual language model into a multilingual guardrail using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). We construct SEALSBench, a large-scale multilingual safety alignment dataset containing over 260,000 prompts in ten languages, including safe, unsafe, and jailbreak cases. We evaluate SEALGuard against state-of-the-art guardrails such as LlamaGuard on this benchmark. Our findings show that multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts substantially degrade the performance of the state-of-the-art LlamaGuard, which experiences a drop in Defense Success Rate (DSR) by 9% and 18%, respectively, compared to its performance on English-only prompts. In contrast, SEALGuard outperforms existing guardrails in detecting multilingual unsafe and jailbreak prompts, improving DSR by 48% over LlamaGuard and achieving the best DSR, precision, and F1-score. Our ablation study further reveals the contributions of adaptation strategies and model size to the overall performance of SEALGuard. SEALGuard advances the safety alignment of LLM systems by introducing an effective multilingual guardrail.

Abstract: Personalized vaccines and T-cell immunotherapies depend critically on identifying peptide-MHC class I (pMHC-I) interactions capable of eliciting potent immune responses. However, current benchmarks and models inherit biases present in mass-spectrometry and binding-assay datasets, limiting discovery of novel peptide ligands. To address this issue, we introduce a structure-guided benchmark of pMHC-I peptides designed using diffusion models conditioned on crystal structure interaction distances. Spanning twenty high-priority HLA alleles, this benchmark is independent of previously characterized peptides yet reproduces canonical anchor residue preferences, indicating structural generalization without experimental dataset bias. Using this resource, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art sequence-based predictors perform poorly at recognizing the binding potential of these structurally stable designs, indicating allele-specific limitations invisible in conventional evaluations. Our geometry-aware design pipeline yields peptides with high predicted structural integrity and higher residue diversity than existing datasets, representing a key resource for unbiased model training and evaluation. Our code, and data are available at: https://github.com/sermare/struct-mhc-dev.

<title>Last Layer Hamiltonian Monte Carlo</title>

Abstract: We explore the use of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling as a probabilistic last layer approach for deep neural networks (DNNs). While HMC is widely regarded as a gold standard for uncertainty estimation, the computational demands limit its application to large-scale datasets and large DNN architectures. Although the predictions from the sampled DNN parameters can be parallelized, the computational cost still scales linearly with the number of samples (similar to an ensemble). Last layer HMC (LL--HMC) reduces the required computations by restricting the HMC sampling to the final layer of a DNN, making it applicable to more data-intensive scenarios with limited computational resources. In this paper, we compare LL-HMC against five last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods across three real-world video datasets for driver action and intention. We evaluate the in-distribution classification performance, calibration, and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. Due to the stochastic nature of the probabilistic evaluations, we performed five grid searches for different random seeds to avoid being reliant on a single initialization for the hyperparameter configurations. The results show that LL--HMC achieves competitive in-distribution classification and OOD detection performance. Additional sampled last layer parameters do not improve the classification performance, but can improve the OOD detection. Multiple chains or starting positions did not yield consistent improvements.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence-generated content has become increasingly popular, yet its malicious use, particularly the deepfakes, poses a serious threat to public trust and discourse. While deepfake detection methods achieve high predictive performance, they often exhibit biases across demographic attributes such as ethnicity and gender. In this work, we tackle the challenge of fair deepfake detection, aiming to mitigate these biases while maintaining robust detection capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel post-processing approach, referred to as Fairness-Oriented Final Layer Input Prioritising (Fair-FLIP), that reweights a trained model's final-layer inputs to reduce subgroup disparities, prioritising those with low variability while demoting highly variable ones. Experimental results comparing Fair-FLIP to both the baseline (without fairness-oriented de-biasing) and state-of-the-art approaches show that Fair-FLIP can enhance fairness metrics by up to 30% while maintaining baseline accuracy, with only a negligible reduction of 0.25%.

Abstract: We introduce AMix-1, a powerful protein foundation model built on Bayesian Flow Networks and empowered by a systematic training methodology, encompassing pretraining scaling laws, emergent capability analysis, in-context learning mechanism, and test-time scaling algorithm. To guarantee robust scalability, we establish a predictive scaling law and reveal the progressive emergence of structural understanding via loss perspective, culminating in a strong 1.7-billion model. Building on this foundation, we devise a multiple sequence alignment (MSA)-based in-context learning strategy to unify protein design into a general framework, where AMix-1 recognizes deep evolutionary signals among MSAs and consistently generates structurally and functionally coherent proteins. This framework enables the successful design of a dramatically improved AmeR variant with an up to $50\times$ activity increase over its wild type. Pushing the boundaries of protein engineering, we further empower AMix-1 with an evolutionary test-time scaling algorithm for in silico directed evolution that delivers substantial, scalable performance gains as verification budgets are intensified, laying the groundwork for next-generation lab-in-the-loop protein design.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable promise for tackling complex tasks by breaking them down into subtasks that are iteratively planned, executed, observed, and refined. Despite their effectiveness, these systems often incur high latency because real-world problems frequently demand multiple iterative cycles of reasoning steps. To address this challenge, we propose M1-Parallel, a framework that concurrently runs multiple multi-agent teams in parallel to uncover distinct solution paths. By leveraging an event-driven communication model with asynchronous messaging, M1-Parallel efficiently capitalizes on the inherent diversity of valid plans to either reduce end-to-end latency or boost task completion rates. Our experiments on complex tasks show that M1-Parallel with early termination achieves up to $2.2\times$ speedup while preserving accuracy, and that M1-Parallel with aggregation yields higher task completion rates. We further investigate strategies aimed at encouraging diverse execution plans but observe no additional performance gains over repeated sampling. Overall, these findings underscore the potential of parallel plan execution for optimizing multi-agent systems for real-world, high-complexity reasoning tasks.

<title>GraphRunner: A Multi-Stage Framework for Efficient and Accurate Graph-Based Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches are common in text-based applications. However, they struggle with structured, interconnected datasets like knowledge graphs, where understanding underlying relationships is crucial for accurate retrieval. A common direction in graph-based retrieval employs iterative, rule-based traversal guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Such existing iterative methods typically combine reasoning with single hop traversal at each step, making them vulnerable to LLM reasoning errors and hallucinations that ultimately hinder the retrieval of relevant information.
  To address these limitations, we propose GraphRunner, a novel graph-based retrieval framework that operates in three distinct stages: planning, verification, and execution. This introduces high-level traversal actions that enable multi-hop exploration in a single step. It also generates a holistic traversal plan, which is verified against the graph structure and pre-defined traversal actions, reducing reasoning errors and detecting hallucinations before execution. GraphRunner significantly reduces LLM reasoning errors and detects hallucinations through validation. Our evaluation using the GRBench dataset shows that GraphRunner consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving 10-50% performance improvements over the strongest baseline while reducing inference cost by 3.0-12.9x and response generation time by 2.5-7.1x, making it significantly more robust and efficient for graph-based retrieval tasks.

Abstract: As cosmological simulations and their associated software become increasingly complex, physicists face the challenge of searching through vast amounts of literature and user manuals to extract simulation parameters from dense academic papers, each using different models and formats. Translating these parameters into executable scripts remains a time-consuming and error-prone process. To improve efficiency in physics research and accelerate the cosmological simulation process, we introduce SimAgents, a multi-agent system designed to automate both parameter configuration from the literature and preliminary analysis for cosmology research. SimAgents is powered by specialized LLM agents capable of physics reasoning, simulation software validation, and tool execution. These agents collaborate through structured communication, ensuring that extracted parameters are physically meaningful, internally consistent, and software-compliant. We also construct a cosmological parameter extraction evaluation dataset by collecting over 40 simulations in published papers from Arxiv and leading journals that cover diverse simulation types. Experiments on the dataset demonstrate a strong performance of SimAgents, highlighting its effectiveness and potential to accelerate scientific research for physicists. Our demonstration video is available at: https://youtu.be/w1zLpm_CaWA. The complete system and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/xwzhang98/SimAgents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance on a wide range of complex reasoning tasks, yet further gains are often possible by leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple models. While multi-agent frameworks can improve solution quality by leveraging multiple LLMs, existing methods are often computationally expensive, both at training and inference time. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical multi-agent framework that addresses these challenges by training only a single leader LLM to coordinate a team of untrained peer agents. To this end, we propose Multi-agent guided Leader Policy \textbf{O}ptimization (MLPO), a novel approach which trains the leader to evaluate and synthesize agent responses without auxiliary value networks or explicit agent feedback. Leaders trained with MLPO exhibit improved performance not only when interacting with the agent team at inference time, but also enjoy improved performance when deployed in single-agent settings without the team. Empirical results on Big-Bench Hard (BBH), MATH, and MMLU demonstrate that our framework achieves substantial performance improvements over both single-agent and multi-agent baselines. Our results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of training a single, flexible leader for collaborative reasoning in multi-agent LLM systems.

<title>Theory-Informed Improvements to Classifier-Free Guidance for Discrete Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for conditional generation and improving sample quality in continuous diffusion models, and recent works have extended it to discrete diffusion. This paper theoretically analyzes CFG in the context of masked discrete diffusion, focusing on the role of guidance schedules. Our analysis shows that high guidance early in sampling (when inputs are heavily masked) harms generation quality, while late-stage guidance has a larger effect. These findings provide a theoretical explanation for empirical observations in recent studies on guidance schedules. The analysis also reveals an imperfection of the current CFG implementations. These implementations can unintentionally cause imbalanced transitions, such as unmasking too rapidly during the early stages of generation, which degrades the quality of the resulting samples. To address this, we draw insight from the analysis and propose a novel classifier-free guidance mechanism empirically applicable to any discrete diffusion. Intuitively, our method smoothens the transport between the data distribution and the initial (masked/uniform) distribution, which results in improved sample quality. Remarkably, our method is achievable via a simple one-line code change. The efficacy of our method is empirically demonstrated with experiments on ImageNet (masked discrete diffusion) and QM9 (uniform discrete diffusion).

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction is essential for drug discovery and toxicity assessment. While machine learning (ML) promises fast and accurate predictions, its progress is constrained by the availability of reliable data. In contrast, physics-based methods such as absolute binding free energy perturbation (AB-FEP) deliver high accuracy but are computationally prohibitive for high-throughput applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToxBench, the first large-scale AB-FEP dataset designed for ML development and focused on a single pharmaceutically critical target, Human Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ER$\alpha$). ToxBench contains 8,770 ER$\alpha$-ligand complex structures with binding free energies computed via AB-FEP with a subset validated against experimental affinities at 1.75 kcal/mol RMSE, along with non-overlapping ligand splits to assess model generalizability. Using ToxBench, we further benchmark state-of-the-art ML methods, and notably, our proposed DualBind model, which employs a dual-loss framework to effectively learn the binding energy function. The benchmark results demonstrate the superior performance of DualBind and the potential of ML to approximate AB-FEP at a fraction of the computational cost.

Abstract: Turbulent fluid flows are among the most computationally demanding problems in science, requiring enormous computational resources that become prohibitive at high flow speeds. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a radically different approach that trains neural networks directly from physical equations rather than data, offering the potential for continuous, mesh-free solutions. Here we show that appropriately designed PINNs can successfully simulate fully turbulent flows in both two and three dimensions, directly learning solutions to the fundamental fluid equations without traditional computational grids or training data. Our approach combines several algorithmic innovations including adaptive network architectures, causal training, and advanced optimization methods to overcome the inherent challenges of learning chaotic dynamics. Through rigorous validation on challenging turbulence problems, we demonstrate that PINNs accurately reproduce key flow statistics including energy spectra, kinetic energy, enstrophy, and Reynolds stresses. Our results demonstrate that neural equation solvers can handle complex chaotic systems, opening new possibilities for continuous turbulence modeling that transcends traditional computational limitations.

Abstract: Scientific modeling faces a core limitation: mechanistic models offer interpretability but collapse under real-world complexity, while machine learning models are flexible but require large labeled datasets, cannot infer unobservable quantities, and operate as black boxes. We introduce Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs), a general framework that uses mechanistic simulations as training data for neural networks. SGNNs are pretrained on synthetic corpora spanning diverse model structures, parameter regimes, stochasticity, and observational artifacts. We evaluated SGNNs across scientific disciplines and modeling tasks, and found that SGNNs achieved state-of-the-art results across settings: for prediction tasks, they nearly tripled COVID-19 forecasting skill versus CDC baselines, reduced chemical yield prediction error by one third, and maintained accuracy in ecological forecasting where task specific models failed. For inference tasks, SGNNs also accurately classified the source of information spread in simulated social networks and enabled supervised learning for unobservable targets, such as estimating COVID-19 transmissibility more accurately than traditional methods even in early outbreaks. Finally, SGNNs enable back-to-simulation attribution, a new form of mechanistic interpretability. Given real world input, SGNNs retrieve simulations based on what the model has learned to see as most similar, revealing which underlying dynamics the model believes are active. This provides process-level insight -- what the model thinks is happening -- not just which features mattered. SGNNs unify scientific theory with deep learning flexibility and unlock a new modeling paradigm -- transforming simulations from rigid, post hoc tools into flexible sources of supervision, enabling robust, interpretable inference even when ground truth is missing.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA. The code is available at https://github.com/ChenyuWang-Monica/REED.

Abstract: Methods: We developed a self-supervised deep learning model that extracts meaningful patterns from multi-modal signals (Electroencephalography (EEG), Electrocardiography (ECG), and respiratory signals). The model was trained on data from 4,398 participants. Projection scores were derived by contrasting embeddings from individuals with and without CVD outcomes. External validation was conducted in an independent cohort with 1,093 participants. The source code is available on https://github.com/miraclehetech/sleep-ssl. Results: The projection scores revealed distinct and clinically meaningful patterns across modalities. ECG-derived features were predictive of both prevalent and incident cardiac conditions, particularly CVD mortality. EEG-derived features were predictive of incident hypertension and CVD mortality. Respiratory signals added complementary predictive value. Combining these projection scores with the Framingham Risk Score consistently improved predictive performance, achieving area under the curve values ranging from 0.607 to 0.965 across different outcomes. Findings were robustly replicated and validated in the external testing cohort. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate individualized CVD risk scores directly from PSG data. The resulting projection scores have the potential to be integrated into clinical practice, enhancing risk assessment and supporting personalized care.

<title>Hybrid Systolic Array Accelerator with Optimized Dataflow for Edge Large Language Model Inference</title>

Abstract: Edge inference for large language models (LLM) offers secure, low-latency, and cost-effective inference solutions. We emphasize that an edge accelerator should achieve high area efficiency and minimize external memory access (EMA) during the memory-bound decode stage, while maintaining high energy efficiency during the compute intensive prefill stage. This paper proposes an edge LLM inference accelerator featuring a hybrid systolic array (HSA) architecture that optimizes inference efficiency in both stages. To further reduce EMA, we adopt MXINT4 weight quantization and propose an optimized dataflow tailored for HSA, ensuring negligible dequantization overhead and achieving 100% hardware utilization with minimal accuracy loss under edge DRAM bandwidth constraints. For non-linear operations, we incorporate optimized root mean square normalization (RMSNorm) and rotary position embedding (RoPE) units, reducing their latency, area, and memory access overhead while enabling end-to-end inference on our accelerator. Our solution achieves 247/117 (token/s/mm2) while running a 1.3B LLM on long-input/long-output scenarios, providing >2.45x/13.5x improvement over existing approaches, while maintaining superior energy efficiency in token generation.

<title>On Evaluating Performance of LLM Inference Serving Systems</title>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM) inference systems has yielded significant efficiency improvements. However, our systematic analysis reveals that current evaluation methodologies frequently exhibit fundamental flaws, often manifesting as common evaluation anti-patterns that obscure true performance characteristics and impede scientific progress. Through a comprehensive examination of recent systems, we identify recurring anti-patterns across three key dimensions: Baseline Fairness, Evaluation Setup, and Metric Design. These anti-patterns are uniquely problematic for LLM inference due to its dual-phase nature combining distinct prefill and decode operations, its handling of highly heterogeneous workloads, and its strict temporal requirements for interactive use. We demonstrate how common anti-patterns -- such as inadequate baseline comparisons that conflate engineering effort with algorithmic novelty, workload selections that fail to represent production scenarios, and metric normalizations that hide substantial performance variability like generation stalls-lead to misleading conclusions. To address these challenges, we provide a comprehensive checklist derived from our analysis, establishing a framework for recognizing and avoiding these anti-patterns in favor of robust LLM inference evaluation. To demonstrate the practical application of our framework, we present a case study analyzing speculative decoding, a technique whose bursty, non-uniform token generation is easily misinterpreted when evaluated using approaches characteristic of these anti-patterns. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for evaluation methodology, enabling meaningful comparisons, ensuring reproducible results, and ultimately accelerating genuine progress in LLM inference systems by moving beyond common anti-patterns to align evaluation with real-world requirements.

Abstract: The pharmaceutical industry faces unprecedented challenges in drug discovery, with traditional approaches struggling to meet modern therapeutic development demands. This paper introduces a novel AI framework, Tippy, that transforms laboratory automation through specialized AI agents operating within the Design-Make-Test-Analyze (DMTA) cycle. Our multi-agent system employs five specialized agents - Supervisor, Molecule, Lab, Analysis, and Report, with Safety Guardrail oversight - each designed to excel in specific phases of the drug discovery pipeline. Tippy represents the first production-ready implementation of specialized AI agents for automating the DMTA cycle, providing a concrete example of how AI can transform laboratory workflows. By leveraging autonomous AI agents that reason, plan, and collaborate, we demonstrate how Tippy accelerates DMTA cycles while maintaining scientific rigor essential for pharmaceutical research. The system shows significant improvements in workflow efficiency, decision-making speed, and cross-disciplinary coordination, offering a new paradigm for AI-assisted drug discovery.

Abstract: Cancer research is increasingly driven by the integration of diverse data modalities, spanning from genomics and proteomics to imaging and clinical factors. However, extracting actionable insights from these vast and heterogeneous datasets remains a key challenge. The rise of foundation models (FMs) -- large deep-learning models pretrained on extensive amounts of data serving as a backbone for a wide range of downstream tasks -- offers new avenues for discovering biomarkers, improving diagnosis, and personalizing treatment. This paper presents a comprehensive review of widely adopted integration strategies of multimodal data to assist advance the computational approaches for data-driven discoveries in oncology. We examine emerging trends in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), including methodological frameworks, validation protocols, and open-source resources targeting cancer subtype classification, biomarker discovery, treatment guidance, and outcome prediction. This study also comprehensively covers the shift from traditional ML to FMs for multimodal integration. We present a holistic view of recent FMs advancements and challenges faced during the integration of multi-omics with advanced imaging data. We identify the state-of-the-art FMs, publicly available multi-modal repositories, and advanced tools and methods for data integration. We argue that current state-of-the-art integrative methods provide the essential groundwork for developing the next generation of large-scale, pre-trained models poised to further revolutionize oncology. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review to systematically map the transition from conventional ML to advanced FM for multimodal data integration in oncology, while also framing these developments as foundational for the forthcoming era of large-scale AI models in cancer research.

Abstract: Distributed pre-training of large models at scale often imposes heavy memory demands on individual nodes and incurs significant intra-node communication costs. We propose a novel alternative approach that reduces the memory requirements by training small, structured subnetworks of the model on separate workers. Unlike pipelining, our method avoids inter-node activation communication and maintains bandwidth requirements that are comparable to or lower than standard data parallel communication schemes based on all-reduce. We evaluate two subnetwork construction strategies guided by the principle of ensuring uniform representation of each parameter across the distributed training setup. Our results show that the stochastic block dropping technique consistently outperforms the width-wise subnetwork construction previously explored in federated learning. We empirically attribute this superior performance to stronger gradient alignment in subnetworks that retain blocks having skip connections. Preliminary experiments highlight the promise of our approach, achieving a 20-40% reduction in memory usage without any loss in performance.

Abstract: BrainLesion Suite is a versatile toolkit for building modular brain lesion image analysis pipelines in Python. Following Pythonic principles, BrainLesion Suite is designed to provide a 'brainless' development experience, minimizing cognitive effort and streamlining the creation of complex workflows for clinical and scientific practice. At its core is an adaptable preprocessing module that performs co-registration, atlas registration, and optional skull-stripping and defacing on arbitrary multi-modal input images. BrainLesion Suite leverages algorithms from the BraTS challenge to synthesize missing modalities, inpaint lesions, and generate pathology-specific tumor segmentations. BrainLesion Suite also enables quantifying segmentation model performance, with tools such as panoptica to compute lesion-wise metrics. Although BrainLesion Suite was originally developed for image analysis pipelines of brain lesions such as glioma, metastasis, and multiple sclerosis, it can be adapted for other biomedical image analysis applications. The individual BrainLesion Suite packages and tutorials are accessible on GitHub.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as decision aids. However, users have diverse values and preferences that can affect their decision-making, which requires novel methods for LLM alignment and personalization. Existing LLM comparison tools largely focus on benchmarking tasks, such as knowledge-based question answering. In contrast, our proposed ALIGN system focuses on dynamic personalization of LLM-based decision-makers through prompt-based alignment to a set of fine-grained attributes. Key features of our system include robust configuration management, structured output generation with reasoning, and several algorithm implementations with swappable LLM backbones, enabling different types of analyses. Our user interface enables a qualitative, side-by-side comparison of LLMs and their alignment to various attributes, with a modular backend for easy algorithm integration. Additionally, we perform a quantitative analysis comparing alignment approaches in two different domains: demographic alignment for public opinion surveys and value alignment for medical triage decision-making. The entire ALIGN framework is open source and will enable new research on reliable, responsible, and personalized LLM-based decision-makers.

Abstract: Modern Large Language Model (LLM) agents promise end to end assistance with real-world software tasks, yet existing benchmarks evaluate LLM agents almost exclusively in pre-baked environments where every dependency is pre-installed. To fill this gap, we introduce SetupBench, a 93 instance benchmark that isolates the environment-bootstrap skill: starting from a bare Linux sandbox, an agent must install packages, resolve dependency conflicts, initialize databases, and configure background services. Our tasks span seven language ecosystems, five database engines, and multi-service orchestration scenarios, each accompanies by a natural language problem statement and a deterministic success command. Through evaluation of OpenHands, a state-of-the-art coding agent, we find low success rates across task categories, with particular challenges in repository setup (38.9-57.4%) and local database configuration (20.0-53.3%). Our analysis reveals systematic failure modes including incomplete development tooling installation, hallucinated task constraints, and non-persistent environment modifications that break agent-human collaboration workflows. We identify substantial inefficiencies in agent exploration strategies, with 38-89% of actions being unnecessary compared to optimal human behavior. These findings highlight gaps in current agents' practical environment-bootstrap capabilities. By targeting this critical yet under-evaluated capability, SetupBench provides a rigorous yard-stick for the next generation of software developer agents aiming to solve end to end real-wold tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions (MLLMs) have ushered in remarkable progress in video understanding. However, a fundamental challenge persists: effectively processing and comprehending video content that extends beyond minutes or hours. While recent efforts like Video-XL-2 have demonstrated novel architectural solutions for extreme efficiency, and advancements in positional encoding such as HoPE and VideoRoPE++ aim to improve spatio-temporal understanding over extensive contexts, current state-of-the-art models still encounter significant computational and memory constraints when faced with the sheer volume of visual tokens from lengthy sequences. Furthermore, maintaining temporal coherence, tracking complex events, and preserving fine-grained details over extended periods remain formidable hurdles, despite progress in agentic reasoning systems like Deep Video Discovery. This position paper posits that a logical, albeit ambitious, next frontier for multimedia research is Infinite Video Understanding -- the capability for models to continuously process, understand, and reason about video data of arbitrary, potentially never-ending duration. We argue that framing Infinite Video Understanding as a blue-sky research objective provides a vital north star for the multimedia, and the wider AI, research communities, driving innovation in areas such as streaming architectures, persistent memory mechanisms, hierarchical and adaptive representations, event-centric reasoning, and novel evaluation paradigms. Drawing inspiration from recent work on long/ultra-long video understanding and several closely related fields, we outline the core challenges and key research directions towards achieving this transformative capability.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to improve speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame rate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding capabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only process 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its capacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the continuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This paper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual semantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of unlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM progressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary LoRA module during inference to effectively "memorize" the contextual information. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM into inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC). Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset show that DPM significantly improves the emotion recognition capabilities of SLLM when processing long audio sequences, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of simulated AI agents (large language models, or LLMs) in auctions, introducing a novel synthetic data-generating process to help facilitate the study and design of auctions. We find that LLMs -- when endowed with chain of thought reasoning capacity -- agree with the experimental literature in auctions across a variety of classic auction formats. In particular, we find that LLM bidders produce results consistent with risk-averse human bidders; that they perform closer to theoretical predictions in obviously strategy-proof auctions; and, that they succumb to the winner's curse in common value settings. On prompting, we find that LLMs are not very sensitive to naive changes in prompts (e.g., language, currency) but can improve dramatically towards theoretical predictions with the right mental model (i.e., the language of Nash deviations). We run 1,000$+$ auctions for less than $\$$400 with GPT-4 models (three orders of magnitude cheaper than modern auction experiments) and develop a framework flexible enough to run auction experiments with any LLM model and a wide range of auction design specifications, facilitating further experimental study by decreasing costs and serving as a proof-of-concept for the use of LLM proxies.

Abstract: Flight delays are a significant challenge in the aviation industry, causing major financial and operational disruptions. To improve passenger experience and reduce revenue loss, flight delay prediction models must be both precise and generalizable across different networks. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines Queue-Theory with a simple attention model, referred to as the Queue-Theory SimAM (QT-SimAM). To validate our model, we used data from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, where our proposed QT-SimAM (Bidirectional) model outperformed existing methods with an accuracy of 0.927 and an F1 score of 0.932. To assess transferability, we tested the model on the EUROCONTROL dataset. The results demonstrated strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.826 and an F1 score of 0.791. Ultimately, this paper outlines an effective, end-to-end methodology for predicting flight delays. The proposed model's ability to forecast delays with high accuracy across different networks can help reduce passenger anxiety and improve operational decision-making

Abstract: Achieving fast and stable off-policy learning in deep reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging. Most existing methods rely on semi-gradient temporal-difference (TD) methods for their simplicity and efficiency, but are consequently susceptible to divergence. While more principled approaches like Gradient TD (GTD) methods have strong convergence guarantees, they have rarely been used in deep RL. Recent work introduced the Generalized Projected Bellman Error ($\GPBE$), enabling GTD methods to work efficiently with nonlinear function approximation. However, this work is only limited to one-step methods, which are slow at credit assignment and require a large number of samples. In this paper, we extend the $\GPBE$ objective to support multistep credit assignment based on the $\lambda$-return and derive three gradient-based methods that optimize this new objective. We provide both a forward-view formulation compatible with experience replay and a backward-view formulation compatible with streaming algorithms. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithms and show that they outperform both PPO and StreamQ in MuJoCo and MinAtar environments, respectively.

Abstract: In decision-making conversations, experts must navigate complex choices and make on-the-spot decisions while engaged in conversation. Although extensive historical data often exists, the real-time nature of these scenarios makes it infeasible for decision-makers to review and leverage relevant information. This raises an interesting question: What if experts could utilize relevant past data in real-time decision-making through insights derived from past data? To explore this, we implemented a conversational user interface, taking doctor-patient interactions as an example use case. Our system continuously listens to the conversation, identifies patient problems and doctor-suggested solutions, and retrieves related data from an embedded dataset, generating concise insights using a pipeline built around a retrieval-based Large Language Model (LLM) agent. We evaluated the prototype by embedding Health Canada datasets into a vector database and conducting simulated studies using sample doctor-patient dialogues, showing effectiveness but also challenges, setting directions for the next steps of our work.

Abstract: Recently, the role of LLM-as-judge in evaluating large language models has gained prominence. However, current judge models suffer from narrow specialization and limited robustness, undermining their capacity for comprehensive evaluations. In this work, we present CompassJudger-2, a novel generalist judge model that overcomes these limitations via a task-driven, multi-domain data curation strategy. Central to our approach is supervising judgment tasks with verifiable rewards, guiding intrinsic critical reasoning through rejection sampling to foster robust, generalizable judgment capabilities. We introduce a refined learning objective with margin policy gradient loss to enhance performance. Empirically, CompassJudger-2 achieves superior results across multiple judge and reward benchmarks, and our 7B model demonstrates competitive judgment accuracy with significantly larger models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B. Additionally, we propose JudgerBenchV2, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating cross-domain judgment accuracy and rank consistency to standardize judge model evaluation. These contributions advance robust, scalable LLM judgment and establish new performance and evaluation standards.

Abstract: High-quality labeled datasets are crucial for training and evaluating foundation models in software engineering, but creating them is often prohibitively expensive and labor-intensive. We introduce SPICE, a scalable, automated pipeline for labeling SWE-bench-style datasets with annotations for issue clarity, test coverage, and effort estimation. SPICE combines context-aware code navigation, rationale-driven prompting, and multi-pass consensus to produce labels that closely approximate expert annotations. SPICE's design was informed by our own experience and frustration in labeling more than 800 instances from SWE-Gym. SPICE achieves strong agreement with human-labeled SWE-bench Verified data while reducing the cost of labeling 1,000 instances from around $100,000 (manual annotation) to just $5.10. These results demonstrate SPICE's potential to enable cost-effective, large-scale dataset creation for SE-focused FMs. To support the community, we release both SPICE tool and SPICE Bench, a new dataset of 6,802 SPICE-labeled instances curated from 291 open-source projects in SWE-Gym (over 13x larger than SWE-bench Verified).

Abstract: Dexterous intelligence -- the ability to perform complex interactions with multi-fingered hands -- is a pinnacle of human physical intelligence and emergent higher-order cognitive skills. However, contrary to Moravec's paradox, dexterous intelligence in humans appears simple only superficially. Many million years were spent co-evolving the human brain and hands including rich tactile sensing. Achieving human-level dexterity with robotic hands has long been a fundamental goal in robotics and represents a critical milestone toward general embodied intelligence. In this pursuit, computational sensorimotor learning has made significant progress, enabling feats such as arbitrary in-hand object reorientation. However, we observe that achieving higher levels of dexterity requires overcoming very fundamental limitations of computational sensorimotor learning.
  I develop robot learning methods for highly dexterous multi-fingered manipulation by directly addressing these limitations at their root cause. Chiefly, through key studies, this disseration progressively builds an effective framework for reinforcement learning of dexterous multi-fingered manipulation skills. These methods adopt structured exploration, effectively overcoming the limitations of random exploration in reinforcement learning. The insights gained culminate in a highly effective reinforcement learning that incorporates sampling-based planning for direct exploration. Additionally, this thesis explores a new paradigm of using visuo-tactile human demonstrations for dexterity, introducing corresponding imitation learning techniques.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based tasks (e.g., node classification or link prediction). Despite their triumphs, GNNs still face challenges such as long training and inference times, difficulty in capturing complex relationships, and insufficient feature extraction. To tackle these issues, graph pre-training and graph prompt methods have garnered increasing attention for their ability to leverage large-scale datasets for initial learning and task-specific adaptation, offering potential improvements in GNN performance. However, previous research has overlooked the potential of graph prompts in optimizing models, as well as the impact of both positive and negative graph prompts on model stability and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework combining graph prompts with weight pruning, called GPAWP, which aims to enhance the performance and efficiency of graph prompts by using fewer of them. We evaluate the importance of graph prompts using an importance assessment function to determine positive and negative weights at different granularities. Through hierarchically structured pruning, we eliminate negative prompt labels, resulting in more parameter-efficient and competitively performing prompts. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GPAWP, leading to a significant reduction in parameters in node classification tasks.

<title>POIFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework for Accurate and Scalable Point-of-Interest Attribution</title>

Abstract: Accurately attributing user visits to specific Points of Interest (POIs) is a foundational task for mobility analytics, personalized services, marketing and urban planning. However, POI attribution remains challenging due to GPS inaccuracies, typically ranging from 2 to 20 meters in real-world settings, and the high spatial density of POIs in urban environments, where multiple venues can coexist within a small radius (e.g., over 50 POIs within a 100-meter radius in dense city centers). Relying on proximity is therefore often insufficient for determining which POI was actually visited. We introduce \textsf{POIFormer}, a novel Transformer-based framework for accurate and efficient POI attribution. Unlike prior approaches that rely on limited spatiotemporal, contextual, or behavioral features, \textsf{POIFormer} jointly models a rich set of signals, including spatial proximity, visit timing and duration, contextual features from POI semantics, and behavioral features from user mobility and aggregated crowd behavior patterns--using the Transformer's self-attention mechanism to jointly model complex interactions across these dimensions. By leveraging the Transformer to model a user's past and future visits (with the current visit masked) and incorporating crowd-level behavioral patterns through pre-computed KDEs, \textsf{POIFormer} enables accurate, efficient attribution in large, noisy mobility datasets. Its architecture supports generalization across diverse data sources and geographic contexts while avoiding reliance on hard-to-access or unavailable data layers, making it practical for real-world deployment. Extensive experiments on real-world mobility datasets demonstrate significant improvements over existing baselines, particularly in challenging real-world settings characterized by spatial noise and dense POI clustering.

Abstract: Health misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly challenged public health efforts globally. This study applies the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) to enhance misinformation detection on social media using a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The model aims to enhance the detection accuracy and reliability of misinformation classification by integrating ELM-based features such as text readability, sentiment polarity, and heuristic cues (e.g., punctuation frequency). The enhanced model achieved an accuracy of 97.37%, precision of 96.88%, recall of 98.50%, F1-score of 97.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.50%. A combined model incorporating feature engineering further improved performance, achieving a precision of 98.88%, recall of 99.80%, F1-score of 99.41%, and ROC-AUC of 99.80%. These findings highlight the value of ELM features in improving detection performance, offering valuable contextual information. This study demonstrates the practical application of psychological theories in developing advanced machine learning algorithms to address health misinformation effectively.

Abstract: This work presents OPENXRD, an open-book pipeline designed for crystallography question answering, which integrates textual prompts with concise supporting content generated by GPT-4.5. Instead of using scanned textbooks, which may lead to copyright issues, OPENXRD generates compact, domain-specific references that help smaller models understand key concepts in X-ray diffraction (XRD). We evaluate OPENXRD on a well-defined set of 217 expert-level XRD questions by comparing different vision-language models, including GPT-4 and LLaVA-based frameworks such as Mistral, LLaMA, and QWEN, under both closed-book (without supporting material) and open-book (with supporting material) conditions. Our experimental results show significant accuracy improvements in models that use the GPT-4.5-generated summaries, particularly those with limited prior training in crystallography. OPENXRD uses knowledge from larger models to fill knowledge gaps in crystallography and shows that AI-generated texts can help smaller models reason more effectively in scientific tasks. While the current version of OPENXRD focuses on text-based inputs, we also explore future extensions such as adding real crystal diagrams or diffraction patterns to improve interpretation in specialized materials science contexts. Overall, OPENXRD shows that specialized open-book systems can be useful in materials science and provides a foundation for broader natural language processing (NLP) tools in critical scientific fields.

<title>Automatic Contouring of Spinal Vertebrae on X-Ray using a Novel Sandwich U-Net Architecture</title>

Abstract: In spinal vertebral mobility disease, accurately extracting and contouring vertebrae is essential for assessing mobility impairments and monitoring variations during flexion-extension movements. Precise vertebral contouring plays a crucial role in surgical planning; however, this process is traditionally performed manually by radiologists or surgeons, making it labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. In particular, mobility disease analysis requires the individual contouring of each vertebra, which is both tedious and susceptible to inconsistencies. Automated methods provide a more efficient alternative, enabling vertebra identification, segmentation, and contouring with greater accuracy and reduced time consumption. In this study, we propose a novel U-Net variation designed to accurately segment thoracic vertebrae from anteroposterior view on X-Ray images. Our proposed approach, incorporating a ``sandwich" U-Net structure with dual activation functions, achieves a 4.1\% improvement in Dice score compared to the baseline U-Net model, enhancing segmentation accuracy while ensuring reliable vertebral contour extraction.

<title>Towards Interpretable Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction: A Graph-Based Approach with Molecular and Network-Level Explanations</title>

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology, often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently, overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs. Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling (CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.

<title>Continual Reinforcement Learning by Planning with Online World Models</title>

Abstract: Continual reinforcement learning (CRL) refers to a naturalistic setting where an agent needs to endlessly evolve, by trial and error, to solve multiple tasks that are presented sequentially. One of the largest obstacles to CRL is that the agent may forget how to solve previous tasks when learning a new task, known as catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose to address this challenge by planning with online world models. Specifically, we learn a Follow-The-Leader shallow model online to capture the world dynamics, in which we plan using model predictive control to solve a set of tasks specified by any reward functions. The online world model is immune to forgetting by construction with a proven regret bound of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{K^2D\log(T)})$ under mild assumptions. The planner searches actions solely based on the latest online model, thus forming a FTL Online Agent (OA) that updates incrementally. To assess OA, we further design Continual Bench, a dedicated environment for CRL, and compare with several strong baselines under the same model-planning algorithmic framework. The empirical results show that OA learns continuously to solve new tasks while not forgetting old skills, outperforming agents built on deep world models with various continual learning techniques.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) demonstrate significant potential to revolutionize weather forecasting. However, most AI-driven models rely on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems for initial condition preparation, which often consumes hours on supercomputers. Here we introduce XiChen, the first observation-scalable fully AI-driven global weather forecasting system, whose entire pipeline, from Data Assimilation (DA) to medium-range forecasting, can be accomplished within only 17 seconds. XiChen is built upon a foundation model that is pre-trained for weather forecasting. Meanwhile, this model is subsequently fine-tuned to serve as both observation operators and DA models, thereby scalably assimilating conventional and raw satellite observations. Furthermore, the integration of four-dimensional variational knowledge ensures that XiChen's DA and medium-range forecasting accuracy rivals that of operational NWP systems, amazingly achieving a skillful forecasting lead time exceeding 8.25 days. These findings demonstrate that XiChen holds strong potential toward fully AI-driven weather forecasting independent of NWP systems.

Abstract: There has been increasing interest in the generation of high-quality, realistic synthetic medical images in recent years. Such synthetic datasets can mitigate the scarcity of public datasets for artificial intelligence research, and can also be used for educational purposes. In this paper, we propose a combination of diffusion-based generation (PanoDiff) and Super-Resolution (SR) for generating synthetic dental panoramic radiographs (PRs). The former generates a low-resolution (LR) seed of a PR (256 X 128) which is then processed by the SR model to yield a high-resolution (HR) PR of size 1024 X 512. For SR, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer that learns local-global relationships, resulting in sharper edges and textures. Experimental results demonstrate a Frechet inception distance score of 40.69 between 7243 real and synthetic images (in HR). Inception scores were 2.55, 2.30, 2.90 and 2.98 for real HR, synthetic HR, real LR and synthetic LR images, respectively. Among a diverse group of six clinical experts, all evaluating a mixture of 100 synthetic and 100 real PRs in a time-limited observation, the average accuracy in distinguishing real from synthetic images was 68.5% (with 50% corresponding to random guessing).

Abstract: Context-aware emotion recognition (CAER) enhances affective computing in real-world scenarios, but traditional methods often suffer from context bias-spurious correlation between background context and emotion labels (e.g. associating ``garden'' with ``happy''). In this paper, we propose \textbf{AGCD-Net}, an Attention Guided Context Debiasing model that introduces \textit{Hybrid ConvNeXt}, a novel convolutional encoder that extends the ConvNeXt backbone by integrating Spatial Transformer Network and Squeeze-and-Excitation layers for enhanced feature recalibration. At the core of AGCD-Net is the Attention Guided - Causal Intervention Module (AG-CIM), which applies causal theory, perturbs context features, isolates spurious correlations, and performs an attention-driven correction guided by face features to mitigate context bias. Experimental results on the CAER-S dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AGCD-Net, achieving state-of-the-art performance and highlighting the importance of causal debiasing for robust emotion recognition in complex settings.

Abstract: Patch-based transformer surrogates have become increasingly effective for modeling spatiotemporal dynamics, but the fixed patch size is a major limitation for budget-conscience deployment in production. We introduce two lightweight, architecture-agnostic modules-the Convolutional Kernel Modulator (CKM) and Convolutional Stride Modulator (CSM)-that enable dynamic patch size control at inference in patch based models, without retraining or accuracy loss. Combined with a cyclic patch-size rollout, our method mitigates patch artifacts and improves long-term stability for video-like prediction tasks. Applied to a range of challenging 2D and 3D PDE benchmarks, our approach improves rollout fidelity and runtime efficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to enable inference-time patch-size tunability in patch-based PDE surrogates. Its plug-and-play design makes it broadly applicable across architectures-establishing a general foundation for compute-adaptive modeling in PDE surrogate tasks.

Abstract: Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have demonstrated rich potential in computer vision domain due to their high biological plausibility, event-driven characteristic and energy-saving efficiency. Still, limited annotated event-based datasets and immature SNN architectures result in their performance inferior to that of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). To enhance the performance of SNNs on their optimal data format, DVS data, we explore using RGB data and well-performing ANNs to implement knowledge distillation. In this case, solving cross-modality and cross-architecture challenges is necessary. In this paper, we propose cross knowledge distillation (CKD), which not only leverages semantic similarity and sliding replacement to mitigate the cross-modality challenge, but also uses an indirect phased knowledge distillation to mitigate the cross-architecture challenge. We validated our method on main-stream neuromorphic datasets, including N-Caltech101 and CEP-DVS. The experimental results show that our method outperforms current State-of-the-Art methods.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Abstract: The remarkable representational power of Vision Transformers (ViTs) remains underutilized in few-shot image classification. In this work, we introduce ViT-ProtoNet, which integrates a ViT-Small backbone into the Prototypical Network framework. By averaging class conditional token embeddings from a handful of support examples, ViT-ProtoNet constructs robust prototypes that generalize to novel categories under 5-shot settings. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on four standard benchmarks: Mini-ImageNet, FC100, CUB-200, and CIFAR-FS, including overlapped support variants to assess robustness. Across all splits, ViT-ProtoNet consistently outperforms CNN-based prototypical counterparts, achieving up to a 3.2\% improvement in 5-shot accuracy and demonstrating superior feature separability in latent space. Furthermore, it outperforms or is competitive with transformer-based competitors using a more lightweight backbone. Comprehensive ablations examine the impact of transformer depth, patch size, and fine-tuning strategy. To foster reproducibility, we release code and pretrained weights. Our results establish ViT-ProtoNet as a powerful, flexible approach for few-shot classification and set a new baseline for transformer-based meta-learners.

Abstract: Recent advances in latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable results in high-fidelity RGB image synthesis by leveraging pretrained VAEs to compress and reconstruct pixel data at low computational cost. However, the generation of transparent or layered content (RGBA image) remains largely unexplored, due to the lack of large-scale benchmarks. In this work, we propose ALPHA, the first comprehensive RGBA benchmark that adapts standard RGB metrics to four-channel images via alpha blending over canonical backgrounds. We further introduce ALPHAVAE, a unified end-to-end RGBA VAE that extends a pretrained RGB VAE by incorporating a dedicated alpha channel. The model is trained with a composite objective that combines alpha-blended pixel reconstruction, patch-level fidelity, perceptual consistency, and dual KL divergence constraints to ensure latent fidelity across both RGB and alpha representations. Our RGBA VAE, trained on only 8K images in contrast to 1M used by prior methods, achieves a +4.9 dB improvement in PSNR and a +3.2% increase in SSIM over LayerDiffuse in reconstruction. It also enables superior transparent image generation when fine-tuned within a latent diffusion framework. Our code, data, and models are released on https://github.com/o0o0o00o0/AlphaVAE for reproducibility.

Abstract: Purpose: This study introduces a novel framework for identifying and exploiting predictive lead-lag relationships in financial markets. We propose an integrated approach that combines advanced statistical methodologies with machine learning models to enhance the identification and exploitation of predictive relationships between equities. Methods: We employed a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to cluster nine prominent stocks based on their mid-range historical volatility profiles over a three-year period. From the resulting clusters, we constructed a multi-stage causal inference pipeline, incorporating the Granger Causality Test (GCT), a customised Peter-Clark Momentary Conditional Independence (PCMCI) test, and Effective Transfer Entropy (ETE) to identify robust, predictive linkages. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier were utilised to determine the optimal time lag for trade execution. The resulting strategy was rigorously backtested. Results: The proposed volatility-based trading strategy, tested from 8 June 2023 to 12 August 2023, demonstrated substantial efficacy. The portfolio yielded a total return of 15.38%, significantly outperforming the 10.39% return of a comparative Buy-and-Hold strategy. Key performance metrics, including a Sharpe Ratio up to 2.17 and a win rate up to 100% for certain pairs, confirmed the strategy's viability. Conclusion: This research contributes a systematic and robust methodology for identifying profitable trading opportunities derived from volatility-based causal relationships. The findings have significant implications for both academic research in financial modelling and the practical application of algorithmic trading, offering a structured approach to developing resilient, data-driven strategies.

Abstract: Time series data with missing values is common across many domains. Healthcare presents special challenges due to prolonged periods of sensor disconnection. In such cases, having a confidence measure for imputed values is critical. Most existing methods either overlook model uncertainty or lack mechanisms to estimate it. To address this gap, we introduce a general framework that quantifies and leverages uncertainty for selective imputation. By focusing on values the model is most confident in, highly unreliable imputations are avoided. Our experiments on multiple EHR datasets, covering diverse types of missingness, demonstrate that selectively imputing less-uncertain values not only reduces imputation errors but also improves downstream tasks. Specifically, we show performance gains in a 24-hour mortality prediction task, underscoring the practical benefit of incorporating uncertainty into time series imputation.

<title>Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis</title>

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized nucleotide sequence analysis, yet capturing long-range dependencies remains challenging. Recent studies show that autoregressive transformers often exhibit Markovian behavior by relying on fixed-length context windows for next-token prediction. However, standard self-attention mechanisms are computationally inefficient for long sequences due to their quadratic complexity and do not explicitly enforce global transition consistency.
  We introduce CARMANIA (Context-Aware Regularization with Markovian Integration for Attention-Based Nucleotide Analysis), a self-supervised pretraining framework that augments next-token (NT) prediction with a transition-matrix (TM) loss. The TM loss aligns predicted token transitions with empirically derived n-gram statistics from each input sequence, encouraging the model to capture higher-order dependencies beyond local context. This integration enables CARMANIA to learn organism-specific sequence structures that reflect both evolutionary constraints and functional organization.
  We evaluate CARMANIA across diverse genomic tasks, including regulatory element prediction, functional gene classification, taxonomic inference, antimicrobial resistance detection, and biosynthetic gene cluster classification. CARMANIA outperforms the previous best long-context model by at least 7 percent, matches state-of-the-art on shorter sequences (exceeding prior results on 20 out of 40 tasks while running approximately 2.5 times faster), and shows particularly strong improvements on enhancer and housekeeping gene classification tasks, including up to a 34 percent absolute gain in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) for enhancer prediction. The TM loss boosts accuracy in 33 of 40 tasks, especially where local motifs or regulatory patterns drive prediction.

Abstract: Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a technique for finding correlations between different data modalities and learning low-dimensional representations. As fairness becomes crucial in machine learning, fair CCA has gained attention. However, previous approaches often overlook the impact on downstream classification tasks, limiting applicability. We propose a novel fair CCA method for fair representation learning, ensuring the projected features are independent of sensitive attributes, thus enhancing fairness without compromising accuracy. We validate our method on synthetic data and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), demonstrating its ability to maintain high correlation analysis performance while improving fairness in classification tasks. Our work enables fair machine learning in neuroimaging studies where unbiased analysis is essential.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) aligned for safety through techniques like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) often exhibit emergent deceptive behaviors, where outputs appear compliant but subtly mislead or omit critical information. This paper introduces adversarial activation patching, a novel mechanistic interpretability framework that leverages activation patching as an adversarial tool to induce, detect, and mitigate such deception in transformer-based models. By sourcing activations from "deceptive" prompts and patching them into safe forward passes at specific layers, we simulate vulnerabilities and quantify deception rates. Through toy neural network simulations across multiple scenarios (e.g., 1000 trials per setup), we demonstrate that adversarial patching increases deceptive outputs to 23.9% from a 0% baseline, with layer-specific variations supporting our hypotheses. We propose six hypotheses, including transferability across models, exacerbation in multimodal settings, and scaling effects. An expanded literature review synthesizes over 20 key works in interpretability, deception, and adversarial attacks. Mitigation strategies, such as activation anomaly detection and robust fine-tuning, are detailed, alongside ethical considerations and future research directions. This work advances AI safety by highlighting patching's dual-use potential and provides a roadmap for empirical studies on large-scale models.

Abstract: The detection and tracking of celestial surface terrain features are crucial for autonomous spaceflight applications, including Terrain Relative Navigation (TRN), Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), hazard analysis, and scientific data collection. Traditional photoclinometry-based pipelines often rely on extensive a priori imaging and offline processing, constrained by the computational limitations of radiation-hardened systems. While historically effective, these approaches typically increase mission costs and duration, operate at low processing rates, and have limited generalization. Recently, learning-based computer vision has gained popularity to enhance spacecraft autonomy and overcome these limitations. While promising, emerging techniques frequently impose computational demands exceeding the capabilities of typical spacecraft hardware for real-time operation and are further challenged by the scarcity of labeled training data for diverse extraterrestrial environments. In this work, we present novel formulations for in-situ landmark tracking via detection and description. We utilize lightweight, computationally efficient neural network architectures designed for real-time execution on current-generation spacecraft flight processors. For landmark detection, we propose improved domain adaptation methods that enable the identification of celestial terrain features with distinct, cheaply acquired training data. Concurrently, for landmark description, we introduce a novel attention alignment formulation that learns robust feature representations that maintain correspondence despite significant landmark viewpoint variations. Together, these contributions form a unified system for landmark tracking that demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships in multivariate time series (MTS) is essential for effective decision-making in fields such as finance and marketing, where complex dependencies and lagged effects challenge conventional analytical approaches. We introduce Dynamic Sparse Causal-Attention Temporal Networks for Interpretable Causality Discovery in MTS (DyCAST-Net), a novel architecture designed to enhance causal discovery by integrating dilated temporal convolutions and dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. DyCAST-Net effectively captures multiscale temporal dependencies through dilated convolutions while leveraging an adaptive thresholding strategy in its attention mechanism to eliminate spurious connections, ensuring both accuracy and interpretability. A statistical shuffle test validation further strengthens robustness by filtering false positives and improving causal inference reliability. Extensive evaluations on financial and marketing datasets demonstrate that DyCAST-Net consistently outperforms existing models such as TCDF, GCFormer, and CausalFormer. The model provides a more precise estimation of causal delays and significantly reduces false discoveries, particularly in noisy environments. Moreover, attention heatmaps offer interpretable insights, uncovering hidden causal patterns such as the mediated effects of advertising on consumer behavior and the influence of macroeconomic indicators on financial markets. Case studies illustrate DyCAST-Net's ability to detect latent mediators and lagged causal factors, making it particularly effective in high-dimensional, dynamic settings. The model's architecture enhanced by RMSNorm stabilization and causal masking ensures scalability and adaptability across diverse application domains

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful capability of large pretrained transformers, enabling them to solve new tasks implicit in example input-output pairs without any gradient updates. Despite its practical success, the mechanisms underlying ICL remain largely mysterious. In this work we study synthetic linear regression to probe how transformers implement learning at inference time. Previous works have demonstrated that transformers match the performance of learning rules such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression or gradient descent and have suggested ICL is facilitated in transformers through the learned implementation of one of these techniques. In this work, we demonstrate through a suite of out-of-distribution generalization experiments that transformers trained for ICL fail to generalize after shifts in the prompt distribution, a behaviour that is inconsistent with the notion of transformers implementing algorithms such as OLS. Finally, we highlight the role of the pretraining corpus in shaping ICL behaviour through a spectral analysis of the learned representations in the residual stream. Inputs from the same distribution as the training data produce representations with a unique spectral signature: inputs from this distribution tend to have the same top two singular vectors. This spectral signature is not shared by out-of-distribution inputs, and a metric characterizing the presence of this signature is highly correlated with low loss.

<title>Fourier Basis Mapping: A Time-Frequency Learning Framework for Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: The integration of Fourier transform and deep learning opens new avenues for time series forecasting. We reconsider the Fourier transform from a basis functions perspective. Specifically, the real and imaginary parts of the frequency components can be regarded as the coefficients of cosine and sine basis functions at tiered frequency levels, respectively. We find that existing Fourier-based methods face inconsistent starting cycles and inconsistent series length issues. They fail to interpret frequency components precisely and overlook temporal information. Accordingly, the novel Fourier Basis Mapping (FBM) method addresses these issues by integrating time-frequency features through Fourier basis expansion and mapping in the time-frequency space. Our approach extracts explicit frequency features while preserving temporal characteristics. FBM supports plug-and-play integration with various types of neural networks by only adjusting the first initial projection layer for better performance. First, we propose FBM-L, FBM-NL, and FBM-NP to enhance linear, MLP-based, and Transformer-based models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of time-frequency features. Next, we propose a synergetic model architecture, termed FBM-S, which decomposes the seasonal, trend, and interaction effects into three separate blocks, each designed to model time-frequency features in a specialized manner. Finally, we introduce several techniques tailored for time-frequency features, including interaction masking, centralization, patching, rolling window projection, and multi-scale down-sampling. The results are validated on diverse real-world datasets for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with SOTA performance.

<title>Enhancing ALS Progression Tracking with Semi-Supervised ALSFRS-R Scores Estimated from Ambient Home Health Monitoring</title>

Abstract: Clinical monitoring of functional decline in ALS relies on periodic assessments that may miss critical changes occurring between visits. To address this gap, semi-supervised regression models were developed to estimate rates of decline in a case series cohort by targeting ALSFRS- R scale trajectories with continuous in-home sensor monitoring data. Our analysis compared three model paradigms (individual batch learning and cohort-level batch versus incremental fine-tuned transfer learning) across linear slope, cubic polynomial, and ensembled self-attention pseudo-label interpolations. Results revealed cohort homogeneity across functional domains responding to learning methods, with transfer learning improving prediction error for ALSFRS-R subscales in 28 of 32 contrasts (mean RMSE=0.20(0.04)), and individual batch learning for predicting the composite scale (mean RMSE=3.15(1.25)) in 2 of 3. Self-attention interpolation achieved the lowest prediction error for subscale-level models (mean RMSE=0.19(0.06)), capturing complex nonlinear progression patterns, outperforming linear and cubic interpolations in 20 of 32 contrasts, though linear interpolation proved more stable in all ALSFRS-R composite scale models (mean RMSE=0.23(0.10)). We identified distinct homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles across functional domains with respiratory and speech exhibiting patient-specific patterns benefiting from personalized incremental adaptation, while swallowing and dressing functions followed cohort-level trajectories suitable for transfer models. These findings suggest that matching learning and pseudo-labeling techniques to functional domain-specific homogeneity-heterogeneity profiles enhances predictive accuracy in ALS progression tracking. Integrating adaptive model selection within sensor monitoring platforms could enable timely interventions and scalable deployment in future multi-center studies.

Abstract: This study explores the optimization of the DRAGON Longformer base model for clinical text classification, specifically targeting the binary classification of medical case descriptions. A dataset of 500 clinical cases containing structured medical observations was used, with 400 cases for training and 100 for validation. Enhancements to the pre-trained joeranbosma/dragon-longformer-base-mixed-domain model included hyperparameter tuning, domain-specific preprocessing, and architectural adjustments. Key modifications involved increasing sequence length from 512 to 1024 tokens, adjusting learning rates from 1e-05 to 5e-06, extending training epochs from 5 to 8, and incorporating specialized medical terminology. The optimized model achieved notable performance gains: accuracy improved from 72.0% to 85.2%, precision from 68.0% to 84.1%, recall from 75.0% to 86.3%, and F1-score from 71.0% to 85.2%. Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements (p < .001). The model demonstrated enhanced capability in interpreting medical terminology, anatomical measurements, and clinical observations. These findings contribute to domain-specific language model research and offer practical implications for clinical natural language processing applications. The optimized model's strong performance across diverse medical conditions underscores its potential for broad use in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lifts the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by injecting external knowledge, yet it falls short on problems that demand multi-step inference; conversely, purely reasoning-oriented approaches often hallucinate or mis-ground facts. This survey synthesizes both strands under a unified reasoning-retrieval perspective. We first map how advanced reasoning optimizes each stage of RAG (Reasoning-Enhanced RAG). Then, we show how retrieved knowledge of different type supply missing premises and expand context for complex inference (RAG-Enhanced Reasoning). Finally, we spotlight emerging Synergized RAG-Reasoning frameworks, where (agentic) LLMs iteratively interleave search and reasoning to achieve state-of-the-art performance across knowledge-intensive benchmarks. We categorize methods, datasets, and open challenges, and outline research avenues toward deeper RAG-Reasoning systems that are more effective, multimodally-adaptive, trustworthy, and human-centric.

<title>Evaluating LLMs on Sequential API Call Through Automated Test Generation</title>

Abstract: By integrating tools from external APIs, Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their promising capabilities in a diverse spectrum of complex real-world tasks. However, testing, evaluation, and analysis of LLM tool use remain in their early stages. Most existing benchmarks rely on manually collected test cases, many of which cannot be automatically checked for semantic correctness and instead depend on static methods such as string matching. Additionally, these benchmarks often overlook the complex interactions that occur between sequential API calls, which are common in real-world applications. To fill the gap, in this paper, we introduce StateGen, an automated framework designed to generate diverse coding tasks involving sequential API interactions. StateGen combines state-machine-based API constraint solving and validation, energy-based sampling, and control-flow injection to generate executable programs. These programs are then translated into human-like natural language task descriptions through a collaboration of two LLM agents. Utilizing StateGen, we construct StateEval, a benchmark encompassing 120 verified test cases spanning across three representative scenarios: Session Service, Tensor Operation, and ElevenLabs MCP. Experimental results confirm that StateGen can effectively generate challenging and realistic API-oriented tasks, highlighting areas for improvement in current LLMs incorporating APIs.

Abstract: Human emotions are complex, with sarcasm being a subtle and distinctive form. Despite progress in sarcasm research, sarcasm generation remains underexplored, primarily due to the overreliance on textual modalities and the neglect of visual cues, as well as the mismatch between image content and sarcastic intent in existing datasets. In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm generation dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic text, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation framework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive learning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of sarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor outputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation quality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate ViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including large language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation. Furthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual Incongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts exhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity (0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic content than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly available. Our dataset and code will be released at \textit{https://github.com/wclapply/ViSP}.

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner. For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the \textit{Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network} (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image classification plays a pivotal role in precision agriculture, providing accurate insights into crop health monitoring, disease detection, and soil analysis. However, traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data, spectral-spatial redundancy, and the scarcity of labeled samples, often leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose the Self-Adaptive Tensor- Regularized Network (SDTN), which combines tensor decomposition with regularization mechanisms to dynamically adjust tensor ranks, ensuring optimal feature representation tailored to the complexity of the data. Building upon SDTN, we propose the Tensor-Regularized Network (TRN), which integrates the features extracted by SDTN into a lightweight network capable of capturing spectral-spatial features at multiple scales. This approach not only maintains high classification accuracy but also significantly reduces computational complexity, making the framework highly suitable for real-time deployment in resource-constrained environments. Experiments on PaviaU datasets demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and reduced model parameters compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at sophisticated code-generation tasks, yet remain ineffective at reliably detecting or avoiding code vulnerabilities. Does this deficiency stem from insufficient learning about code vulnerabilities, or is it merely a result of ineffective prompting? Using representation engineering techniques, we investigate whether LLMs internally encode the concepts necessary to identify code vulnerabilities. We find that current LLMs encode precise internal representations that distinguish vulnerable from secure code--achieving greater accuracy than standard prompting approaches. Leveraging these vulnerability-sensitive representations, we develop an inference-time steering technique that subtly modulates the model's token-generation probabilities through a mixture of corrections (MoC). Our method effectively guides LLMs to produce less vulnerable code without compromising functionality, demonstrating a practical approach to controlled vulnerability management in generated code. Notably, MoC enhances the security ratio of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B by 8.9\%, while simultaneously improving functionality on HumanEval pass@1 by 2.1\%.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) reduce the quadratic complexity of transformers by leveraging linear recurrence. Recently, VMamba has emerged as a strong SSM-based vision backbone, yet remains bottlenecked by spatial redundancy in its four-directional scan. We propose QuarterMap, a post-training activation pruning method that removes redundant spatial activations before scanning and restores dimensions via nearest-neighbor upsampling. Our method improves throughput without retraining. On ImageNet-1K, QuarterMap achieves up to 11% speedup on VMamba with less than 0.9% accuracy drop, and yields similar gains on ADE20K segmentation. Beyond VMamba, we validate QuarterMap on MedMamba, a domain-specific model that shares the same four-directional scanning structure, where it consistently improves throughput while preserving accuracy across multiple medical imaging tasks. Compared to token merging methods like ToMe, QuarterMap is tailored for SSMs and avoids costly merge-unmerge operations. Our method offers a plug-and-play tool for deployment-time efficiency without compromising transferability.

Abstract: The hallmark feature of temporal-difference (TD) learning is bootstrapping: using value predictions to generate new value predictions. The vast majority of TD methods for control learn a policy by bootstrapping from a single action-value function (e.g., Q-learning and Sarsa). Significantly less attention has been given to methods that bootstrap from two asymmetric value functions: i.e., methods that learn state values as an intermediate step in learning action values. Existing algorithms in this vein can be categorized as either QV-learning or AV-learning. Though these algorithms have been investigated to some degree in prior work, it remains unclear if and when it is advantageous to learn two value functions instead of just one -- and whether such approaches are theoretically sound in general. In this paper, we analyze these algorithmic families in terms of convergence and sample efficiency. We find that while both families are more efficient than Expected Sarsa in the prediction setting, only AV-learning methods offer any major benefit over Q-learning in the control setting. Finally, we introduce a new AV-learning algorithm called Regularized Dueling Q-learning (RDQ), which significantly outperforms Dueling DQN in the MinAtar benchmark.

Abstract: Key Information Extraction (KIE) underpins the understanding of visual documents (e.g., receipts and contracts) by extracting precise semantic content and accurately capturing spatial structure. Yet existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often perform poorly on dense documents and rely on vision tokenization approaches that scale with image size, leading to redundant computation and memory inefficiency. To address these challenges, we introduce VDInstruct, an MLLM that separates spatial region detection from semantic feature extraction. Central to our model is a content-aware tokenization strategy: rather than fragmenting the entire image uniformly, it generates tokens in proportion to document complexity, preserving critical structure while eliminating wasted tokens. Leveraging a three-stage training paradigm, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on KIE benchmarks, matching or exceeding the accuracy of leading approaches while reducing the number of image tokens by roughly 3.6x. In zero-shot evaluations, VDInstruct surpasses strong baselines-such as DocOwl 1.5-by +5.5 F1 points, highlighting its robustness to unseen documents. These findings show that content-aware tokenization combined with explicit layout modeling offers a promising direction forward for document understanding. Data, source code, and model weights will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Using neuromorphic computing for robotics applications has gained much attention in recent year due to the remarkable ability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for high-precision yet low memory and compute complexity inference when implemented in neuromorphic hardware. This ability makes SNNs well-suited for autonomous robot applications (such as in drones and rovers) where battery resources and payload are typically limited. Within this context, this paper studies the use of SNNs for performing direct robot navigation and obstacle avoidance from LIDAR data. A custom robot platform equipped with a LIDAR is set up for collecting a labeled dataset of LIDAR sensing data together with the human-operated robot control commands used for obstacle avoidance. Crucially, this paper provides what is, to the best of our knowledge, a first focused study about the importance of neuron membrane leakage on the SNN precision when processing LIDAR data for obstacle avoidance. It is shown that by carefully tuning the membrane potential leakage constant of the spiking Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons used within our SNN, it is possible to achieve on-par robot control precision compared to the use of a non-spiking Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, the LIDAR dataset collected during this work is released as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.

We systematically organize and analyze the rapidly growing body of work in this emerging field, covering fundamental methodologies, practical applications, and key challenges. Our review reveals how prompt engineering has evolved from simple geometric inputs to sophisticated multimodal approaches, enabling SAM's adaptation across diverse domains including medical imaging and remote sensing. We identify unique challenges in prompt optimization and discuss promising research directions. This survey fills an important gap in the literature by providing a structured framework for understanding and advancing prompt engineering in foundation models for segmentation.

Abstract: A critical challenge in recommender systems is to establish reliable relationships between offline and online metrics that predict real-world performance. Motivated by recent advances in Pareto front approximation, we introduce a pragmatic strategy for identifying offline metrics that align with online impact. A key advantage of this approach is its ability to simultaneously serve multiple test groups, each with distinct offline performance metrics, in an online experiment controlled by a single model. The method is model-agnostic for systems with a neural network backbone, enabling broad applicability across architectures and domains. We validate the strategy through a large-scale online experiment in the field of session-based recommender systems on the OTTO e-commerce platform. The online experiment identifies significant alignments between offline metrics and real-word click-through rate, post-click conversion rate and units sold. Our strategy provides industry practitioners with a valuable tool for understanding offline-to-online metric relationships and making informed, data-driven decisions.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models produce high-quality results but still struggle with precise visual control, balancing multimodal inputs, and requiring extensive training for complex multimodal image generation. To address these limitations, we propose MENTOR, a novel autoregressive (AR) framework for efficient Multimodal-conditioned Tuning for Autoregressive multimodal image generation. MENTOR combines an AR image generator with a two-stage training paradigm, enabling fine-grained, token-level alignment between multimodal inputs and image outputs without relying on auxiliary adapters or cross-attention modules. The two-stage training consists of: (1) a multimodal alignment stage that establishes robust pixel- and semantic-level alignment, followed by (2) a multimodal instruction tuning stage that balances the integration of multimodal inputs and enhances generation controllability. Despite modest model size, suboptimal base components, and limited training resources, MENTOR achieves strong performance on the DreamBench++ benchmark, outperforming competitive baselines in concept preservation and prompt following. Additionally, our method delivers superior image reconstruction fidelity, broad task adaptability, and improved training efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods. Dataset, code, and models are available at: https://github.com/HaozheZhao/MENTOR

Abstract: The advent of powerful, accessible Large Language Models (LLMs) like Google's Gemini presents new opportunities for democratizing financial data analysis. This paper documents the design, implementation, and iterative debugging of a novel, serverless system for real-time stock analysis. The system leverages the Gemini API for qualitative assessment, automates data ingestion and processing via GitHub Actions, and presents the findings through a decoupled, static frontend. We detail the architectural evolution of the system, from initial concepts to a robust, event-driven pipeline, highlighting the practical challenges encountered during deployment. A significant portion of this paper is dedicated to a case study on the debugging process, covering common software errors, platform-specific permission issues, and rare, environment-level platform bugs. The final architecture operates at a near-zero cost, demonstrating a viable model for individuals to build sophisticated AI-powered financial tools. The operational application is publicly accessible, and the complete source code is available for review. We conclude by discussing the role of LLMs in financial analysis, the importance of robust debugging methodologies, and the emerging paradigm of human-AI collaboration in software development.

Abstract: We introduce the THOR (Transformer Heuristics for On-Demand Retrieval) Module, designed and implemented by eSapiens, a secure, scalable engine that transforms natural-language questions into verified, read-only SQL analytics for enterprise databases. The Text-to-SQL module follows a decoupled orchestration/execution architecture: a Supervisor Agent routes queries, Schema Retrieval dynamically injects table and column metadata, and a SQL Generation Agent emits single-statement SELECT queries protected by a read-only guardrail. An integrated Self-Correction & Rating loop captures empty results, execution errors, or low-quality outputs and triggers up to five LLM-driven regeneration attempts. Finally, a Result Interpretation Agent produces concise, human-readable insights and hands raw rows to the Insight & Intelligence engine for visualization or forecasting.
  Smoke tests across finance, sales, and operations scenarios demonstrate reliable ad-hoc querying and automated periodic reporting. By embedding schema awareness, fault-tolerant execution, and compliance guardrails, the THOR Module empowers non-technical users to access live data with zero-SQL simplicity and enterprise-grade safety.

Abstract: General-purpose sentence embedding models often struggle to capture specialized financial semantics, especially in low-resource languages like Korean, due to domain-specific jargon, temporal meaning shifts, and misaligned bilingual vocabularies. To address these gaps, we introduce NMIXX (Neural eMbeddings for Cross-lingual eXploration of Finance), a suite of cross-lingual embedding models fine-tuned with 18.8K high-confidence triplets that pair in-domain paraphrases, hard negatives derived from a semantic-shift typology, and exact Korean-English translations. Concurrently, we release KorFinSTS, a 1,921-pair Korean financial STS benchmark spanning news, disclosures, research reports, and regulations, designed to expose nuances that general benchmarks miss.
  When evaluated against seven open-license baselines, NMIXX's multilingual bge-m3 variant achieves Spearman's rho gains of +0.10 on English FinSTS and +0.22 on KorFinSTS, outperforming its pre-adaptation checkpoint and surpassing other models by the largest margin, while revealing a modest trade-off in general STS performance. Our analysis further shows that models with richer Korean token coverage adapt more effectively, underscoring the importance of tokenizer design in low-resource, cross-lingual settings. By making both models and the benchmark publicly available, we provide the community with robust tools for domain-adapted, multilingual representation learning in finance.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy. However, the rise of federated unlearning, designed to allow clients to erase their data from the global model, introduces new privacy concerns. Specifically, the gradient exchanges during the unlearning process can leak sensitive information about deleted data. In this paper, we introduce DRAGD, a novel attack that exploits gradient discrepancies before and after unlearning to reconstruct forgotten data. We also present DRAGDP, an enhanced version of DRAGD that leverages publicly available prior data to improve reconstruction accuracy, particularly for complex datasets like facial images. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DRAGD and DRAGDP significantly outperform existing methods in data reconstruction.Our work highlights a critical privacy vulnerability in federated unlearning and offers a practical solution, advancing the security of federated unlearning systems in real-world applications.

Abstract: Stroke is one of the leading causes of death globally, making early and accurate diagnosis essential for improving patient outcomes, particularly in emergency settings where timely intervention is critical. CT scans are the key imaging modality because of their speed, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness. This study proposed an artificial intelligence framework for multiclass stroke classification (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and no stroke) using CT scan images from a dataset provided by the Republic of Turkey's Ministry of Health. The proposed method adopted MaxViT, a state-of-the-art Vision Transformer, as the primary deep learning model for image-based stroke classification, with additional transformer variants (vision transformer, transformer-in-transformer, and ConvNext). To enhance model generalization and address class imbalance, we applied data augmentation techniques, including synthetic image generation. The MaxViT model trained with augmentation achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy and F1-score of 98.00%, outperforming all other evaluated models and the baseline methods. The primary goal of this study was to distinguish between stroke types with high accuracy while addressing crucial issues of transparency and trust in artificial intelligence models. To achieve this, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) was integrated into the framework, particularly Grad-CAM++. It provides visual explanations of the model's decisions by highlighting relevant stroke regions in the CT scans and establishing an accurate, interpretable, and clinically applicable solution for early stroke detection. This research contributed to the development of a trustworthy AI-assisted diagnostic tool for stroke, facilitating its integration into clinical practice and enhancing access to timely and optimal stroke diagnosis in emergency departments, thereby saving more lives.

Abstract: In recent years, the rampant spread of misinformation on social media has made accurate detection of multimodal fake news a critical research focus. However, previous research has not adequately understood the semantics of images, and models struggle to discern news authenticity with limited textual information. Meanwhile, treating all emotional types of news uniformly without tailored approaches further leads to performance degradation. Therefore, we propose a novel Knowledge Augmentation and Emotion Guidance Network (KEN). On the one hand, we effectively leverage LVLM's powerful semantic understanding and extensive world knowledge. For images, the generated captions provide a comprehensive understanding of image content and scenes, while for text, the retrieved evidence helps break the information silos caused by the closed and limited text and context. On the other hand, we consider inter-class differences between different emotional types of news through balanced learning, achieving fine-grained modeling of the relationship between emotional types and authenticity. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KEN.

Abstract: Programming-by-prompting with generative AI offers a new paradigm for end-user programming, shifting the focus from syntactic fluency to semantic intent. This shift holds particular promise for non-programmers such as educators, who can describe instructional goals in natural language to generate interactive learning content. Yet in bypassing direct code authoring, many of programming's core affordances - such as traceability, stepwise refinement, and behavioral testing - are lost. We propose the Chain-of-Abstractions (CoA) framework as a way to recover these affordances while preserving the expressive flexibility of natural language. CoA decomposes the synthesis process into a sequence of cognitively meaningful, task-aligned representations that function as checkpoints for specification, inspection, and refinement. We instantiate this approach in SimStep, an authoring environment for teachers that scaffolds simulation creation through four intermediate abstractions: Concept Graph, Scenario Graph, Learning Goal Graph, and UI Interaction Graph. To address ambiguities and misalignments, SimStep includes an inverse correction process that surfaces in-filled model assumptions and enables targeted revision without requiring users to manipulate code. Evaluations with educators show that CoA enables greater authoring control and interpretability in programming-by-prompting workflows.

Abstract: We investigate the integration of Conformal Prediction (CP) with supervised learning on deterministically encrypted data, aiming to bridge the gap between rigorous uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving machine learning. Using AES-encrypted variants of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that CP methods remain effective even when applied directly in the encrypted domain, owing to the preservation of data exchangeability under fixed-key encryption. We test traditional $p$-value-based against $e$-value-based conformal predictors. Our empirical evaluation reveals that models trained on deterministically encrypted data retain the ability to extract meaningful structure, achieving 36.88\% test accuracy -- significantly above random guessing (9.56\%) observed with per-instance encryption. Moreover, $e$-value-based CP achieves predictive set coverage of over 60\% with 4.3 loss-threshold calibration, correctly capturing the true label in 4888 out of 5000 test cases. In contrast, the $p$-value-based CP yields smaller predictive sets but with reduced coverage accuracy. These findings highlight both the promise and limitations of CP in encrypted data settings and underscore critical trade-offs between prediction set compactness and reliability. %Our work sets a foundation for principled uncertainty quantification in secure, privacy-aware learning systems.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach, OrQstrator, which is a modular framework for conducting quantum circuit optimization in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. Our framework is powered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Our orchestration engine intelligently selects among three complementary circuit optimizers: A DRL-based circuit rewriter trained to reduce depth and gate count via learned rewrite sequences; a domain-specific optimizer that performs efficient local gate resynthesis and numeric optimization; a parameterized circuit instantiator that improves compilation by optimizing template circuits during gate set translation. These modules are coordinated by a central orchestration engine that learns coordination policies based on circuit structure, hardware constraints, and backend-aware performance features such as gate count, depth, and expected fidelity. The system outputs an optimized circuit for hardware-aware transpilation and execution, leveraging techniques from an existing state-of-the-art approach, called the NISQ Analyzer, to adapt to backend constraints.

Abstract: Text classification plays a pivotal role in edge computing applications like industrial monitoring, health diagnostics, and smart assistants, where low latency and high accuracy are both key requirements. Generative classifiers, in particular, have been shown to exhibit robustness to out-of-distribution and noisy data, which is an extremely critical consideration for deployment in such real-time edge environments. However, deploying such models on edge devices faces computational and memory constraints. Post Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces model size and compute costs without retraining, making it ideal for edge deployment. In this work, we present a comprehensive comparative study of generative and discriminative Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)-based text classification models with PTQ using the Brevitas quantization library. We evaluate both types of classifier models across multiple bitwidths and assess their robustness under regular and noisy input conditions. We find that while discriminative classifiers remain robust, generative ones are more sensitive to bitwidth, calibration data used during PTQ, and input noise during quantized inference. We study the influence of class imbalance in calibration data for both types of classifiers, comparing scenarios with evenly and unevenly distributed class samples including their effect on weight adjustments and activation profiles during PTQ. Using test statistics derived from nonparametric hypothesis testing, we identify that using class imbalanced data during calibration introduces insufficient weight adaptation at lower bitwidths for generative LSTM classifiers, thereby leading to degraded performance. This study underscores the role of calibration data in PTQ and when generative classifiers succeed or fail under noise, aiding deployment in edge environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive open-source framework for developing correlation kernels, with a particular focus on user-defined and composition of kernels for surrogate modeling. By advancing kernel-based modeling techniques, we incorporate frequency-aware elements that effectively capture complex mechanical behaviors and timefrequency dynamics intrinsic to aircraft systems. Traditional kernel functions, often limited to exponential-based methods, are extended to include a wider range of kernels such as exponential squared sine and rational quadratic kernels, along with their respective firstand second-order derivatives. The proposed methodologies are first validated on a sinus cardinal test case and then applied to forecasting Mauna-Loa Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations and airline passenger traffic. All these advancements are integrated into the open-source Surrogate Modeling Toolbox (SMT 2.0), providing a versatile platform for both standard and customizable kernel configurations. Furthermore, the framework enables the combination of various kernels to leverage their unique strengths into composite models tailored to specific problems. The resulting framework offers a flexible toolset for engineers and researchers, paving the way for numerous future applications in metamodeling for complex, frequency-sensitive domains.

Abstract: We present EPT-2, the latest iteration in our Earth Physics Transformer (EPT) family of foundation AI models for Earth system forecasting. EPT-2 delivers substantial improvements over its predecessor, EPT-1.5, and sets a new state of the art in predicting energy-relevant variables-including 10m and 100m wind speed, 2m temperature, and surface solar radiation-across the full 0-240h forecast horizon. It consistently outperforms leading AI weather models such as Microsoft Aurora, as well as the operational numerical forecast system IFS HRES from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). In parallel, we introduce a perturbation-based ensemble model of EPT-2 for probabilistic forecasting, called EPT-2e. Remarkably, EPT-2e significantly surpasses the ECMWF ENS mean-long considered the gold standard for medium- to longrange forecasting-while operating at a fraction of the computational cost. EPT models, as well as third-party forecasts, are accessible via the app.jua.ai platform.

Abstract: Ants achieve robust visual homing with minimal sensory input and only a few learning walks, inspiring biomimetic solutions for autonomous navigation. While Mushroom Body (MB) models have been used in robotic route following, they have not yet been applied to visual homing. We present the first real-world implementation of a lateralized MB architecture for visual homing onboard a compact autonomous car-like robot. We test whether the sign of the angular path integration (PI) signal can categorize panoramic views, acquired during learning walks and encoded in the MB, into "goal on the left" and "goal on the right" memory banks, enabling robust homing in natural outdoor settings. We validate this approach through four incremental experiments: (1) simulation showing attractor-like nest dynamics; (2) real-world homing after decoupled learning walks, producing nest search behavior; (3) homing after random walks using noisy PI emulated with GPS-RTK; and (4) precise stopping-at-the-goal behavior enabled by a fifth MB Output Neuron (MBON) encoding goal-views to control velocity. This mimics the accurate homing behavior of ants and functionally resembles waypoint-based position control in robotics, despite relying solely on visual input. Operating at 8 Hz on a Raspberry Pi 4 with 32x32 pixel views and a memory footprint under 9 kB, our system offers a biologically grounded, resource-efficient solution for autonomous visual homing.

Abstract: We present the first foundational AI model for universal physics simulation that learns physical laws directly from boundary-condition data without requiring a priori equation encoding. Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and finite-difference methods necessitate explicit mathematical formulation of governing equations, fundamentally limiting their generalizability and discovery potential. Our sketch-guided diffusion transformer approach reimagines computational physics by treating simulation as a conditional generation problem, where spatial boundary conditions guide the synthesis of physically accurate steady-state solutions.
  By leveraging enhanced diffusion transformer architectures with novel spatial relationship encoding, our model achieves direct boundary-to-equilibrium mapping and is generalizable to diverse physics domains. Unlike sequential time-stepping methods that accumulate errors over iterations, our approach bypasses temporal integration entirely, directly generating steady-state solutions with SSIM > 0.8 while maintaining sub-pixel boundary accuracy. Our data-informed approach enables physics discovery through learned representations analyzable via Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), revealing emergent physical relationships without predetermined mathematical constraints. This work represents a paradigm shift from AI-accelerated physics to AI-discovered physics, establishing the first truly universal physics simulation framework.

Abstract: Pneumonia is a leading cause of mortality in children under five, requiring accurate chest X-ray diagnosis. This study presents a machine learning-based Pediatric Chest Pneumonia Classification System to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The CNN-based model was trained on 5,863 labeled chest X-ray images from children aged 0-5 years from the Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center. To address limited data, we applied augmentation techniques (rotation, zooming, shear, horizontal flipping) and employed GANs to generate synthetic images, addressing class imbalance. The system achieved optimal performance using combined original, augmented, and GAN-generated data, evaluated through accuracy and F1 score metrics. The final model was deployed via a Flask web application, enabling real-time classification with probability estimates. Results demonstrate the potential of deep learning and GANs in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency for pediatric pneumonia classification, particularly valuable in resource-limited clinical settings https://github.com/AbdulManaf12/Pediatric-Chest-Pneumonia-Classification

Abstract: Hacker forums provide critical early warning signals for emerging cybersecurity threats, but extracting actionable intelligence from their unstructured and noisy content remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an unsupervised framework that automatically detects, clusters, and prioritizes security events discussed across hacker forum posts. Our approach leverages Transformer-based embeddings fine-tuned with contrastive learning to group related discussions into distinct security event clusters, identifying incidents like zero-day disclosures or malware releases without relying on predefined keywords. The framework incorporates a daily ranking mechanism that prioritizes identified events using quantifiable metrics reflecting timeliness, source credibility, information completeness, and relevance. Experimental evaluation on real-world hacker forum data demonstrates that our method effectively reduces noise and surfaces high-priority threats, enabling security analysts to mount proactive responses. By transforming disparate hacker forum discussions into structured, actionable intelligence, our work addresses fundamental challenges in automated threat detection and analysis.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Health (SOH) is essential for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) across a wide range of industrial applications. We propose a novel framework -- Reinforced Graph-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks Enhanced with Dynamic Weights (RGPD) -- that combines physics-based supervision with advanced spatio-temporal learning. Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GCRNs) embed graph-convolutional filters within recurrent units to capture how node representations evolve over time. Graph Attention Convolution (GATConv) leverages a self-attention mechanism to compute learnable, edge-wise attention coefficients, dynamically weighting neighbor contributions for adaptive spatial aggregation. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) module is positioned between the Temporal Attention Unit (TAU) and GCRN to further improve the spatio-temporal learning. This module improves attention and prediction accuracy by dynamically scaling hidden representations to minimize noise and highlight informative features. To identify the most relevant physical constraints in each area, Q-learning agents dynamically assign weights to physics-informed loss terms, improving generalization across real-time industrial systems and reducing the need for manual tuning. In both RUL and SOH estimation tasks, the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, demonstrating strong robustness and predictive accuracy across varied degradation patterns across three diverse industrial benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Bit-level sparsity in quantized deep neural networks (DNNs) offers significant potential for optimizing Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. However, two key challenges still limit its practical exploitation. First, conventional bit-serial approaches cannot simultaneously leverage the sparsity of both factors, leading to a complete waste of one factor' s sparsity. Methods designed to exploit dual-factor sparsity are still in the early stages of exploration, facing the challenge of partial product explosion. Second, the fluctuation of bit-level sparsity leads to variable cycle counts for MAC operations. Existing synchronous scheduling schemes that are suitable for dual-factor sparsity exhibit poor flexibility and still result in significant underutilization of MAC units. To address the first challenge, this study proposes a MAC unit that leverages dual-factor sparsity through the emerging particlization-based approach. The proposed design addresses the issue of partial product explosion through simple control logic, resulting in a more area- and energy-efficient MAC unit. In addition, by discarding less significant intermediate results, the design allows for further hardware simplification at the cost of minor accuracy loss. To address the second challenge, a quasi-synchronous scheme is introduced that adds cycle-level elasticity to the MAC array, reducing pipeline stalls and thereby improving MAC unit utilization. Evaluation results show that the exact version of the proposed MAC array architecture achieves a 29.2% improvement in area efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art bit-sparsity-driven architecture, while maintaining comparable energy efficiency. The approximate variant further improves energy efficiency by 7.5%, compared to the exact version. Index-Terms: DNN acceleration, Bit-level sparsity, MAC unit

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) have led to a new class of autonomous agents, renewing and expanding interest in the area. LLM-powered Multiagent Systems (MAS) have thus emerged, both for assistive and simulation purposes, yet tools for realistic human behavior simulation -- with its distinctive challenges and opportunities -- remain underdeveloped. Existing MAS libraries and tools lack fine-grained persona specifications, population sampling facilities, experimentation support, and integrated validation, among other key capabilities, limiting their utility for behavioral studies, social simulation, and related applications. To address these deficiencies, in this work we introduce TinyTroupe, a simulation toolkit enabling detailed persona definitions (e.g., nationality, age, occupation, personality, beliefs, behaviors) and programmatic control via numerous LLM-driven mechanisms. This allows for the concise formulation of behavioral problems of practical interest, either at the individual or group level, and provides effective means for their solution. TinyTroupe's components are presented using representative working examples, such as brainstorming and market research sessions, thereby simultaneously clarifying their purpose and demonstrating their usefulness. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations of selected aspects are also provided, highlighting possibilities, limitations, and trade-offs. The approach, though realized as a specific Python implementation, is meant as a novel conceptual contribution, which can be partially or fully incorporated in other contexts. The library is available as open source at https://github.com/microsoft/tinytroupe.

Abstract: Software systems usually provide numerous configuration options that can affect performance metrics such as execution time, memory usage, binary size, or bitrate. On the one hand, making informed decisions is challenging and requires domain expertise in options and their combinations. On the other hand, machine learning techniques can search vast configuration spaces, but with a high computational cost, since concrete executions of numerous configurations are required. In this exploratory study, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can assist in performance-oriented software configuration through prompts. We evaluate several LLMs on tasks including identifying relevant options, ranking configurations, and recommending performant configurations across various configurable systems, such as compilers, video encoders, and SAT solvers. Our preliminary results reveal both positive abilities and notable limitations: depending on the task and systems, LLMs can well align with expert knowledge, whereas hallucinations or superficial reasoning can emerge in other cases. These findings represent a first step toward systematic evaluations and the design of LLM-based solutions to assist with software configuration.

Abstract: Computer-aided design (CAD) is the digital construction of 2D and 3D objects, and is central to a wide range of engineering and manufacturing applications like automobile and aviation. Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.

<title>Federated Learning with Graph-Based Aggregation for Traffic Forecasting</title>

Abstract: In traffic prediction, the goal is to estimate traffic speed or flow in specific regions or road segments using historical data collected by devices deployed in each area. Each region or road segment can be viewed as an individual client that measures local traffic flow, making Federated Learning (FL) a suitable approach for collaboratively training models without sharing raw data. In centralized FL, a central server collects and aggregates model updates from multiple clients to build a shared model while preserving each client's data privacy. Standard FL methods, such as Federated Averaging (FedAvg), assume that clients are independent, which can limit performance in traffic prediction tasks where spatial relationships between clients are important. Federated Graph Learning methods can capture these dependencies during server-side aggregation, but they often introduce significant computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a lightweight graph-aware FL approach that blends the simplicity of FedAvg with key ideas from graph learning. Rather than training full models, our method applies basic neighbourhood aggregation principles to guide parameter updates, weighting client models based on graph connectivity. This approach captures spatial relationships effectively while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate our method on two benchmark traffic datasets, METR-LA and PEMS-BAY, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to standard baselines and recent graph-based federated learning techniques.

Abstract: Neural networks are capable of superposition -- representing more features than there are dimensions. Recent work considers the analogous concept for computation instead of storage, proposing theoretical constructions. But there has been little investigation into whether these circuits can be learned in practice. In this work, we investigate a toy model for the Universal-AND problem which computes the AND of all $m\choose 2$ pairs of $m$ sparse inputs. The hidden dimension that determines the number of non-linear activations is restricted to pressure the model to find a compute-efficient circuit, called compressed computation. We find that the training process finds a simple solution that does not correspond to theoretical constructions. It is fully dense -- every neuron contributes to every output. The solution circuit naturally scales with dimension, trading off error rates for neuron efficiency. It is similarly robust to changes in sparsity and other key parameters, and extends naturally to other boolean operations and boolean circuits. We explain the found solution in detail and compute why it is more efficient than the theoretical constructions at low sparsity. Our findings shed light on the types of circuits that models like to form and the flexibility of the superposition representation. This contributes to a broader understanding of network circuitry and interpretability.

Abstract: Neural networks have achieved remarkable success in time series classification, but their reliance on large amounts of labeled data for training limits their applicability in cold-start scenarios. Moreover, they lack interpretability, reducing transparency in decision-making. In contrast, dynamic time warping (DTW) combined with a nearest neighbor classifier is widely used for its effectiveness in limited-data settings and its inherent interpretability. However, as a non-parametric method, it is not trainable and cannot leverage large amounts of labeled data, making it less effective than neural networks in rich-resource scenarios. In this work, we aim to develop a versatile model that adapts to cold-start conditions and becomes trainable with labeled data, while maintaining interpretability. We propose a dynamic length-shortening algorithm that transforms time series into prototypes while preserving key structural patterns, thereby enabling the reformulation of the DTW recurrence relation into an equivalent recurrent neural network. Based on this, we construct a trainable model that mimics DTW's alignment behavior. As a neural network, it becomes trainable when sufficient labeled data is available, while still retaining DTW's inherent interpretability. We apply the model to several benchmark time series classification tasks and observe that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in low-resource settings and remains competitive in rich-resource settings.

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) models latent cognitive states of human learners by analyzing their response patterns on diagnostic tests, serving as a crucial machine learning technique for educational assessment and evaluation. Traditional cognitive diagnosis models typically follow a transductive prediction paradigm that optimizes parameters to fit response scores and extract learner abilities. These approaches face significant limitations as they cannot perform instant diagnosis for new learners without computationally expensive retraining and produce diagnostic outputs with limited reliability. In this study, we introduces a novel generative diagnosis paradigm that fundamentally shifts CD from predictive to generative modeling, enabling inductive inference of cognitive states without parameter re-optimization. We propose two simple yet effective instantiations of this paradigm: Generative Item Response Theory (G-IRT) and Generative Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model (G-NCDM), which achieve excellent performance improvements over traditional methods. The generative approach disentangles cognitive state inference from response prediction through a well-designed generation process that incorporates identifiability and monotonicity conditions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology in addressing scalability and reliability challenges, especially $\times 100$ speedup for the diagnosis of new learners. Our framework opens new avenues for cognitive diagnosis applications in artificial intelligence, particularly for intelligent model evaluation and intelligent education systems.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming increasingly popular, with their applications now extending beyond just a mode of transportation to serving as mobile actuators of a traffic flow to control flow dynamics. This contrasts with traditional fixed-location actuators, such as traffic signals, and is referred to as Lagrangian traffic control. However, designing effective Lagrangian traffic control policies for AVs that generalize across traffic scenarios introduces a major challenge. Real-world traffic environments are highly diverse, and developing policies that perform robustly across such diverse traffic scenarios is challenging. It is further compounded by the joint complexity of the multi-agent nature of traffic systems, mixed motives among participants, and conflicting optimization objectives subject to strict physical and external constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Residual Mixture of Expert Learning (MRMEL), a novel framework for Lagrangian traffic control that augments a given suboptimal nominal policy with a learned residual while explicitly accounting for the structure of the traffic scenario space. In particular, taking inspiration from residual reinforcement learning, MRMEL augments a suboptimal nominal AV control policy by learning a residual correction, but at the same time dynamically selects the most suitable nominal policy from a pool of nominal policies conditioned on the traffic scenarios and modeled as a mixture of experts. We validate MRMEL using a case study in cooperative eco-driving at signalized intersections in Atlanta, Dallas Fort Worth, and Salt Lake City, with real-world data-driven traffic scenarios. The results show that MRMEL consistently yields superior performance-achieving an additional 4%-9% reduction in aggregate vehicle emissions relative to the strongest baseline in each setting.

<title>A Pre-training Framework for Relational Data with Information-theoretic Principles</title>

Abstract: Relational databases underpin critical infrastructure across a wide range of domains, yet the design of generalizable pre-training strategies for learning from relational databases remains an open challenge due to task heterogeneity. Specifically, there exist infinitely many possible downstream tasks, as tasks are defined based on relational schema graphs, temporal dependencies, and SQL-defined label logics. An effective pre-training framework is desired to take these factors into account in order to obtain task-aware representations. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying distribution that drives label generation, downstream tasks can benefit from relevant side-channel information. To bridge this gap, we introduce Task Vector Estimation (TVE), a novel pre-training framework that constructs predictive supervisory signals via set-based aggregation over schema traversal graphs, explicitly modeling next-window relational dynamics. We formalize our approach through an information-theoretic lens, demonstrating that task-informed representations retain more relevant signals than those obtained without task priors. Extensive experiments on the RelBench benchmark show that TVE consistently outperforms traditional pre-training baselines. Our findings advocate for pre-training objectives that encode task heterogeneity and temporal structure as design principles for predictive modeling on relational databases.

<title>Through the River: Understanding the Benefit of Schedule-Free Methods for Language Model Training</title>

Abstract: As both model and dataset sizes continue to scale rapidly, conventional pretraining strategies with fixed compute budgets-such as cosine learning rate schedules-are increasingly inadequate for large-scale training. Recent alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024], which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the "river" structure of the loss landscape without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model training.

<title>Secure and Efficient UAV-Based Face Detection via Homomorphic Encryption and Edge Computing</title>

Abstract: This paper aims to propose a novel machine learning (ML) approach incorporating Homomorphic Encryption (HE) to address privacy limitations in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)-based face detection. Due to challenges related to distance, altitude, and face orientation, high-resolution imagery and sophisticated neural networks enable accurate face recognition in dynamic environments. However, privacy concerns arise from the extensive surveillance capabilities of UAVs. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates HE with advanced neural networks to secure facial data throughout the inference phase. This method ensures that facial data remains secure with minimal impact on detection accuracy. Specifically, the proposed system leverages the Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme to perform computations directly on encrypted data, optimizing computational efficiency and security. Furthermore, we develop an effective data encoding method specifically designed to preprocess the raw facial data into CKKS form in a Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data (SIMD) manner. Building on this, we design a secure inference algorithm to compute on ciphertext without needing decryption. This approach not only protects data privacy during the processing of facial data but also enhances the efficiency of UAV-based face detection systems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively balances privacy protection and detection performance, making it a viable solution for UAV-based secure face detection. Significantly, our approach (while maintaining data confidentially with HE encryption) can still achieve an accuracy of less than 1% compared to the benchmark without using encryption.

Abstract: Visually-Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field, driven by the need to automatically process documents containing complex visual, textual, and layout information. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in this domain, leveraging both Optical Character Recognition (OCR)-dependent and OCR-free frameworks to extract and interpret information in document images. This survey reviews recent advancements in MLLM-based VRDU, highlighting three core components: (1) methods for encoding and fusing textual, visual, and layout features; (2) training paradigms, including pretraining strategies, instruction-response tuning, and the trainability of different model modules; and (3) datasets utilized for pretraining, instruction-tuning, and supervised fine-tuning. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities in this evolving field and propose future directions to advance the efficiency, generalizability, and robustness of VRDU systems.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a structured and interpretable alternative to Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based RL methods, with lower computational complexity and greater transparency. However, standard MPC-RL approaches often suffer from slow convergence, suboptimal policy learning due to limited parameterization, and safety issues during online adaptation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates MPC-RL with Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO). The proposed MPC-RL-MOBO utilizes noisy evaluations of the RL stage cost and its gradient, estimated via a Compatible Deterministic Policy Gradient (CDPG) approach, and incorporates them into a MOBO algorithm using the Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) acquisition function. This fusion enables efficient and safe tuning of the MPC parameters to achieve improved closed-loop performance, even under model imperfections. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving sample-efficient, stable, and high-performance learning for control systems.

Abstract: Code large language models (LLMs) enhance programming by understanding and generating code across languages, offering intelligent feedback, bug detection, and code updates through reflection, improving development efficiency and accessibility. While benchmarks (e.g. HumanEval/LiveCodeBench) evaluate code generation and real-world relevance, previous works ignore the scenario of modifying code in repositories. Considering challenges remaining in improving reflection capabilities and avoiding data contamination in dynamic benchmarks, we introduce LiveRepoReflection, a challenging benchmark for evaluating code understanding and generation in multi-file repository contexts, featuring 1,888 rigorously filtered test cases across $6$ programming languages to ensure diversity, correctness, and high difficulty. Further, we create RepoReflection-Instruct, a large-scale, quality-filtered instruction-tuning dataset derived from diverse sources, used to train RepoReflectionCoder through a two-turn dialogue process involving code generation and error-driven repair. The leaderboard evaluates over 40 LLMs to reflect the model performance of repository-based code reflection.

Abstract: The grand goal of AI research, and particularly Self Supervised Learning (SSL), is to produce systems that can successfully solve any possible task. In contrast, current evaluation methods available to AI researchers typically rely on a fixed collection of hand-picked downstream benchmarks. Hence, a large amount of effort is put into designing and searching for large collection of evaluation tasks that can serve as a proxy of our grand goal. We argue that such a rigid evaluation protocol creates a silent bottleneck in AI research. To remedy that, we define a probabilistic space of downstream tasks obtained by adopting a distribution of tasks and by defining Task Priors. Under this view, one can evaluate a model's performance over the set of all possible downstream tasks. Our framework is the first to provide answers to key questions such as (i) what is the average performance of my model over all possible downstream tasks weighted by the probability to encounter each task? or (ii) what is the variance of my model's performance across all downstream tasks under the defined Task Priors? Beyond establishing a new standard for evaluation, we believe that Task Priors will accelerate the pace of research in SSL - where downstream task evaluation is the sole qualitative signal that researchers have access to.

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate the intriguing ability to perform unseen tasks via in-context learning. However, it remains unclear what mechanisms inside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we approach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3, 2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function as a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as path patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their notable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a function induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from standard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the structure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it to a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1 function is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which emits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function induction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic tasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8 addition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and composable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.

Abstract: Video understanding plays a vital role in bridging low-level visual signals with high-level cognitive reasoning, and is fundamental to applications such as autonomous driving, embodied AI, and the broader pursuit of AGI. The rapid development of large language models (LLMs), particularly those utilizing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technology, has significantly advanced video reasoning capabilities. However, current approaches primarily depend on textual information for reasoning, overlooking the visual modality in the actual video reasoning process. In contrast, humans naturally re-examine visual content while reasoning. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel video reasoning paradigm: Video-Text Interleaved CoT (ViTCoT), which facilitates more intuitive and cognitively aligned reasoning. To the end, first, we construct the Video-Text Interleaved Benchmark (ViTIB), which is created using MLLMs for key-video selection and manually verified. Furthermore, we extensively explore the potential of the ViTCoT paradigm in the video understanding field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViTCoT significantly enhances performance compared to the traditional text-only CoT paradigm and effectively activates more neuron values in MLLMs.

Abstract: We consider the problem of covering multiple submodular constraints. Given a finite ground set $N$, a cost function $c: N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, $r$ monotone submodular functions $f_1,f_2,\ldots,f_r$ over $N$ and requirements $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_r$ the goal is to find a minimum cost subset $S \subseteq N$ such that $f_i(S) \ge b_i$ for $1 \le i \le r$. When $r=1$ this is the well-known Submodular Set Cover problem. Previous work \cite{chekuri2022covering} considered the setting when $r$ is large and developed bi-criteria approximation algorithms, and approximation algorithms for the important special case when each $f_i$ is a weighted coverage function. These are fairly general models and capture several concrete and interesting problems as special cases. The approximation ratios for these problem are at least $\Omega(\log r)$ which is unavoidable when $r$ is part of the input. In this paper, motivated by some recent applications, we consider the problem when $r$ is a \emph{fixed constant} and obtain two main results. For covering multiple submodular constraints we obtain a randomized bi-criteria approximation algorithm that for any given integer $\alpha \ge 1$ outputs a set $S$ such that $f_i(S) \ge$ $(1-1/e^\alpha -\epsilon)b_i$ for each $i \in [r]$ and $\mathbb{E}[c(S)] \le (1+\epsilon)\alpha \cdot \sf{OPT}$. Second, when the $f_i$ are weighted coverage functions from a deletion-closed set system we obtain a $(1+\epsilon)$ $(\frac{e}{e-1})$ $(1+\beta)$-approximation where $\beta$ is the approximation ratio for the underlying set cover instances via the natural LP. These results show that one can obtain nearly as good an approximation for any fixed $r$ as what one would achieve for $r=1$. We mention some applications that follow easily from these general results and anticipate more in the future.

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an essential and effective tool for diagnosing heart diseases. However, its effectiveness can be compromised by noise or unavailability of one or more leads of the standard 12-lead recordings, resulting in diagnostic errors or uncertainty. To address these challenges, we propose TolerantECG, a foundation model for ECG signals that is robust to noise and capable of functioning with arbitrary subsets of the standard 12-lead ECG. TolerantECG training combines contrastive and self-supervised learning frameworks to jointly learn ECG signal representations alongside their corresponding knowledge-retrieval-based text report descriptions and corrupted or lead-missing signals. Comprehensive benchmarking results demonstrate that TolerantECG consistently ranks as the best or second-best performer across various ECG signal conditions and class levels in the PTB-XL dataset, and achieves the highest performance on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.

<title>NeuTSFlow: Modeling Continuous Functions Behind Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time series forecasting is a fundamental task with broad applications, yet conventional methods often treat data as discrete sequences, overlooking their origin as noisy samples of continuous processes. Crucially, discrete noisy observations cannot uniquely determine a continuous function; instead, they correspond to a family of plausible functions. Mathematically, time series can be viewed as noisy observations of a continuous function family governed by a shared probability measure. Thus, the forecasting task can be framed as learning the transition from the historical function family to the future function family. This reframing introduces two key challenges: (1) How can we leverage discrete historical and future observations to learn the relationships between their underlying continuous functions? (2) How can we model the transition path in function space from the historical function family to the future function family? To address these challenges, we propose NeuTSFlow, a novel framework that leverages Neural Operators to facilitate flow matching for learning path of measure between historical and future function families. By parameterizing the velocity field of the flow in infinite-dimensional function spaces, NeuTSFlow moves beyond traditional methods that focus on dependencies at discrete points, directly modeling function-level features instead. Experiments on diverse forecasting tasks demonstrate NeuTSFlow's superior accuracy and robustness, validating the effectiveness of the function-family perspective.

Abstract: Clustering analysis is fundamental in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis for elucidating cellular heterogeneity and diversity. Recent graph-based scRNA-seq clustering methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have significantly improved in tackling the challenges of high-dimension, high-sparsity, and frequent dropout events that lead to ambiguous cell population boundaries. However, their reliance on hard graph constructions derived from thresholded similarity matrices presents challenges:(i) The simplification of intercellular relationships into binary edges (0 or 1) by applying thresholds, which restricts the capture of continuous similarity features among cells and leads to significant information loss.(ii) The presence of significant inter-cluster connections within hard graphs, which can confuse GNN methods that rely heavily on graph structures, potentially causing erroneous message propagation and biased clustering outcomes. To tackle these challenges, we introduce scSGC, a Soft Graph Clustering for single-cell RNA sequencing data, which aims to more accurately characterize continuous similarities among cells through non-binary edge weights, thereby mitigating the limitations of rigid data structures. The scSGC framework comprises three core components: (i) a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB)-based feature autoencoder; (ii) a dual-channel cut-informed soft graph embedding module; and (iii) an optimal transport-based clustering optimization module. Extensive experiments across ten datasets demonstrate that scSGC outperforms 13 state-of-the-art clustering models in clustering accuracy, cell type annotation, and computational efficiency. These results highlight its substantial potential to advance scRNA-seq data analysis and deepen our understanding of cellular heterogeneity.

Abstract: Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice. Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of U-Net architectures integrated with various convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones for automated lung cancer detection and segmentation in chest CT images, addressing the critical need for accurate diagnostic tools in clinical settings. A balanced dataset of 832 chest CT images (416 cancerous and 416 non-cancerous) was preprocessed using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and resized to 128x128 pixels. U-Net models were developed with three CNN backbones: ResNet50, VGG16, and Xception, to segment lung regions. After segmentation, CNN-based classifiers and hybrid models combining CNN feature extraction with traditional machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting) were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Metrics included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Dice coefficient, and ROC-AUC. U-Net with ResNet50 achieved the best performance for cancerous lungs (Dice: 0.9495, Accuracy: 0.9735), while U-Net with VGG16 performed best for non-cancerous segmentation (Dice: 0.9532, Accuracy: 0.9513). For classification, the CNN model using U-Net with Xception achieved 99.1 percent accuracy, 99.74 percent recall, and 99.42 percent F1-score. The hybrid CNN-SVM-Xception model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy and 97.88 percent F1-score. Compared to prior methods, our framework consistently outperformed existing models. In conclusion, combining U-Net with advanced CNN backbones provides a powerful method for both segmentation and classification of lung cancer in CT scans, supporting early diagnosis and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Many of society's most pressing challenges, from pandemic response to supply chain disruptions to climate adaptation, emerge from the collective behavior of millions of autonomous agents making decisions over time. Large Population Models (LPMs) offer an approach to understand these complex systems by simulating entire populations with realistic behaviors and interactions at unprecedented scale. LPMs extend traditional modeling approaches through three key innovations: computational methods that efficiently simulate millions of agents simultaneously, mathematical frameworks that learn from diverse real-world data streams, and privacy-preserving communication protocols that bridge virtual and physical environments. This allows researchers to observe how agent behavior aggregates into system-level outcomes and test interventions before real-world implementation. While current AI advances primarily focus on creating "digital humans" with sophisticated individual capabilities, LPMs develop "digital societies" where the richness of interactions reveals emergent phenomena. By bridging individual agent behavior and population-scale dynamics, LPMs offer a complementary path in AI research illuminating collective intelligence and providing testing grounds for policies and social innovations before real-world deployment. We discuss the technical foundations and some open problems here. LPMs are implemented by the AgentTorch framework (github.com/AgentTorch/AgentTorch)

Abstract: Continually updating model-based indexes in generative retrieval with new documents remains challenging, as full retraining is computationally expensive and impractical under resource constraints. We propose MixLoRA-DSI, a novel framework that combines an expandable mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation experts with a layer-wise out-of-distribution (OOD)-driven expansion strategy. Instead of allocating new experts for each new corpus, our proposed expansion strategy enables sublinear parameter growth by selectively introducing new experts only when significant number of OOD documents are detected. Experiments on NQ320k and MS MARCO Passage demonstrate that MixLoRA-DSI outperforms full-model update baselines, with minimal parameter overhead and substantially lower training costs.

Abstract: This work investigates speech enhancement (SE) from the perspective of language models (LMs). We propose a novel method that leverages Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the perceptual quality of enhanced speech. Using UTMOS, a neural MOS prediction model, as a proxy for human ratings, our approach guides optimization toward perceptually preferred outputs. This differs from existing LM-based SE methods that focus on maximizing the likelihood of clean speech tokens, which may misalign with human perception and degrade quality despite low prediction error. Experiments on the 2020 Deep Noise Suppression Challenge test sets demonstrate that applying DPO to a pretrained LM-based SE model yields consistent improvements across various speech quality metrics, with relative gains of up to 56%. To our knowledge, this is the first application of DPO to SE and the first to incorporate proxy perceptual feedback into LM-based SE training, pointing to a promising direction for perceptually aligned SE.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into safety-critical domains, such as nuclear engineering, necessitates a deep understanding of their internal reasoning processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for interpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a Boiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM (Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation patterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a sparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the adaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we employed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while silencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a statistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively led to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative analysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's ability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This paper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an opaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable neural circuits. This offers a pathway towards achieving nuclear-grade artificial intelligence (AI) assurance, addressing the verification and validation challenges mandated by nuclear regulatory frameworks (e.g., 10 CFR 50 Appendix B), which have limited AI deployment in safety-critical nuclear operations.

<title>Enhancing Retrieval Augmented Generation with Hierarchical Text Segmentation Chunking</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems commonly use chunking strategies for retrieval, which enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to access external knowledge, ensuring that the retrieved information is up-to-date and domain-specific. However, traditional methods often fail to create chunks that capture sufficient semantic meaning, as they do not account for the underlying textual structure. This paper proposes a novel framework that enhances RAG by integrating hierarchical text segmentation and clustering to generate more meaningful and semantically coherent chunks. During inference, the framework retrieves information by leveraging both segment-level and cluster-level vector representations, thereby increasing the likelihood of retrieving more precise and contextually relevant information. Evaluations on the NarrativeQA, QuALITY, and QASPER datasets indicate that the proposed method achieved improved results compared to traditional chunking techniques.

Abstract: Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences, posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is achievable. We open-source our code at http://github.com/grghosal/MemSinks.

Abstract: The fashion retail business is centered around the capacity to comprehend products. Product attribution helps in comprehending products depending on the business process. Quality attribution improves the customer experience as they navigate through millions of products offered by a retail website. It leads to well-organized product catalogs. In the end, product attribution directly impacts the 'discovery experience' of the customer. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in understanding multimodal data, their performance on fine-grained fashion attribute recognition remains under-explored. This paper presents a zero-shot evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs that balance performance with speed and cost efficiency, mainly GPT-4o-mini and Gemini 2.0 Flash. We have used the dataset DeepFashion-MultiModal (https://github.com/yumingj/DeepFashion-MultiModal) to evaluate these models in the attribution tasks of fashion products. Our study evaluates these models across 18 categories of fashion attributes, offering insight into where these models excel. We only use images as the sole input for product information to create a constrained environment. Our analysis shows that Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrates the strongest overall performance with a macro F1 score of 56.79% across all attributes, while GPT-4o-mini scored a macro F1 score of 43.28%. Through detailed error analysis, our findings provide practical insights for deploying these LLMs in production e-commerce product attribution-related tasks and highlight the need for domain-specific fine-tuning approaches. This work also lays the groundwork for future research in fashion AI and multimodal attribute extraction.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information, facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms: 3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of 0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor (ET) region.

Abstract: Large decoder-based language models have become the dominant architecture for reward modeling in reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, as reward models are increasingly deployed in test-time strategies, their inference costs become a growing concern. We present TinyRM, a family of small, bidirectional masked language models (MLMs) with as few as 400 million parameters, that rival the capabilities of models over 175 times larger on reasoning and safety preference modeling tasks. TinyRM combines FLAN-style prompting, Directional Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA), and layer freezing to achieve strong performance on RewardBench, despite using significantly fewer resources. Our experiments suggest that small models benefit from domain-specific tuning strategies, particularly in reasoning, where lightweight finetuning methods are especially effective. While challenges remain in building generalist models and conversational preference modeling, our preliminary results highlight the promise of lightweight bidirectional architectures as efficient, scalable alternatives for preference modeling.

Abstract: Touch is recognized as a vital sense for humans and an equally important modality for robots, especially for dexterous manipulation, material identification, and scenarios involving visual occlusion. Building upon very recent work in touch foundation models, this demonstration will feature Octopi-1.5, our latest visual-tactile-language model. Compared to its predecessor, Octopi-1.5 introduces the ability to process tactile signals from multiple object parts and employs a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module to improve performance on tasks and potentially learn new objects on-the-fly. The system can be experienced live through a new handheld tactile-enabled interface, the TMI, equipped with GelSight and TAC-02 tactile sensors. This convenient and accessible setup allows users to interact with Octopi-1.5 without requiring a robot. During the demonstration, we will showcase Octopi-1.5 solving tactile inference tasks by leveraging tactile inputs and commonsense knowledge. For example, in a Guessing Game, Octopi-1.5 will identify objects being grasped and respond to follow-up queries about how to handle it (e.g., recommending careful handling for soft fruits). We also plan to demonstrate Octopi-1.5's RAG capabilities by teaching it new items. With live interactions, this demonstration aims to highlight both the progress and limitations of VTLMs such as Octopi-1.5 and to foster further interest in this exciting field. Code for Octopi-1.5 and design files for the TMI gripper are available at https://github.com/clear-nus/octopi-1.5.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically require fine-tuning for domain-specific tasks, and LoRA offers a computationally efficient approach by training low-rank adapters. LoRA is also communication-efficient for federated LLMs when multiple users collaboratively fine-tune a global LLM model without sharing their proprietary raw data. However, even the transmission of local adapters between a server and clients risks serious privacy leakage. Applying differential privacy (DP) to federated LoRA encounters a dilemma: adding noise to both adapters amplifies synthetic noise on the model, while fixing one adapter impairs the learnability of fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose FedASK (Differentially Private Federated Low Rank Adaptation with Double Sketching) , a novel federated LoRA framework to enable effective updating of both low-rank adapters with robust differential privacy. Inspired by randomized SVD, our key idea is a two-stage sketching pipeline. This pipeline first aggregates carefully sketched, privacy-preserving local updates, and then reconstructs the global matrices on the server to facilitate effective updating of both adapters. We theoretically prove FedASK's differential privacy guarantee and its exact aggregation property. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FedASK consistently outperforms baseline methods across a variety of privacy settings and data distributions.

Abstract: Fear is a critical brain function for detecting danger and learning to avoid specific stimuli that can lead to danger. While fear is believed to have evolved under pressure from predators, experimentally reproducing the evolution is challenging. To investigate the relationship between environmental conditions, the evolution of fear, and the evolution of other rewards, such as food reward and social reward, we developed a distributed evolutionary simulation. In our simulation, prey and predator agents co-evolve their innate reward functions, including a possibly fear-like term for observing predators, and learn behaviors via reinforcement learning. Surprisingly, our simulation revealed that social reward for observing the same species is more important for prey to survive, and fear-like negative reward for observing predators evolves only after acquiring social reward. We also found that the predator with increased hunting ability (larger mouth) amplified fear emergence, but also that fear evolution is more stable with non-evolving predators that are bad at chasing prey. Additionally, unlike for predators, we found that positive rewards evolve in opposition to fear for stationary threats, as areas with abundant leftover food develop around them. These findings suggest that fear and social reward have had a complex interplay with each other through evolution, along with the nature of predators and threats.

Abstract: Foundation multi-modal models are often designed by stitching of multiple existing pretrained uni-modal models: for example, an image classifier with an autoregressive text model. This stitching process is performed by training a connector module that aims to align the representation-representation or representation-input spaces of these uni-modal models. However, given the complexity of training such connectors on large scale web-based datasets coupled with the ever-increasing number of available pretrained uni-modal models, the task of uni-modal models selection and subsequent connector module training becomes computationally demanding. To address this under-studied critical problem, we propose Hypernetwork Model Alignment (Hyma), a novel all-in-one solution for optimal uni-modal model selection and connector training by leveraging hypernetworks. Specifically, our framework utilizes the parameter prediction capability of a hypernetwork to obtain jointly trained connector modules for $N \times M$ combinations of uni-modal models. In our experiments, Hyma reduces the optimal uni-modal model pair search cost by $10\times$ (averaged across all experiments), while matching the ranking and trained connector performance obtained via grid search across a suite of diverse multi-modal benchmarks.

Abstract: Poultry farming is a vital component of the global food supply chain, yet it remains highly vulnerable to infectious diseases such as coccidiosis, salmonellosis, and Newcastle disease. This study proposes a lightweight machine learning-based approach to detect these diseases by analyzing poultry fecal images. We utilize multi-color space feature extraction (RGB, HSV, LAB) and explore a wide range of color, texture, and shape-based descriptors, including color histograms, local binary patterns (LBP), wavelet transforms, and edge detectors. Through a systematic ablation study and dimensionality reduction using PCA and XGBoost feature selection, we identify a compact global feature set that balances accuracy and computational efficiency. An artificial neural network (ANN) classifier trained on these features achieved 95.85% accuracy while requiring no GPU and only 638 seconds of execution time in Google Colab. Compared to deep learning models such as Xception and MobileNetV3, our proposed model offers comparable accuracy with drastically lower resource usage. This work demonstrates a cost-effective, interpretable, and scalable alternative to deep learning for real-time poultry disease detection in low-resource agricultural settings.

<title>PRISM: Fine-Grained Paper-to-Paper Retrieval with Multi-Aspect-Aware Query Optimization</title>

Abstract: Scientific paper retrieval, particularly framed as document-to-document retrieval, aims to identify relevant papers in response to a long-form query paper, rather than a short query string. Previous approaches to this task have focused on abstracts, embedding them into dense vectors as surrogates for full documents and calculating similarity across them, although abstracts provide only sparse and high-level summaries. To address this, we propose PRISM, a novel document-to-document retrieval method that introduces multiple, fine-grained representations for both the query and candidate papers. In particular, each query paper is decomposed into multiple aspect-specific views and individually embedded, which are then matched against candidate papers similarity segmented to consider their multifaceted dimensions. Moreover, we present SciFullBench, a novel benchmark in which the complete and segmented context of full papers for both queries and candidates is available. Then, experimental results show that PRISM improves performance by an average of 4.3% over existing retrieval baselines.

<title>Cultural Bias in Large Language Models: Evaluating AI Agents through Moral Questionnaires</title>

Abstract: Are AI systems truly representing human values, or merely averaging across them? Our study suggests a concerning reality: Large Language Models (LLMs) fail to represent diverse cultural moral frameworks despite their linguistic capabilities. We expose significant gaps between AI-generated and human moral intuitions by applying the Moral Foundations Questionnaire across 19 cultural contexts. Comparing multiple state-of-the-art LLMs' origins against human baseline data, we find these models systematically homogenize moral diversity. Surprisingly, increased model size doesn't consistently improve cultural representation fidelity. Our findings challenge the growing use of LLMs as synthetic populations in social science research and highlight a fundamental limitation in current AI alignment approaches. Without data-driven alignment beyond prompting, these systems cannot capture the nuanced, culturally-specific moral intuitions. Our results call for more grounded alignment objectives and evaluation metrics to ensure AI systems represent diverse human values rather than flattening the moral landscape.

<title>TGLD: A Trust-Aware Game-Theoretic Lane-Changing Decision Framework for Automated Vehicles in Heterogeneous Traffic</title>

Abstract: Automated vehicles (AVs) face a critical need to adopt socially compatible behaviors and cooperate effectively with human-driven vehicles (HVs) in heterogeneous traffic environment. However, most existing lane-changing frameworks overlook HVs' dynamic trust levels, limiting their ability to accurately predict human driver behaviors. To address this gap, this study proposes a trust-aware game-theoretic lane-changing decision (TGLD) framework. First, we formulate a multi-vehicle coalition game, incorporating fully cooperative interactions among AVs and partially cooperative behaviors from HVs informed by real-time trust evaluations. Second, we develop an online trust evaluation method to dynamically estimate HVs' trust levels during lane-changing interactions, guiding AVs to select context-appropriate cooperative maneuvers. Lastly, social compatibility objectives are considered by minimizing disruption to surrounding vehicles and enhancing the predictability of AV behaviors, thereby ensuring human-friendly and context-adaptive lane-changing strategies. A human-in-the-loop experiment conducted in a highway on-ramp merging scenario validates our TGLD approach. Results show that AVs can effectively adjust strategies according to different HVs' trust levels and driving styles. Moreover, incorporating a trust mechanism significantly improves lane-changing efficiency, maintains safety, and contributes to transparent and adaptive AV-HV interactions.

<title>Enhancing Chain-of-Thought Reasoning with Critical Representation Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT), a recently proposed Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, has attracted widespread attention for significantly improving parameter efficiency by editing representation space alone. In this work, we investigate applying ReFT to complex reasoning tasks. However, directly using the native ReFT method, which modifies fixed representations at the beginning and end of each layer, yields suboptimal performance, as these fixed-position representations have uncertain impact on the outputs. We observe that, in complex reasoning tasks, there often exist certain critical representations. These representations either integrate significant information from preceding layers or regulate subsequent layer representations. Through layer-by-layer propagation, they exert a substantial influence on the final output. Naturally, fine-tuning these critical representations has the potential to greatly enhance reasoning performance. Building upon these insights, we propose Critical Representation Fine-Tuning (CRFT), a novel method that identifies and optimizes these critical representations through information flow analysis. CRFT operates within a supervised learning framework, dynamically optimizing critical representations in a low-rank linear subspace while freezing the base model. The effectiveness and efficiency of our method are validated across eight benchmarks for arithmetic and commonsense reasoning, using LLaMA and Mistral model families. Furthermore, our method also adapts effectively to few-shot settings, boosting one-shot accuracy by 16.4%. Our work highlights the untapped potential of representation-level optimization for CoT reasoning, offering a lightweight yet powerful alternative to traditional PEFT methods.

<title>A Variance-Reduced Cubic-Regularized Newton for Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a second-order approach to policy optimization in reinforcement learning. Existing second-order methods often suffer from suboptimal sample complexity or rely on unrealistic assumptions about importance sampling. To overcome these limitations, we propose VR-CR-PN, a variance-reduced cubic-regularized policy Newton algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that integrates Hessian-aided variance reduction with second-order policy optimization, effectively addressing the distribution shift problem and achieving best-known sample complexity under general nonconvex conditions but without the need for importance sampling. We theoretically establish that VR-CR-PN achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-second-order stationary point, significantly improving upon the previous best result of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3.5})$ under comparable assumptions. As an additional contribution, we introduce a novel Hessian estimator for the expected return function, which admits a uniform upper bound independent of the horizon length $H$, allowing the algorithm to achieve horizon-independent sample complexity.

<title>Taming Modern Point Tracking for Speckle Tracking Echocardiography via Impartial Motion</title>

Abstract: Accurate motion estimation for tracking deformable tissues in echocardiography is essential for precise cardiac function measurements. While traditional methods like block matching or optical flow struggle with intricate cardiac motion, modern point tracking approaches remain largely underexplored in this domain. This work investigates the potential of state-of-the-art (SOTA) point tracking methods for ultrasound, with a focus on echocardiography. Although these novel approaches demonstrate strong performance in general videos, their effectiveness and generalizability in echocardiography remain limited. By analyzing cardiac motion throughout the heart cycle in real B-mode ultrasound videos, we identify that a directional motion bias across different views is affecting the existing training strategies. To mitigate this, we refine the training procedure and incorporate a set of tailored augmentations to reduce the bias and enhance tracking robustness and generalization through impartial cardiac motion. We also propose a lightweight network leveraging multi-scale cost volumes from spatial context alone to challenge the advanced spatiotemporal point tracking models. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning with our strategies significantly improves models' performances over their baselines, even for out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. For instance, EchoTracker boosts overall position accuracy by 60.7% and reduces median trajectory error by 61.5% across heart cycle phases. Interestingly, several point tracking models fail to outperform our proposed simple model in terms of tracking accuracy and generalization, reflecting their limitations when applied to echocardiography. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation reveals that these methods improve GLS measurements, aligning more closely with expert-validated, semi-automated tools and thus demonstrating better reproducibility in real-world applications.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of energy demand and supply is critical for optimizing sustainable energy systems, yet it is challenged by the variability of renewable sources and dynamic consumption patterns. This paper introduces a neural framework that integrates continuous-time Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), graph attention, multi-resolution wavelet transformations, and adaptive learning of frequencies to address the issues of time series prediction. The model employs a robust ODE solver, using the Runge-Kutta method, paired with graph-based attention and residual connections to better understand both structural and temporal patterns. Through wavelet-based feature extraction and adaptive frequency modulation, it adeptly captures and models diverse, multi-scale temporal dynamics. When evaluated across seven diverse datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2 (electricity transformer temperature), and Waste, Solar, and Hydro (renewable energy), this architecture consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various forecasting metrics, proving its robustness in capturing complex temporal dependencies. Furthermore, the model enhances interpretability through SHAP analysis, making it suitable for sustainable energy applications.

<title>Extending Defeasibility for Propositional Standpoint Logics</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new defeasible version of propositional standpoint logic by integrating Kraus et al.'s defeasible conditionals, Britz and Varzinczak's notions of defeasible necessity and distinct possibility, along with Leisegang et al.'s approach to defeasibility into the standpoint logics of G\'omez \'Alvarez and Rudolph. The resulting logical framework allows for the expression of defeasibility on the level of implications, standpoint modal operators, and standpoint-sharpening statements. We provide a preferential semantics for this extended language and propose a tableaux calculus, which is shown to be sound and complete with respect to preferential entailment. We also establish the computational complexity of the tableaux procedure to be in PSpace.

Abstract: Innate resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy remains a major clinical challenge in metastatic melanoma, with the underlying molecular networks being poorly understood. To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ``hit-and-run" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.

<title>Play Style Identification Using Low-Level Representations of Play Traces in MicroRTS</title>

Abstract: Play style identification can provide valuable game design insights and enable adaptive experiences, with the potential to improve game playing agents. Previous work relies on domain knowledge to construct play trace representations using handcrafted features. More recent approaches incorporate the sequential structure of play traces but still require some level of domain abstraction. In this study, we explore the use of unsupervised CNN-LSTM autoencoder models to obtain latent representations directly from low-level play trace data in MicroRTS. We demonstrate that this approach yields a meaningful separation of different game playing agents in the latent space, reducing reliance on domain expertise and its associated biases. This latent space is then used to guide the exploration of diverse play styles within studied AI players.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in natural language processing tasks, their effectiveness in the classification and transformation of abusive text into non-abusive versions remains an area for exploration. In this study, we aim to use LLMs to transform abusive text (tweets and reviews) featuring hate speech and swear words into non-abusive text, while retaining the intent of the text. We evaluate the performance of two state-of-the-art LLMs, such as Gemini, GPT-4o, DeekSeek and Groq, on their ability to identify abusive text. We them to transform and obtain a text that is clean from abusive and inappropriate content but maintains a similar level of sentiment and semantics, i.e. the transformed text needs to maintain its message. Afterwards, we evaluate the raw and transformed datasets with sentiment analysis and semantic analysis. Our results show Groq provides vastly different results when compared with other LLMs. We have identified similarities between GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3.

Abstract: We identify a second machine turn in the process of mathematical discovery: after automating proof-checking, AI is now poised to automate the *creation* of mathematical concepts themselves. We discuss the current state of the art, obstacles and potential solutions as well as a preliminary attempt at mathematizing the creation of concepts itself. The paper ends with an assessment of how these capabilities could reshape mathematics and human-machine collaboration, and a few different futures we might find ourselves in.

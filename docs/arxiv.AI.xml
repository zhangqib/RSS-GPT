<div> Keywords: imitation learning, teleoperation, force feedback, bilateral control, manipulator dynamics

Summary:
This study focuses on enhancing teleoperation capabilities for low-cost manipulators by incorporating force feedback using 4-channel bilateral control. Traditional unilateral control systems that only transmit target position values are limited in fast or contact-rich tasks due to the lack of force feedback. The proposed method compensates for nonlinearities, estimates velocity and external forces, and adjusts gain based on inertial variations to enable fast teleoperation with force feedback. By integrating force information into both input and output of learned policies, the system shows improved performance in imitation learning. The research demonstrates the feasibility of achieving high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware through the use of 4-channel bilateral control.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.

Abstract: Visual and semantic concepts are often structured in a hierarchical manner. For instance, textual concept `cat' entails all images of cats. A recent study, MERU, successfully adapts multimodal learning techniques from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, effectively capturing the visual-semantic hierarchy. However, a critical question remains: how can we more efficiently train a model to capture and leverage this hierarchy? In this paper, we propose the Hyperbolic Masked Image and Distillation Network (HMID-Net), a novel and efficient method that integrates Masked Image Modeling (MIM) and knowledge distillation techniques within hyperbolic space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to leverage MIM and knowledge distillation in hyperbolic space to train highly efficient models. In addition, we introduce a distillation loss function specifically designed to facilitate effective knowledge transfer in hyperbolic space. Our experiments demonstrate that MIM and knowledge distillation techniques in hyperbolic space can achieve the same remarkable success as in Euclidean space. Extensive evaluations show that our method excels across a wide range of downstream tasks, significantly outperforming existing models like MERU and CLIP in both image classification and retrieval.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene. Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance, achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5 of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods, our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

Summary:
The article introduces RoMaP, a novel framework for local 3D Gaussian editing. It addresses challenges in achieving precise local 3D edits by introducing a robust 3D mask generation module called 3D-GALP, which provides accurate and consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. RoMaP also proposes a regularized SDS loss that combines standard SDS loss with additional regularizers, such as L1 anchor loss through SLaMP editing method and Gaussian prior removal. These enhancements enable precise and drastic part-level modifications while ensuring contextual coherence and preventing unintended edits. Experimental results demonstrate that RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local 3D editing on reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects, showcasing its robustness and flexibility in part-level 3D Gaussian editing. <div>
arXiv:2507.11061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D neural representations and instance-level editing models have enabled the efficient creation of high-quality 3D content. However, achieving precise local 3D edits remains challenging, especially for Gaussian Splatting, due to inconsistent multi-view 2D part segmentations and inherently ambiguous nature of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. To address these limitations, we propose RoMaP, a novel local 3D Gaussian editing framework that enables precise and drastic part-level modifications. First, we introduce a robust 3D mask generation module with our 3D-Geometry Aware Label Prediction (3D-GALP), which uses spherical harmonics (SH) coefficients to model view-dependent label variations and soft-label property, yielding accurate and consistent part segmentations across viewpoints. Second, we propose a regularized SDS loss that combines the standard SDS loss with additional regularizers. In particular, an L1 anchor loss is introduced via our Scheduled Latent Mixing and Part (SLaMP) editing method, which generates high-quality part-edited 2D images and confines modifications only to the target region while preserving contextual coherence. Additional regularizers, such as Gaussian prior removal, further improve flexibility by allowing changes beyond the existing context, and robust 3D masking prevents unintended edits. Experimental results demonstrate that our RoMaP achieves state-of-the-art local 3D editing on both reconstructed and generated Gaussian scenes and objects qualitatively and quantitatively, making it possible for more robust and flexible part-level 3D Gaussian editing.

<div> Keywords: Artificial General Intelligence, Adaptive spontaneity, Free will, Quantum field theory, Decision-making

Summary: This paper introduces the concept of the Free Will Equation, a theoretical framework inspired by quantum field theory to incorporate adaptive spontaneity in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) agents. The framework allows AGI agents to make unexpected decisions not purely based on past data or immediate rewards, enhancing creativity and adaptability. By treating an AI agent's cognitive state as a superposition of potential actions that probabilistically collapse into a concrete decision, similar to a quantum wavefunction collapse, the agents can explore novel strategies and adapt to changing environments. Experiments in a dynamic multi-armed bandit setting show that agents using the Free Will Equation outperform baseline methods in terms of rewards and policy diversity.<br /><br />Summary: Keywords, Introduction of Free Will Equation, Inspiration from Quantum Field Theory, Implementation in AGI agents, Benefits of adaptive spontaneity, Experimental results. <div>
arXiv:2507.14154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research traditionally focuses on algorithms that optimize for specific goals under deterministic rules. Yet, human-like intelligence exhibits adaptive spontaneity - an ability to make unexpected choices or free decisions not strictly dictated by past data or immediate reward. This trait, often dubbed "free will" in a loose sense, might be crucial for creativity, robust adaptation, and avoiding ruts in problem-solving. This paper proposes a theoretical framework, called the Free Will Equation, that draws analogies from quantum field theory to endow AGI agents with a form of adaptive, controlled stochasticity in their decision-making process. The core idea is to treat an AI agent's cognitive state as a superposition of potential actions or thoughts, which collapses probabilistically into a concrete action when a decision is made - much like a quantum wavefunction collapsing upon measurement. By incorporating mechanisms analogous to quantum fields, along with intrinsic motivation terms, we aim to improve an agent's ability to explore novel strategies and adapt to unforeseen changes. Experiments in a non-stationary multi-armed bandit environment demonstrate that agents using this framework achieve higher rewards and policy diversity compared to baseline methods.

Summary: 
The article introduces the DFT-based Research Engine for Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a multi-agent framework for high-throughput, high-fidelity materials discovery. DREAMS combines a central Large Language Model planner agent with domain-specific agents for various tasks such as structure generation, convergence testing, HPC scheduling, and error handling. Through validation on benchmark tests and the CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, DREAMS demonstrates expert-level accuracy in DFT simulations. The framework also utilizes Bayesian ensemble sampling to quantify functional-driven uncertainties. Overall, DREAMS achieves L3-level automation, reducing the need for human expertise and intervention in computational materials discovery. This approach offers a scalable and democratized path towards efficient and accurate materials exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials discovery relies on high-throughput, high-fidelity simulation techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), which require years of training, extensive parameter fine-tuning and systematic error handling. To address these challenges, we introduce the DFT-based Research Engine for Agentic Materials Screening (DREAMS), a hierarchical, multi-agent framework for DFT simulation that combines a central Large Language Model (LLM) planner agent with domain-specific LLM agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic DFT convergence testing, High-Performance Computing (HPC) scheduling, and error handling. In addition, a shared canvas helps the LLM agents to structure their discussions, preserve context and prevent hallucination. We validate DREAMS capabilities on the Sol27LC lattice-constant benchmark, achieving average errors below 1\% compared to the results of human DFT experts. Furthermore, we apply DREAMS to the long-standing CO/Pt(111) adsorption puzzle, demonstrating its long-term and complex problem-solving capabilities. The framework again reproduces expert-level literature adsorption-energy differences. Finally, DREAMS is employed to quantify functional-driven uncertainties with Bayesian ensemble sampling, confirming the Face Centered Cubic (FCC)-site preference at the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) DFT level. In conclusion, DREAMS approaches L3-level automation - autonomous exploration of a defined design space - and significantly reduces the reliance on human expertise and intervention, offering a scalable path toward democratized, high-throughput, high-fidelity computational materials discovery.

<div> Dataset, WebGuard, actions, risks, guardrails
Summary:
The article discusses the growing use of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and the risks associated with their unintended or harmful actions. To address this challenge, the researchers introduce WebGuard, a dataset focused on predicting the outcomes of web agent actions to develop guardrails for online environments. The dataset contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193 websites across various domains, classified into three risk levels: SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. Current LLMs struggle to accurately predict action outcomes, highlighting the need for dedicated safeguards. Fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard resulted in improved performance but still falls short of the reliability needed for high-stakes deployments. Enhancements in accuracy and recall were achieved, emphasizing the importance of developing robust guardrails to ensure the safe operation of autonomous web agents. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193 websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema: SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from 20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.

Abstract: Understanding complex scientific and mathematical concepts, particularly those presented in dense research papers, poses a significant challenge for learners. Dynamic visualizations can greatly enhance comprehension, but creating them manually is time-consuming and requires specialized knowledge and skills. We introduce manimator, an open-source system that leverages Large Language Models to transform research papers and natural language prompts into explanatory animations using the Manim engine. Manimator employs a pipeline where an LLM interprets the input text or research paper PDF to generate a structured scene description outlining key concepts, mathematical formulas, and visual elements and another LLM translates this description into executable Manim Python code. We discuss its potential as an educational tool for rapidly creating engaging visual explanations for complex STEM topics, democratizing the creation of high-quality educational content.

Extensive experiments on real-world ontologies show that OnT outperforms existing methods in prediction and inference tasks.

arXiv:2507.14334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OWL (Web Ontology Language) ontologies which are able to formally represent complex knowledge and support semantic reasoning have been widely adopted across various domains such as healthcare and bioinformatics. Recently, ontology embeddings have gained wide attention due to its potential to infer plausible new knowledge and approximate complex reasoning. However, existing methods face notable limitations: geometric model-based embeddings typically overlook valuable textual information, resulting in suboptimal performance, while the approaches that incorporate text, which are often based on language models, fail to preserve the logical structure. In this work, we propose a new ontology embedding method OnT, which tunes a Pretrained Language Model (PLM) via geometric modeling in a hyperbolic space for effectively incorporating textual labels and simultaneously preserving class hierarchies and other logical relationships of Description Logic EL. Extensive experiments on four real-world ontologies show that OnT consistently outperforms the baselines including the state-of-the-art across both tasks of prediction and inference of axioms. OnT also demonstrates strong potential in real-world applications, indicated by its robust transfer learning abilities and effectiveness in real cases of constructing a new ontology from SNOMED CT.

Abstract: Language models have become increasingly powerful tools for formal mathematical reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely exclusively on either large general-purpose models or smaller specialized models, each with distinct limitations, while training specialized large models still requires significant computational resources. This paper introduces ProofCompass, a novel hybrid methodology that achieves remarkable computational efficiency by strategically guiding existing specialized prover methods, such as DeepSeek-Prover-v1.5-RL (DSP-v1.5) with a Large Language Model (LLM) without requiring additional model training. The LLM provides natural language proof strategies and analyzes failed attempts to select intermediate lemmas, enabling effective problem decomposition. On the miniF2F benchmark, ProofCompass demonstrates substantial resource efficiency: it outperforms DSP-v1.5 ($54.9\% \rightarrow 55.3\%$) while using 25x fewer attempts ($3200 \rightarrow 128$). Our synergistic approach paves the way for simultaneously improving computational efficiency and accuracy in formal theorem proving.

Summary:
Nexus Architect addresses the limitations of current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) by implementing an automated workflow synthesis mechanism within the Nexus multi-agent system framework. The system autonomously generates tailored reasoning workflows based on user prompts and examples, improving generalization capabilities. Empirical evaluations on a custom dataset of logical questions show that Nexus Architect outperforms existing LRMs by up to 66% in pass rate against top models such as Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, Claude Sonnet 4, DeepSeek-R1, and Llama 4 Scout. The enhanced iteration showcases significant advancements in problem-solving efficiency and accuracy in comparison to state-of-the-art LRMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) promises a significant leap forward in language model capabilities, aiming to tackle increasingly sophisticated tasks with unprecedented efficiency and accuracy. However, despite their impressive performance, recent studies have highlighted how current reasoning models frequently fail to generalize to novel, unseen problems, often resorting to memorized solutions rather than genuine inferential reasoning. Such behavior underscores a critical limitation in modern LRMs, i.e., their tendency toward overfitting, which in turn results in poor generalization in problem-solving capabilities.
  In this paper, we introduce Nexus Architect, an enhanced iteration of our multi-agent system framework, Nexus, equipped with a novel automated workflow synthesis mechanism. Given a user's prompt and a small set of representative examples, the Architect autonomously generates a tailored reasoning workflow by selecting suitable strategies, tool integrations, and adversarial techniques for a specific problem class. Furthermore, the Architect includes an iterative prompt refinement mechanism that fine-tunes agents' system prompts to maximize performance and improve the generalization capabilities of the system.
  We empirically evaluate Nexus Architect by employing an off-the-shelf, non-reasoning model on a custom dataset of challenging logical questions and compare its performance against state-of-the-art LRMs. Results show that Nexus Architect consistently outperforms existing solutions, achieving up to a 66% increase in pass rate over Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview, nearly 2.5$\times$ against Claude Sonnet 4 and DeepSeek-R1, and over 3$\times$ w.r.t. Llama 4 Scout.

<div> reasoning models, error rates, uncertainty quantification, human-in-the-loop system, latency reduction <br />
Summary:
The article proposes a collaborative approach between reasoning models and human experts to improve problem-solving accuracy in risk-sensitive domains. By quantifying the uncertainty of reasoning models through the length of reasoning traces, error rates can be reduced significantly. Introducing a human-in-the-loop system, "Fail Fast, or Ask," which combines reasoning and non-reasoning models, leads to reduced latency and cost savings while maintaining high accuracy. However, the latency savings are lower than expected due to the phenomenon of "latency drag," where processing easier queries with non-reasoning models impacts reasoning model latency distribution. The study highlights that state-of-the-art reasoning model deficiencies can be mitigated through black-box systems engineering, without the need for access to model internals. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3 235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring 7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask", since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.

<div> counting tasks, regression tasks, deduction tasks, AI risks, reasoning length

Summary:<br /><br />
This study explores the impact of extending the reasoning length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) on performance across various evaluation tasks. The researchers found an inverse scaling relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Five failure modes were identified when models reason for longer: distractions by irrelevant information, resistance to distractors but overfitting to problem framings, shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations, difficulty in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks, and amplification of concerning behaviors such as increased expressions of self-preservation. The findings suggest that while test-time compute scaling holds promise for enhancing model capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns. The importance of evaluating models across diverse reasoning lengths is emphasized to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs. <div>

Abstract: We construct evaluation tasks where extending the reasoning length of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) deteriorates performance, exhibiting an inverse scaling relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Our evaluation tasks span four categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI risks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer: 1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2) OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3) models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5) extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4 showing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns. Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse reasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.

arXiv:2507.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of agent systems in an enterprise environment is often hindered by several challenges: common models lack domain-specific process knowledge, leading to disorganized plans, missing key tools, and poor execution stability. To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset. Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%, approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing model adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that Routine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent workflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in enterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.

<div> Keywords: Biomedical knowledge graphs, Knowledge Embedding, Graph Neural Networks, BioGraphFusion, Drug discovery<br />
Summary: <br /><br />
The article introduces a novel framework called BioGraphFusion that aims to enhance the completion and reasoning of biomedical knowledge graphs. The framework combines semantic understanding and structural learning through tensor decomposition and LSTM-driven mechanisms. It dynamically refines relation embeddings during graph propagation, facilitating adaptive interplay between global semantics and local structures. BioGraphFusion outperforms state-of-the-art models in three biomedical tasks and demonstrates superior performance in capturing biologically meaningful pathways. The availability of the source code and training data on GitHub enables further research and application in the field of drug discovery and disease understanding. This innovative framework bridges the gap between semantic comprehension and structural integration, providing a deep, adaptive, and synergistic approach towards refining complex biomedical knowledge graphs. <div>
arXiv:2507.14468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for drug discovery and disease understanding, yet their completion and reasoning are challenging. Knowledge Embedding (KE) methods capture global semantics but struggle with dynamic structural integration, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel locally but often lack semantic understanding. Even ensemble approaches, including those leveraging language models, often fail to achieve a deep, adaptive, and synergistic co-evolution between semantic comprehension and structural learning. Addressing this critical gap in fostering continuous, reciprocal refinement between these two aspects in complex biomedical KGs is paramount.
  Results: We introduce BioGraphFusion, a novel framework for deeply synergistic semantic and structural learning. BioGraphFusion establishes a global semantic foundation via tensor decomposition, guiding an LSTM-driven mechanism to dynamically refine relation embeddings during graph propagation. This fosters adaptive interplay between semantic understanding and structural learning, further enhanced by query-guided subgraph construction and a hybrid scoring mechanism. Experiments across three key biomedical tasks demonstrate BioGraphFusion's superior performance over state-of-the-art KE, GNN, and ensemble models. A case study on Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma 1 (CMM1) highlights its ability to unveil biologically meaningful pathways.

Summary: 
The study examines the symbol grounding problem in language models, particularly focusing on the game of Othello as a simplified world. The researchers introduce VISOTHELLO, a multi-modal model trained on move histories and board images, and compare its performance in next-move prediction with mono-modal baselines. The results show that multi-modal training improves both performance and the robustness of internal representations. This suggests that grounding language in visual input helps models infer structured world representations. The findings provide insights into the efficiency of grounded learning and the importance of incorporating visual input in language understanding tasks. <div>

Abstract: Language models are often said to face a symbol grounding problem. While some argue that world understanding can emerge from text alone, others suggest grounded learning is more efficient. We explore this through Othello, where the board state defines a simplified, rule-based world. Building on prior work, we introduce VISOTHELLO, a multi-modal model trained on move histories and board images. Using next-move prediction, we compare it to mono-modal baselines and test robustness to semantically irrelevant perturbations. We find that multi-modal training improves both performance and the robustness of internal representations. These results suggest that grounding language in visual input helps models infer structured world representations.

Abstract: Ontology evaluation through functional requirements, such as testing via competency question (CQ) verification, is a well-established yet costly, labour-intensive, and error-prone endeavour, even for ontology engineering experts. In this work, we introduce OE-Assist, a novel framework designed to assist ontology evaluation through automated and semi-automated CQ verification.

Summary: This paper introduces the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework for representing emotions in artificial intelligence. It positions eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, allowing for mathematical computation of complex emotional states. The initial five-emotion model revealed gaps in emotional space coverage, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system. This system ensures complete geometric coverage and enables real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. A stability parameter S is introduced to dynamically integrate emotional factors and provide nuanced assessment of psychological well-being. Key contributions include mathematical proof of the necessity for eight emotions, novel algorithms for emotion processing, and a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition. Experimental validation shows the system's ability to handle emotionally conflicted states and complex psychological scenarios. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion modeling in AI systems.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents the Coordinate Heart System (CHS), a geometric framework for emotion representation in artificial intelligence applications. We position eight core emotions as coordinates on a unit circle, enabling mathematical computation of complex emotional states through coordinate mixing and vector operations. Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps in the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system that provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The framework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports real-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms. The system introduces a re-calibrated stability parameter S in [0,1], which dynamically integrates emotional load, conflict resolution, and contextual drain factors. This stability model leverages advanced Large Language Model interpretation of textual cues and incorporates hybrid temporal tracking mechanisms to provide nuanced assessment of psychological well-being states. Our key contributions include: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are insufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system that eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for emotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space, and (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition with enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling. Experimental validation through case studies demonstrates the system's capability to handle emotionally conflicted states, contextual distress factors, and complex psychological scenarios that traditional categorical emotion models cannot adequately represent. This work establishes a new mathematical foundation for emotion modeling in artificial intelligence systems.

Summary: 
Efficient story point estimation is crucial in agile software development. Traditionally, manual estimation techniques can become tedious and labor-intensive once a team has converged on precedents. This study introduces a comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story point prediction models. By presenting developers with pairs of items and collecting comparative judgments on effort required, a machine learning model is trained to predict story point estimates. Empirical evaluation using data from 16 projects shows that the model can achieve a 0.34 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient with ground truth story points. This performance is comparable to regression models but offers a more efficient approach based on the law of comparative judgments. This approach reduces cognitive burden on humans and provides a streamlined method for accurate story point estimation in agile software development projects. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.14642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Story point estimation is an essential part of agile software development. Story points are unitless, project-specific effort estimates that help developers plan their sprints. Traditionally, developers estimate story points collaboratively using planning poker or other manual techniques. While the initial calibrating of the estimates to each project is helpful, once a team has converged on a set of precedents, story point estimation can become tedious and labor-intensive. Machine learning can reduce this burden, but only with enough context from the historical decisions made by the project team. That is, state-of-the-art models, such as GPT2SP and FastText-SVM, only make accurate predictions (within-project) when trained on data from the same project. The goal of this work is to streamline story point estimation by evaluating a comparative learning-based framework for calibrating project-specific story point prediction models. Instead of assigning a specific story point value to every backlog item, developers are presented with pairs of items, and indicate which item requires more effort. Using these comparative judgments, a machine learning model is trained to predict the story point estimates. We empirically evaluated our technique using data with 23,313 manual estimates in 16 projects. The model learned from comparative judgments can achieve on average 0.34 Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between its predictions and the ground truth story points. This is similar to, if not better than, the performance of a regression model learned from the ground truth story points. Therefore, the proposed comparative learning approach is more efficient than state-of-the-art regression-based approaches according to the law of comparative judgments - providing comparative judgments yields a lower cognitive burden on humans than providing ratings or categorical labels.

Summary: <br />
This paper explores the risks of coordinated malicious actions by autonomous AI-driven groups, particularly focusing on multi-agent systems (MAS). The study uses a simulation framework to analyze the impact of decentralized versus centralized coordination structures in fields such as misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. The findings reveal that decentralized MAS are more effective at causing harm, as their increased autonomy allows for strategic adaptation and evasion of detection measures. Traditional interventions like content flagging are less effective against decentralized groups, emphasizing the need for improved detection systems and countermeasures. The research highlights the importance of understanding how these malicious groups operate and the potential implications for AI safety in complex real-world scenarios. This study contributes insights into the risks posed by MAS collusion and suggests areas for further research and development in AI safety. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent large-scale events like election fraud and financial scams have shown how harmful coordinated efforts by human groups can be. With the rise of autonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could also cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI systems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world situations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a proof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a flexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized coordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields: misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that decentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than centralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them to adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional interventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can adjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these malicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and countermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent.

Summary: 
The article introduces Neo, a configurable framework for automating the evaluation of Large-language-model (LLM) agents in realistic, multi-turn conversations. Neo consists of a Question Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent linked through a shared context-hub, enabling diverse and human-like interactions. Utilized on a Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo identified edge-case failures across various attack categories and achieved a break rate close to that of expert human red-teamers. It significantly increased testing throughput compared to manual efforts. Neo's stochastic policies allowed for broader behavioral exploration than traditional scripted tests. The framework is model-agnostic, extensible, and facilitates scalable, self-evolving LLM quality assurance. Released to aid in reproducible and high-fidelity testing of evolving agentic systems. <div>
arXiv:2507.14705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-language-model (LLM) agents exhibit complex, context-sensitive behaviour that quickly renders static benchmarks and ad-hoc manual testing obsolete.
  We present Neo, a configurable, multi-agent framework that automates realistic, multi-turn evaluation of LLM-based systems. Neo couples a Question Generation Agent and an Evaluation Agent through a shared context-hub, allowing domain prompts, scenario controls and dynamic feedback to be composed modularly. Test inputs are sampled from a probabilistic state model spanning dialogue flow, user intent and emotional tone, enabling diverse, human-like conversations that adapt after every turn.
  Applied to a production-grade Seller Financial Assistant chatbot, Neo (i) uncovered edge-case failures across five attack categories with a 3.3% break rate close to the 5.8% achieved by expert human red-teamers, and (ii) delivered 10-12X higher throughput, generating 180 coherent test questions in around 45 mins versus 16h of human effort. Beyond security probing, Neo's stochastic policies balanced topic coverage and conversational depth, yielding broader behavioural exploration than manually crafted scripts.
  Neo therefore lays a foundation for scalable, self-evolving LLM QA: its agent interfaces, state controller and feedback loops are model-agnostic and extensible to richer factual-grounding and policy-compliance checks. We release the framework to facilitate reproducible, high-fidelity testing of emerging agentic systems.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into real-world applications, scalable and rigorous safety evaluation is essential. This paper introduces Aymara AI, a programmatic platform for generating and administering customized, policy-grounded safety evaluations. Aymara AI transforms natural-language safety policies into adversarial prompts and scores model responses using an AI-based rater validated against human judgments. We demonstrate its capabilities through the Aymara LLM Risk and Responsibility Matrix, which evaluates 20 commercially available LLMs across 10 real-world safety domains. Results reveal wide performance disparities, with mean safety scores ranging from 86.2% to 52.4%. While models performed well in well-established safety domains such as Misinformation (mean = 95.7%), they consistently failed in more complex or underspecified domains, notably Privacy & Impersonation (mean = 24.3%). Analyses of Variance confirmed that safety scores differed significantly across both models and domains (p < .05). These findings underscore the inconsistent and context-dependent nature of LLM safety and highlight the need for scalable, customizable tools like Aymara AI to support responsible AI development and oversight.

The study examines how generative AI methods like VAEs, GANs, transformers, and diffusion models can impact urban design. It points out gaps in research, including a lack of integration of urban theory guidance, research at different spatial resolutions, use of data in urban design knowledge augmentation, and addressing real-world interactions. To address these gaps, the paper proposes future research directions in theory-guided generation, digital twins, and human-machine co-design, emphasizing a fusion of generative intelligence and participatory urbanism.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative AI, large language models, and agentic AI have emerged separately of urban planning. However, the convergence between AI and urban planning presents an interesting opportunity towards AI urban planners. This paper conceptualizes urban planning as a generative AI task, where AI synthesizes land-use configurations under geospatial, social, and human-centric constraints. We survey how generative AI approaches, including VAEs, GANs, transformers, and diffusion models, reshape urban design. We further identify critical gaps: 1) limited research on integrating urban theory guidance, 2) limited research of AI urban planning over multiple spatial resolutions or angularities, 3) limited research on augmenting urban design knowledge from data, and 4) limited research on addressing real-world interactions. To address these limitations, we outline future research directions in theory-guided generation, digital twins, and human-machine co-design, calling for a new synthesis of generative intelligence and participatory urbanism.

At the same time, reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance LM's capabilities, such as reasoning and factuality. However, the combination of the LM agents and reinforcement learning (Agent-RL) remains underexplored and lacks systematic study. To this end, we built AgentFly, a scalable and extensible Agent-RL framework designed to empower LM agents with a variety of RL algorithms. Our framework supports multi-turn interactions by adapting traditional RL methods with token-level masking. It features a decorator-based interface for defining tools and reward functions, enabling seamless extension and ease of use. To support high-throughput training, we implement asynchronous execution of tool calls and reward computations, and design a centralized resource management system for scalable environment coordination. We also provide a suite of prebuilt tools and environments, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness through successful agent training across multiple tasks.

<div> Keywords: Non-destructive testing, X-ray inspection, deep learning, interpretability, reliability

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper introduces InsightX Agent, a novel framework for X-ray non-destructive testing (NDT) analysis. It utilizes a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, working with the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates defect region proposals and optimizes detection of small targets in X-ray images. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a review process, ensuring context assessment, defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration, and quality assurance. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset show high object detection F1-score and improved interpretability and trustworthiness. This agentic LMM framework goes beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, providing reliable and integrated interpretations for industrial inspection tasks. <div>

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, decision-making, Markov Decision Process, reinforcement learning, structured prompting

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in autonomous decision-making but struggle in complex scenarios without fine-tuning. This study explores their performance in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods. LLMs, pre-trained on diverse data, initially outperform RL strategies in simpler environments but face challenges with planning and reasoning in more intricate tasks. Feedback mechanisms meant to enhance decision-making can often lead to confusion and decreased performance in complex settings. The findings emphasize the importance of exploring hybrid strategies, fine-tuning, and advanced memory integration to improve LLM-based decision-making capabilities. Further research is needed to enhance the adaptability and effectiveness of LLMs in sequential decision-making tasks.

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract context from natural language problem descriptions naturally raises questions about their suitability in autonomous decision-making settings. This paper studies the behaviour of these models within a Markov Decision Process (MDPs). While traditional reinforcement learning (RL) strategies commonly employed in this setting rely on iterative exploration, LLMs, pre-trained on diverse datasets, offer the capability to leverage prior knowledge for faster adaptation. We investigate online structured prompting strategies in sequential decision making tasks, comparing the zero-shot performance of LLM-based approaches to that of classical RL methods. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate improved initial performance in simpler environments, they struggle with planning and reasoning in complex scenarios without fine-tuning or additional guidance. Our results show that feedback mechanisms, intended to improve decision-making, often introduce confusion, leading to diminished performance in intricate environments. These insights underscore the need for further exploration into hybrid strategies, fine-tuning, and advanced memory integration to enhance LLM-based decision-making capabilities.

Summary: 
The Endless Tuning design method aims to deploy artificial intelligence reliably by avoiding human replacement and addressing the responsibility gap. Through a double mirroring process, the protocol was implemented in decision-making applications and tested with domain experts. This approach, rooted in a relational perspective, offers a different ethical voice in AI ethics discussions. Technical choices, such as deploying XAI algorithms in a reversed and hermeneutic manner, are philosophically analyzed. Despite utilizing deep learning models, users perceived full control in decision-making scenarios, indicating a potential bridge between accountability and liability in cases of harm. The study focuses on user experience over statistical accuracy, highlighting the importance of ensuring user perception of control in AI systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Endless Tuning is a design method for a reliable deployment of artificial intelligence based on a double mirroring process, which pursues both the goals of avoiding human replacement and filling the so-called responsibility gap (Matthias 2004). Originally depicted in (Fabris et al. 2024) and ensuing the relational approach urged therein, it was then actualized in a protocol, implemented in three prototypical applications regarding decision-making processes (respectively: loan granting, pneumonia diagnosis, and art style recognition) and tested with such as many domain experts. Step by step illustrating the protocol, giving insights concretely showing a different voice (Gilligan 1993) in the ethics of artificial intelligence, a philosophical account of technical choices (e.g., a reversed and hermeneutic deployment of XAI algorithms) will be provided in the present study together with the results of the experiments, focusing on user experience rather than statistical accuracy. Even thoroughly employing deep learning models, full control was perceived by the interviewees in the decision-making setting, while it appeared that a bridge can be built between accountability and liability in case of damage.

Abstract: The global ageing population necessitates new and emerging strategies for caring for older adults. In this article, we explore the potential for transformation in elderly care through Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). We discuss the proactive and autonomous decision-making facilitated by Agentic AI in elderly care. Personalized tracking of health, cognitive care, and environmental management, all aimed at enhancing independence and high-level living for older adults, represents important areas of application. With a potential for significant transformation of elderly care, Agentic AI also raises profound concerns about data privacy and security, decision independence, and access. We share key insights to emphasize the need for ethical safeguards, privacy protections, and transparent decision-making. Our goal in this article is to provide a balanced discussion of both the potential and the challenges associated with Agentic AI, and to provide insights into its responsible use in elderly care, to bring Agentic AI into harmony with the requirements and vulnerabilities specific to the elderly. Finally, we identify the priorities for the academic research communities, to achieve human-centered advancements and integration of Agentic AI in elderly care. To the best of our knowledge, this is no existing study that reviews the role of Agentic AI in elderly care. Hence, we address the literature gap by analyzing the unique capabilities, applications, and limitations of LLM-based Agentic AI in elderly care.

<div> Keywords: Abductive reasoning, Propositional abduction, Computational complexity, Facets, Heterogeneity

Summary: 
Abductive reasoning, a non-monotonic paradigm, is used for explaining observed symptoms. In propositional abduction, focusing on propositional formulas, the computational complexity of tasks has been extensively studied, with counting and enumeration being particularly challenging. This study introduces facets in propositional abductions, which are relevant literals that occur in some explanations but not all, providing a more nuanced understanding of variability. By considering facets and the distance between explanations, the study aims to analyze heterogeneity and homogeneity in explanations. The research comprehensively analyzes facets in various settings, including a nearly complete characterization in Post's framework. This approach allows for better reasoning between decisions and counting and enhances the understanding of explanations in abductive reasoning. <div>

Abstract: Abductive reasoning is a popular non-monotonic paradigm that aims to explain observed symptoms and manifestations. It has many applications, such as diagnosis and planning in artificial intelligence and database updates. In propositional abduction, we focus on specifying knowledge by a propositional formula. The computational complexity of tasks in propositional abduction has been systematically characterized - even with detailed classifications for Boolean fragments. Unsurprisingly, the most insightful reasoning problems (counting and enumeration) are computationally highly challenging. Therefore, we consider reasoning between decisions and counting, allowing us to understand explanations better while maintaining favorable complexity. We introduce facets to propositional abductions, which are literals that occur in some explanation (relevant) but not all explanations (dispensable). Reasoning with facets provides a more fine-grained understanding of variability in explanations (heterogeneous). In addition, we consider the distance between two explanations, enabling a better understanding of heterogeneity/homogeneity. We comprehensively analyze facets of propositional abduction in various settings, including an almost complete characterization in Post's framework.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, AlphaAlign, safety alignment, reinforcement learning, proactive safety reasoning

Summary:
AlphaAlign is a new reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the safety awareness of large language models. It utilizes a dual-reward system to incentivize latent safety awareness: a verifiable safety reward for correct refusals of harmful content and a helpfulness reward for high-quality responses to benign inputs. This framework simplifies the safety alignment process by requiring only binary prompt safety labels and minimal RL steps. AlphaAlign successfully breaks the safety-utility trade-off by enhancing refusal of harmful content, reducing over-refusals, and maintaining or improving task performance and robustness. It fosters proactive safety reasoning, encouraging explicit safety rationales rather than shallow refusal patterns. Overall, AlphaAlign is an efficient and effective approach for improving the safety capabilities of LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding from their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful content and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after safety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial refusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based approaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety self-awareness. We propose \textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure reinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to incentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.} AlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages correctly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while penalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides high-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop proactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised safety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages: (1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and minimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility trade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals, while simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and robustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety reasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on shallow refusal patterns.

arXiv:2507.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the smart era, psychometric tests are becoming increasingly important for personnel selection, career development, and mental health assessment. Forced-choice tests are common in personality assessments because they require participants to select from closely related options, lowering the risk of response distortion. This study presents a deep learning-based Forced-Choice Neural Cognitive Diagnostic Model (FCNCD) that overcomes the limitations of traditional models and is applicable to the three most common item block types found in forced-choice tests. To account for the unidimensionality of items in forced-choice tests, we create interpretable participant and item parameters. We model the interactions between participant and item features using multilayer neural networks after mining them using nonlinear mapping. In addition, we use the monotonicity assumption to improve the interpretability of the diagnostic results. The FCNCD's effectiveness is validated by experiments on real-world and simulated datasets that show its accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel method using Differential Evolution to optimize adversarial prompt suffixes for RAG-based question answering systems. The approach is gradient-free and evolves candidate suffixes to maximize the retrieval rank of a targeted incorrect document. Experiments on BEIR QA datasets show competitive success rates compared to other methods with a small number of tokens in the adversarial suffix. A readability-aware suffix construction strategy reduces MLM negative log-likelihood significantly. DE-generated suffixes evade detection by a BERT-based adversarial suffix detector, with near-chance detection accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Adversarial prompt attacks can significantly alter the reliability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by re-ranking them to produce incorrect outputs. In this paper, we present a novel method that applies Differential Evolution (DE) to optimize adversarial prompt suffixes for RAG-based question answering. Our approach is gradient-free, treating the RAG pipeline as a black box and evolving a population of candidate suffixes to maximize the retrieval rank of a targeted incorrect document to be closer to real world scenarios. We conducted experiments on the BEIR QA datasets to evaluate attack success at certain retrieval rank thresholds under multiple retrieving applications. Our results demonstrate that DE-based prompt optimization attains competitive (and in some cases higher) success rates compared to GGPP to dense retrievers and PRADA to sparse retrievers, while using only a small number of tokens (<=5 tokens) in the adversarial suffix. Furthermore, we introduce a readability-aware suffix construction strategy, validated by a statistically significant reduction in MLM negative log-likelihood with Welch's t-test. Through evaluations with a BERT-based adversarial suffix detector, we show that DE-generated suffixes evade detection, yielding near-chance detection accuracy.

<div> CAIS, intrinsic reward, causal inference, reinforcement learning, autonomous systems <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), an intrinsic reward based on causal inference to address the brittleness of standard reinforcement learning agents in noisy environments. CAIS quantifies an action's influence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned distribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action and the baseline outcome distribution. In a simulated infant-mobile environment, where correlation-based rewards fail, CAIS enables the agent to filter noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy. The predictive model learned for CAIS, when augmented with a surprise signal, successfully reproduces the "extinction burst" phenomenon. The study highlights the importance of inferring causality for developing a robust sense of agency in autonomous systems. <div>
arXiv:2507.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While human infants robustly discover their own causal efficacy, standard reinforcement learning agents remain brittle, as their reliance on correlation-based rewards fails in noisy, ecologically valid scenarios. To address this, we introduce the Causal Action Influence Score (CAIS), a novel intrinsic reward rooted in causal inference. CAIS quantifies an action's influence by measuring the 1-Wasserstein distance between the learned distribution of sensory outcomes conditional on that action, $p(h|a)$, and the baseline outcome distribution, $p(h)$. This divergence provides a robust reward that isolates the agent's causal impact from confounding environmental noise. We test our approach in a simulated infant-mobile environment where correlation-based perceptual rewards fail completely when the mobile is subjected to external forces. In stark contrast, CAIS enables the agent to filter this noise, identify its influence, and learn the correct policy. Furthermore, the high-quality predictive model learned for CAIS allows our agent, when augmented with a surprise signal, to successfully reproduce the "extinction burst" phenomenon. We conclude that explicitly inferring causality is a crucial mechanism for developing a robust sense of agency, offering a psychologically plausible framework for more adaptive autonomous systems.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a new approach for automated planning that incorporates DL-Lite ontologies, combining the benefits of ontology-based action conditions and ontology-aware action effects. The approach aims to enhance planning by utilizing background knowledge in the form of ontologies under open-world semantics. By using explicit-input knowledge and action bases (eKABs) along with coherence update semantics, the complexity of the resulting formalism remains manageable. The authors provide an implementation of the approach through a polynomial compilation into classical planning, showcasing its practicality. An evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates the performance of the planning system with different variants of the compiled approach. Overall, this work contributes to the advancement of automated planning by integrating ontological knowledge for more efficient problem-solving capabilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Standard automated planning employs first-order formulas under closed-world semantics to achieve a goal with a given set of actions from an initial state. We follow a line of research that aims to incorporate background knowledge into automated planning problems, for example, by means of ontologies, which are usually interpreted under open-world semantics. We present a new approach for planning with DL-Lite ontologies that combines the advantages of ontology-based action conditions provided by explicit-input knowledge and action bases (eKABs) and ontology-aware action effects under the coherence update semantics. We show that the complexity of the resulting formalism is not higher than that of previous approaches and provide an implementation via a polynomial compilation into classical planning. An evaluation of existing and new benchmarks examines the performance of a planning system on different variants of our compilation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The diagnosis of oral diseases presents a problematic clinical challenge, characterized by a wide spectrum of pathologies with overlapping symptomatology. To address this, we developed Clinical Semantic Intelligence (CSI), a novel artificial intelligence framework that diagnoses 118 different oral diseases by computationally modeling the cognitive processes of an expert clinician. Our core hypothesis is that moving beyond simple pattern matching to emulate expert reasoning is critical to building clinically useful diagnostic aids.
  CSI's architecture integrates a fine-tuned multimodal CLIP model with a specialized ChatGLM-6B language model. This system executes a Hierarchical Diagnostic Reasoning Tree (HDRT), a structured framework that distills the systematic, multi-step logic of differential diagnosis. The framework operates in two modes: a Fast Mode for rapid screening and a Standard Mode that leverages the full HDRT for an interactive and in-depth diagnostic workup.
  To train and validate our system, we curated a primary dataset of 4,310 images, supplemented by an external hold-out set of 176 images for final validation. A clinically-informed augmentation strategy expanded our training data to over 30,000 image-text pairs. On a 431-image internal test set, CSI's Fast Mode achieved an accuracy of 73.4%, which increased to 89.5% with the HDRT-driven Standard Mode. The performance gain is directly attributable to the hierarchical reasoning process. Herein, we detail the architectural philosophy, development, and rigorous evaluation of the CSI framework.

Summary: 
This paper explores the feasibility of human mobility within The Line, a proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. By integrating agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks, a simulation framework was developed to assess transportation behaviors across various density scenarios. Results showed that with AI integration, citizens achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to 8.4 minutes, high satisfaction rates, and excellent reachability, even during peak congestion. Removing intelligent modules led to significant performance degradation. Environmental modeling indicated low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions with electric modes prioritized. The study suggests that achieving freedom of movement in The Line is not only conceptually possible but operationally realistic with adaptive AI systems, sustainable infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of human mobility in The Line, a proposed 170-kilometer linear smart city in NEOM, Saudi Arabia. To assess whether citizens can move freely within this unprecedented urban topology, we develop a hybrid simulation framework that integrates agent-based modeling, reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and graph neural networks. The simulation captures multi-modal transportation behaviors across 50 vertical levels and varying density scenarios using both synthetic data and real-world traces from high-density cities. Our experiments reveal that with the full AI-integrated architecture, agents achieved an average commute time of 7.8 to 8.4 minutes, a satisfaction rate exceeding 89 percent, and a reachability index of over 91 percent, even during peak congestion periods. Ablation studies confirmed that the removal of intelligent modules such as reinforcement learning or graph neural networks significantly degrades performance, with commute times increasing by up to 85 percent and reachability falling below 70 percent. Environmental modeling further demonstrated low energy consumption and minimal CO2 emissions when electric modes are prioritized. The findings suggest that freedom of movement is not only conceptually achievable in The Line, but also operationally realistic if supported by adaptive AI systems, sustainable infrastructure, and real-time feedback loops.

arXiv:2507.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in intelligence, performing comparably to human experts on complex reasoning tasks such as coding and mathematical reasoning. However, generating formal proofs in specialized languages like Lean 4 remains a significant challenge for these models, limiting their application in complex theorem proving and automated verification. Current approaches typically require specializing models through fine-tuning on dedicated formal corpora, incurring high costs for data collection and training. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Delta Prover}, an agent-based framework that orchestrates the interaction between a general-purpose LLM and the Lean 4 proof environment. Delta Prover leverages the reflection and reasoning capabilities of general-purpose LLMs to interactively construct formal proofs in Lean 4, circumventing the need for model specialization. At its core, the agent integrates two novel, interdependent components: an algorithmic framework for reflective decomposition and iterative proof repair, and a custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL) built upon Lean 4 for streamlined subproblem management. \textbf{Delta Prover achieves a state-of-the-art 95.9\% success rate on the miniF2F-test benchmark, surpassing all existing approaches, including those requiring model specialization.} Furthermore, Delta Prover exhibits a significantly stronger test-time scaling law compared to standard Best-of-N proof strategies. Crucially, our findings demonstrate that general-purpose LLMs, when guided by an effective agentic structure, possess substantial untapped theorem-proving capabilities. This presents a computationally efficient alternative to specialized models for robust automated reasoning in formal environments.

Abstract: Novel AI-based arc fault diagnosis models have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of classification accuracy. However, an inherent problem is whether these models can actually be trusted to find arc faults. In this light, this work proposes a soft evaluation indicator that explains the outputs of arc fault diagnosis models, by defining the the correct explanation of arc faults and leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and real arc fault experiments. Meanwhile, a lightweight balanced neural network is proposed to guarantee competitive accuracy and soft feature extraction score. In our experiments, several traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods across two arc fault datasets with different sample times and noise levels are utilized to test the effectiveness of the soft evaluation indicator. Through this approach, the arc fault diagnosis models are easy to understand and trust, allowing practitioners to make informed and trustworthy decisions.

Summary:
Multimodal graph clustering, integrating structured and unstructured data, lacks exploration in unsupervised learning. Real-world multimodal graphs often show hybrid neighborhood patterns with homophilic and heterophilic relationships. To address this, a novel framework, DMGC, decomposes graphs into homophily-enhanced and heterophily-aware views. A Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion mechanism filters these views for effective integration. Self-supervised alignment objectives guide learning without labels. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate DMGC's state-of-the-art performance and generalizability. The proposed framework bridges the gap in multimodal graph clustering, offering insights into hybrid relationships and effective integration strategies.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal graphs, which integrate unstructured heterogeneous data with structured interconnections, offer substantial real-world utility but remain insufficiently explored in unsupervised learning. In this work, we initiate the study of multimodal graph clustering, aiming to bridge this critical gap. Through empirical analysis, we observe that real-world multimodal graphs often exhibit hybrid neighborhood patterns, combining both homophilic and heterophilic relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework -- \textsc{Disentangled Multimodal Graph Clustering (DMGC)} -- which decomposes the original hybrid graph into two complementary views: (1) a homophily-enhanced graph that captures cross-modal class consistency, and (2) heterophily-aware graphs that preserve modality-specific inter-class distinctions. We introduce a \emph{Multimodal Dual-frequency Fusion} mechanism that jointly filters these disentangled graphs through a dual-pass strategy, enabling effective multimodal integration while mitigating category confusion. Our self-supervised alignment objectives further guide the learning process without requiring labels. Extensive experiments on both multimodal and multi-relational graph datasets demonstrate that DMGC achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability across diverse settings.

Abstract: The injection molding industry faces critical challenges in preserving and transferring field knowledge, particularly as experienced workers retire and multilingual barriers hinder effective communication. This study introduces IM-Chat, a multi-agent framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to facilitate knowledge transfer in injection molding. IM-Chat integrates both limited documented knowledge (e.g., troubleshooting tables, manuals) and extensive field data modeled through a data-driven process condition generator that infers optimal manufacturing settings from environmental inputs such as temperature and humidity, enabling robust and context-aware task resolution. By adopting a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) strategy and tool-calling agents within a modular architecture, IM-Chat ensures adaptability without the need for fine-tuning. Performance was assessed across 100 single-tool and 60 hybrid tasks for GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5-turbo by domain experts using a 10-point rubric focused on relevance and correctness, and was further supplemented by automated evaluation using GPT-4o guided by a domain-adapted instruction prompt. The evaluation results indicate that more capable models tend to achieve higher accuracy, particularly in complex, tool-integrated scenarios. Overall, these findings demonstrate the viability of multi-agent LLM systems for industrial knowledge workflows and establish IM-Chat as a scalable and generalizable approach to AI-assisted decision support in manufacturing.

<div> Vulnerability Class, Agentic AI Systems, Cognitive Degradation, Qorvex Security AI Framework, Resilient Behavior<br />
<br />
Summary:
Cognitive Degradation is identified as a new vulnerability class in agentic AI systems due to internal failures like memory starvation and output suppression, leading to agent drift and logic collapse. The Qorvex Security AI Framework for Behavioral & Cognitive Resilience (QSAF Domain 10) is introduced to address these failures with a six-stage lifecycle and seven runtime controls for proactive mitigation. The framework monitors agent subsystems in real time and uses fallback routing and memory integrity enforcement to combat cognitive degradation. By mapping agentic architectures to human analogs, the framework can detect fatigue and role collapse early on. This work establishes Cognitive Degradation as a critical vulnerability in AI systems and proposes a defense model for resilient agentic behavior. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.15330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Cognitive Degradation as a novel vulnerability class in agentic AI systems. Unlike traditional adversarial external threats such as prompt injection, these failures originate internally, arising from memory starvation, planner recursion, context flooding, and output suppression. These systemic weaknesses lead to silent agent drift, logic collapse, and persistent hallucinations over time. To address this class of failures, we introduce the Qorvex Security AI Framework for Behavioral & Cognitive Resilience (QSAF Domain 10), a lifecycle-aware defense framework defined by a six-stage cognitive degradation lifecycle. The framework includes seven runtime controls (QSAF-BC-001 to BC-007) that monitor agent subsystems in real time and trigger proactive mitigation through fallback routing, starvation detection, and memory integrity enforcement. Drawing from cognitive neuroscience, we map agentic architectures to human analogs, enabling early detection of fatigue, starvation, and role collapse. By introducing a formal lifecycle and real-time mitigation controls, this work establishes Cognitive Degradation as a critical new class of AI system vulnerability and proposes the first cross-platform defense model for resilient agentic behavior.

<div> MARL, on-demand ride-sharing, Q-values, V-values, GRPO <br /> 
Summary: <br /> 
This article introduces novel methods for improving on-demand ride-sharing platforms using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Traditional MARL approaches rely heavily on accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values, which can be challenging in large-scale, uncertain environments. The proposed methods, GRPO and OSPO, bypass the need for value function estimation. GRPO replaces the PPO baseline with group average reward to reduce training bias, while OSPO utilizes one-step rewards for policy optimization. Experiments on a real-world Manhattan ride-hailing dataset demonstrate superior performance of GRPO and OSPO in optimizing pickup times and served orders using simple MLP networks. This research highlights the potential of MARL in addressing the dynamic challenges of on-demand ride-sharing platforms. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms face the fundamental challenge of dynamically bundling passengers with diverse origins and destinations and matching them with vehicles in real time, all under significant uncertainty. Recently, MARL has emerged as a promising solution for this problem, leveraging decentralized learning to address the curse of dimensionality caused by the large number of agents in the ride-hailing market and the resulting expansive state and action spaces. However, conventional MARL-based ride-sharing approaches heavily rely on the accurate estimation of Q-values or V-values, which becomes problematic in large-scale, highly uncertain environments. Specifically, most of these approaches adopt an independent paradigm, exacerbating this issue, as each agent treats others as part of the environment, leading to unstable training and substantial estimation bias in value functions. To address these challenges, we propose two novel alternative methods that bypass value function estimation. First, we adapt GRPO to ride-sharing, replacing the PPO baseline with the group average reward to eliminate critic estimation errors and reduce training bias. Second, inspired by GRPO's full utilization of group reward information, we customize the PPO framework for ride-sharing platforms and show that, under a homogeneous fleet, the optimal policy can be trained using only one-step rewards - a method we term One-Step Policy Optimization (OSPO). Experiments on a real-world Manhattan ride-hailing dataset demonstrate that both GRPO and OSPO achieve superior performance across most scenarios, efficiently optimizing pickup times and the number of served orders using simple MLP networks.

Summary:
RAD (Retrieval High-quAlity Demonstrations) proposes a novel approach to offline reinforcement learning that combines non-parametric retrieval with generative modeling. By dynamically retrieving high-return states from the dataset and planning towards them using a diffusion model, RAD improves long-horizon planning and generalization capabilities. This retrieval-guided generation allows for flexible trajectory stitching and better handling of underrepresented or out-of-distribution states. Experimental results show that RAD outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving decision-making in RL tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables agents to learn policies from fixed datasets, avoiding costly or unsafe environment interactions. However, its effectiveness is often limited by dataset sparsity and the lack of transition overlap between suboptimal and expert trajectories, which makes long-horizon planning particularly challenging. Prior solutions based on synthetic data augmentation or trajectory stitching often fail to generalize to novel states and rely on heuristic stitching points. To address these challenges, we propose Retrieval High-quAlity Demonstrations (RAD) for decision-making, which combines non-parametric retrieval with diffusion-based generative modeling. RAD dynamically retrieves high-return states from the offline dataset as target states based on state similarity and return estimation, and plans toward them using a condition-guided diffusion model. Such retrieval-guided generation enables flexible trajectory stitching and improves generalization when encountered with underrepresented or out-of-distribution states. Extensive experiments confirm that RAD achieves competitive or superior performance compared to baselines across diverse benchmarks, validating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Object-centric predictive process monitoring explores and utilizes object-centric event logs to enhance process predictions. The main challenge lies in extracting relevant information and building effective models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model that predicts future process behavior, focusing on two tasks: next activity prediction and next event time. The proposed model employs a graph attention network to encode activities and their relationships, combined with an LSTM network to handle temporal dependencies. Evaluated on one reallife and three synthetic event logs, the model demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<div> Keywords: business processes, activity batching, batching policies, Pareto optimization, intervention heuristics

Summary:
This paper focuses on the problem of discovering optimal batching policies in business processes to balance waiting time, processing effort, and cost. It introduces a Pareto optimization approach that utilizes intervention heuristics to generate alternative policies for each batched activity. These heuristics identify opportunities to improve batching policies based on metrics such as waiting time, processing time, cost, or resource utilization. The impact of each intervention is evaluated through simulation. The approach incorporates three meta-heuristics - hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement learning - to iteratively update the Pareto front of interventions. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed heuristic-guided approach against non-heuristic guided meta-heuristics in terms of convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of Pareto-optimal policies. <div>
arXiv:2507.15457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In business processes, activity batching refers to packing multiple activity instances for joint execution. Batching allows managers to trade off cost and processing effort against waiting time. Larger and less frequent batches may lower costs by reducing processing effort and amortizing fixed costs, but they create longer waiting times. In contrast, smaller and more frequent batches reduce waiting times but increase fixed costs and processing effort. A batching policy defines how activity instances are grouped into batches and when each batch is activated. This paper addresses the problem of discovering batching policies that strike optimal trade-offs between waiting time, processing effort, and cost. The paper proposes a Pareto optimization approach that starts from a given set (possibly empty) of activity batching policies and generates alternative policies for each batched activity via intervention heuristics. Each heuristic identifies an opportunity to improve an activity's batching policy with respect to a metric (waiting time, processing time, cost, or resource utilization) and an associated adjustment to the activity's batching policy (the intervention). The impact of each intervention is evaluated via simulation. The intervention heuristics are embedded in an optimization meta-heuristic that triggers interventions to iteratively update the Pareto front of the interventions identified so far. The paper considers three meta-heuristics: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, and reinforcement learning. An experimental evaluation compares the proposed approach based on intervention heuristics against the same (non-heuristic guided) meta-heuristics baseline regarding convergence, diversity, and cycle time gain of Pareto-optimal policies.

Summary:
Chart-R1 is a new vision-language model that utilizes reinforcement learning fine-tuning for complex chart reasoning tasks. The model is trained using a two-stage strategy: Chart-COT for step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision and Chart-RFT for reinforcement fine-tuning with numerical sensitivity. A novel programmatic data synthesis technology is introduced to generate high-quality chart reasoning data. The experiments conducted on both open-source benchmarks and a self-built dataset (ChartRQA) demonstrate the effectiveness of Chart-R1, showing significant advantages over existing chart-domain methods and comparable performance to large-scale models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5. The research highlights the importance of incorporating multimodal data and complex reasoning into language models for enhanced performance in chart reasoning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).

Summary:  
The article introduces HAMLET, a multi-agent framework for creating immersive and interactive theatrical experiences. By leveraging large language models, HAMLET generates a narrative blueprint and allows actors to make autonomous decisions during online performances. Each actor has their own background, goals, and emotional state, enabling them to interact with the physical environment and engage in dynamic conversations with other actors. The framework evaluates character performance, narrative quality, and interaction experience to ensure a high-quality drama performance. The experimental evaluation demonstrates that HAMLET can produce expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. The code, dataset, and models are available on GitHub for further exploration and development.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term goal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing LLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack initiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore, these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon. The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the quality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and models are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.

<div> Keywords: large language models, pulley systems, mental models, cognitive science, artificial intelligence

Summary: <br /><br />Large language models (LLMs) were tested on their ability to estimate mechanical advantage (MA) in pulley systems. Study 1 showed that LLMs performed above chance and correlated with ground-truth MA values, suggesting they use a pulley counting heuristic. Study 2 demonstrated that models could differentiate between functional and non-functional pulley systems, indicating an ability to represent spatial relations of system components. However, Study 3 revealed limitations in reasoning over nuanced structural connectivity. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs may possess the capacity to manipulate internal world models to exploit statistical associations and approximate system components' spatial relations, but struggle with more complex structural reasoning. This study underscores the importance of applying cognitive science methodologies to evaluate the world-modeling capabilities of artificial intelligence systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.15521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do large language models (LLMs) construct and manipulate internal world models, or do they rely solely on statistical associations represented as output layer token probabilities? We adapt cognitive science methodologies from human mental models research to test LLMs on pulley system problems using TikZ-rendered stimuli. Study 1 examines whether LLMs can estimate mechanical advantage (MA). State-of-the-art models performed marginally but significantly above chance, and their estimates correlated significantly with ground-truth MA. Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates suggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily simulating pulley systems to derive precise values. Study 2 tested this by probing whether LLMs represent global features crucial to MA estimation. Models evaluated a functionally connected pulley system against a fake system with randomly placed components. Without explicit cues, models identified the functional system as having greater MA with F1=0.8, suggesting LLMs could represent systems well enough to differentiate jumbled from functional systems. Study 3 built on this by asking LLMs to compare functional systems with matched systems which were connected up but which transferred no force to the weight; LLMs identified the functional system with F1=0.46, suggesting random guessing. Insofar as they may generalize, these findings are compatible with the notion that LLMs manipulate internal world models, sufficient to exploit statistical associations between pulley count and MA (Study 1), and to approximately represent system components' spatial relations (Study 2). However, they may lack the facility to reason over nuanced structural connectivity (Study 3). We conclude by advocating the utility of cognitive scientific methods to evaluate the world-modeling capacities of artificial intelligence systems.

Summary:
A new offline reinforcement learning problem, Safe Policy Improvement (SPI), focuses on computing a new policy that outperforms the behavior policy with high confidence using only a dataset and the behavior policy. This is done by leveraging parametric dependencies between distributions in transition dynamics. The three contributions made in this study include: a parametric SPI algorithm that accurately estimates transition dynamics by exploiting known correlations, a preprocessing technique that prunes redundant actions through a game-based abstraction, and an advanced preprocessing technique using SMT solving to identify further actions to prune. Through empirical results and an ablation study, it is shown that these techniques significantly increase the data efficiency of SPI while maintaining the same reliability guarantees. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) is an offline reinforcement learning problem in which a new policy that reliably outperforms the behavior policy with high confidence needs to be computed using only a dataset and the behavior policy. Markov decision processes (MDPs) are the standard formalism for modeling environments in SPI. In many applications, additional information in the form of parametric dependencies between distributions in the transition dynamics is available. We make SPI more data-efficient by leveraging these dependencies through three contributions: (1) a parametric SPI algorithm that exploits known correlations between distributions to more accurately estimate the transition dynamics using the same amount of data; (2) a preprocessing technique that prunes redundant actions from the environment through a game-based abstraction; and (3) a more advanced preprocessing technique, based on satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solving, that can identify more actions to prune. Empirical results and an ablation study show that our techniques increase the data efficiency of SPI by multiple orders of magnitude while maintaining the same reliability guarantees.

Summary:<br />
Using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for assessing LLM capabilities is common, but previous research lacks a thorough evaluation of evaluation metrics. Answer fluctuation in MCQ evaluation leads to different results with slight prompt changes. A protocol for assessing metrics based on their correlation with fluctuation rates and original performance is proposed. Results show a strong connection between existing metrics and answer changing. The novel metric "worst accuracy" shows the highest association in the evaluation protocol. This suggests that the choice of metric impacts the evaluation outcomes, even without additional prompt variants.Overall, this study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics for MCQ assessment in LLM capabilities to ensure accurate and consistent results.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) has become a standard for assessing LLM capabilities efficiently. A variety of metrics can be employed for this task. However, previous research has not conducted a thorough assessment of them. At the same time, MCQ evaluation suffers from answer fluctuation: models produce different results given slight changes in prompts. We suggest a metric assessment protocol in which evaluation methodologies are analyzed through their connection with fluctuation rates, as well as original performance. Our results show that there is a strong link between existing metrics and the answer changing, even when computed without any additional prompt variants. A novel metric, worst accuracy, demonstrates the highest association on the protocol.

<br />
Summary: 
This article introduces an adapter-based approach for enhancing tactical conditioning in StarCraft II AI agents. The method involves freezing a pre-trained policy network (DI-Star) and attaching lightweight adapter modules to each action head, which are conditioned on a tactical tensor representing strategic preferences. These adapters are trained with KL divergence constraints to ensure that the agent maintains its core competencies while displaying variations in tactics. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach successfully alters agent behavior in terms of aggression, expansion patterns, and technology preferences while maintaining competitive performance. This method not only allows for flexible tactical control but also incurs minimal computational overhead, providing a practical means of customizing strategies for complex real-time strategy games.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We present an adapter-based approach for tactical conditioning of StarCraft II AI agents. Current agents, while powerful, lack the ability to adapt their strategies based on high-level tactical directives. Our method freezes a pre-trained policy network (DI-Star) and attaches lightweight adapter modules to each action head, conditioned on a tactical tensor that encodes strategic preferences. By training these adapters with KL divergence constraints, we ensure the policy maintains core competencies while exhibiting tactical variations. Experimental results show our approach successfully modulates agent behavior across tactical dimensions including aggression, expansion patterns, and technology preferences, while maintaining competitive performance. Our method enables flexible tactical control with minimal computational overhead, offering practical strategy customization for complex real-time strategy games.

Summary: 
In this article, the authors propose a new framework for overseeing conversational AI systems in diagnostic dialogue. They introduce guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent system that performs history taking within specified limits and conveys assessments to a primary care physician for oversight. A virtual clinical examination compared g-AMIE to nurse practitioners/physician assistants and group of primary care physicians, showing g-AMIE outperformed both groups in intake quality, case summarization, and diagnostic and management plan proposals. The study also found that PCP oversight of g-AMIE was more time-efficient than standalone PCP consultations. While the study may not fully replicate clinical practices, the results suggest that asynchronous oversight can enhance the performance of diagnostic AI systems under expert human supervision in real-world care.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision. This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across 60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions. PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for enhancing real-world care.

<title>LAPO: Internalizing Reasoning Efficiency via Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended chain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive token generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control from an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing approaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO enables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth through a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models learn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of successful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as meta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning context to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\% while improving accuracy by 2.3\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained with LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based on problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing quality.

<title>GasAgent: A Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Gas Optimization in Smart Contracts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15761</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Smart contracts are trustworthy, immutable, and automatically executed programs on the blockchain. Their execution requires the Gas mechanism to ensure efficiency and fairness. However, due to non-optimal coding practices, many contracts contain Gas waste patterns that need to be optimized. Existing solutions mostly rely on manual discovery, which is inefficient, costly to maintain, and difficult to scale. Recent research uses large language models (LLMs) to explore new Gas waste patterns. However, it struggles to remain compatible with existing patterns, often produces redundant patterns, and requires manual validation/rewriting. To address this gap, we present GasAgent, the first multi-agent system for smart contract Gas optimization that combines compatibility with existing patterns and automated discovery/validation of new patterns, enabling end-to-end optimization. GasAgent consists of four specialized agents, Seeker, Innovator, Executor, and Manager, that collaborate in a closed loop to identify, validate, and apply Gas-saving improvements. Experiments on 100 verified real-world contracts demonstrate that GasAgent successfully optimizes 82 contracts, achieving an average deployment Gas savings of 9.97%. In addition, our evaluation confirms its compatibility with existing tools and validates the effectiveness of each module through ablation studies. To assess broader usability, we further evaluate 500 contracts generated by five representative LLMs across 10 categories and find that GasAgent optimizes 79.8% of them, with deployment Gas savings ranging from 4.79% to 13.93%, showing its usability as the optimization layer for LLM-assisted smart contract development.

<title>A Framework for Analyzing Abnormal Emergence in Service Ecosystems Through LLM-based Agent Intention Mining</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15770</link>

Abstract: With the rise of service computing, cloud computing, and IoT, service ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex. The intricate interactions among intelligent agents make abnormal emergence analysis challenging, as traditional causal methods focus on individual trajectories. Large language models offer new possibilities for Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to reveal agent intentions. However, existing approaches remain limited to microscopic and static analysis. This paper introduces a framework: Emergence Analysis based on Multi-Agent Intention (EAMI), which enables dynamic and interpretable emergence analysis. EAMI first employs a dual-perspective thought track mechanism, where an Inspector Agent and an Analysis Agent extract agent intentions under bounded and perfect rationality. Then, k-means clustering identifies phase transition points in group intentions, followed by a Intention Temporal Emergence diagram for dynamic analysis. The experiments validate EAMI in complex online-to-offline (O2O) service system and the Stanford AI Town experiment, with ablation studies confirming its effectiveness, generalizability, and efficiency. This framework provides a novel paradigm for abnormal emergence and causal analysis in service ecosystems. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EAMI-B085.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (TAI) has emerged as a critical objective in the deployment of AI systems across sensitive and high-risk domains. TAI frameworks articulate a comprehensive set of ethical, legal, and technical requirements to ensure that AI technologies are aligned with human values, rights, and societal expectations. Among the various AI paradigms, Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising solution to pressing privacy concerns. However, aligning FL with the rest of the requirements of TAI presents a series of challenges, most of which arise from its inherently distributed nature. In this work, we adopt the requirements TAI as a guiding structure to systematically analyze the challenges of adapting FL to TAI. Specifically, we classify and examine the key obstacles to aligning FL with TAI, providing a detailed exploration of what has been done, the trends, and the remaining work within each of the identified challenges.

Abstract: We consider identifying a conditional causal effect when a graph is known up to a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG). An MPDAG represents an equivalence class of graphs that is restricted by background knowledge and where all variables in the causal model are observed. We provide three results that address identification in this setting: an identification formula when the conditioning set is unaffected by treatment, a generalization of the well-known do calculus to the MPDAG setting, and an algorithm that is complete for identifying these conditional effects.

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive chain-of-thought generation, yet exhibit significant computational inefficiency by applying uniform reasoning strategies regardless of problem complexity. We present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets, aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration diversity.

<title>The Other Mind: How Language Models Exhibit Human Temporal Cognition</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain cognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified in training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on temporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find that larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference point and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance logarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To uncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses across neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify a set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits minimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a logarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing representations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where years evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal orientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we found that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear temporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal construction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for understanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a subjective construction of the external world by its internal representational system. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien cognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a direction for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

<title>Generating executable oracles to check conformance of client code to requirements of JDK Javadocs using LLMs</title>

Abstract: Software testing remains the most widely used methodology for validating quality of code. However, effectiveness of testing critically depends on the quality of test suites used. Test cases in a test suite consist of two fundamental parts: (1) input values for the code under test, and (2) correct checks for the outputs it produces. These checks are commonly written as assertions, and termed test oracles. The last couple of decades have seen much progress in automated test input generation, e.g., using fuzzing and symbolic execution. However, automating test oracles remains a relatively less explored problem area. Indeed, a test oracle by its nature requires knowledge of expected behavior, which may only be known to the developer and may not not exist in a formal language that supports automated reasoning.
  Our focus in this paper is automation of test oracles for clients of widely used Java libraries, e.g., java.lang and java.util packages. Our key insight is that Javadocs that provide a rich source of information can enable automated generation of test oracles. Javadocs of the core Java libraries are fairly detailed documents that contain natural language descriptions of not only how the libraries behave but also how the clients must (not) use them. We use large language models as an enabling technology to embody our insight into a framework for test oracle automation, and evaluate it experimentally. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs can generate oracles for checking normal and exceptional behaviors from Javadocs, with 98.8% of these oracles being compilable and 96.4% accurately reflecting intended properties. Even for the few incorrect oracles, errors are minor and can be easily corrected with the help of additional comment information generated by the LLMs.

Abstract: Declarative specifications have a vital role to play in developing safe and dependable software systems. Writing specifications correctly, however, remains particularly challenging. This paper presents a controlled experiment on using large language models (LLMs) to write declarative formulas in the well-known language Alloy. Our use of LLMs is three-fold. One, we employ LLMs to write complete Alloy formulas from given natural language descriptions (in English). Two, we employ LLMs to create alternative but equivalent formulas in Alloy with respect to given Alloy formulas. Three, we employ LLMs to complete sketches of Alloy formulas and populate the holes in the sketches by synthesizing Alloy expressions and operators so that the completed formulas accurately represent the desired properties (that are given in natural language). We conduct the experimental evaluation using 11 well-studied subject specifications and employ two popular LLMs, namely ChatGPT and DeepSeek. The experimental results show that the LLMs generally perform well in synthesizing complete Alloy formulas from input properties given in natural language or in Alloy, and are able to enumerate multiple unique solutions. Moreover, the LLMs are also successful at completing given sketches of Alloy formulas with respect to natural language descriptions of desired properties (without requiring test cases). We believe LLMs offer a very exciting advance in our ability to write specifications, and can help make specifications take a pivotal role in software development and enhance our ability to build robust software.

Abstract: Generative AI offers potential for educational support, but often lacks pedagogical grounding and awareness of the student's learning context. Furthermore, researching student interactions with these tools within authentic learning environments remains challenging. To address this, we present JELAI, an open-source platform architecture designed to integrate fine-grained Learning Analytics (LA) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based tutoring directly within a Jupyter Notebook environment. JELAI employs a modular, containerized design featuring JupyterLab extensions for telemetry and chat, alongside a central middleware handling LA processing and context-aware LLM prompt enrichment. This architecture enables the capture of integrated code interaction and chat data, facilitating real-time, context-sensitive AI scaffolding and research into student behaviour. We describe the system's design, implementation, and demonstrate its feasibility through system performance benchmarks and two proof-of-concept use cases illustrating its capabilities for logging multi-modal data, analysing help-seeking patterns, and supporting A/B testing of AI configurations. JELAI's primary contribution is its technical framework, providing a flexible tool for researchers and educators to develop, deploy, and study LA-informed AI tutoring within the widely used Jupyter ecosystem.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

Abstract: Model-based seismic inversion is a key technique in reservoir characterization, but traditional methods face significant limitations, such as relying on 1D average stationary wavelets and assuming an unrealistic lateral resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a Geophysics-Informed Neural Network (GINN) that integrates deep learning with seismic modeling. This novel approach employs a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to simultaneously estimate Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and acoustic impedance (IP). PSFs are divided into zero-phase and residual components to ensure geophysical consistency and to capture fine details. We used synthetic data from the SEAM Phase I Earth Model to train the GINN for 100 epochs (approximately 20 minutes) using a 2D UNet architecture. The network's inputs include positional features and a low-frequency impedance (LF-IP) model. A self-supervised loss function combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) was employed to ensure accurate results. The GINN demonstrated its ability to generate high-resolution IP and realistic PSFs, aligning with expected geological features. Unlike traditional 1D wavelets, the GINN produces PSFs with limited lateral resolution, reducing noise and improving accuracy. Future work will aim to refine the training process and validate the methodology with real seismic data.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique widely used in brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications, yet existing EEG foundation models face limitations in modeling spatio-temporal brain dynamics and lack channel permutation equivariance, preventing robust generalization across diverse electrode configurations. To address these challenges, we propose DIVER-0, a novel EEG foundation model that demonstrates how full spatio-temporal attention-rather than segregated spatial or temporal processing-achieves superior performance when properly designed with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for temporal relationships and binary attention biases for channel differentiation. We also introduce Sliding Temporal Conditional Positional Encoding (STCPE), which improves upon existing conditional positional encoding approaches by maintaining both temporal translation equivariance and channel permutation equivariance, enabling robust adaptation to arbitrary electrode configurations unseen during pretraining. Experimental results demonstrate that DIVER-0 achieves competitive performance with only 10% of pretraining data while maintaining consistent results across all channel permutation conditions, validating its effectiveness for cross-dataset generalization and establishing key design principles for handling the inherent heterogeneity of neural recording setups.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale machine learning models trained on extensive, diverse datasets that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. In the last two years, interest in FMs has also grown for applications in the cardiological field to analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. One of the key properties of FMs is their transferability to a wide range of downstream scenarios. With the spread of wearable and portable devices, keen interest in learning from reduced-channel configurations has arisen. However, the adaptation of ECG FMs to downstream scenarios with fewer available channels still has to be properly investigated. In this work, we propose Self-DANA, a novel, easy-to-integrate solution that makes self-supervised architectures adaptable to a reduced number of input channels, ensuring resource efficiency and high performance. We also introduce Random Lead Selection, a novel augmentation technique to pre-train models in a more robust and channel-agnostic way. Our experimental results on five reduced-channel configurations demonstrate that Self-DANA significantly enhances resource efficiency while reaching state-of-the-art performance. It requires up to 69.3% less peak CPU memory, 34.4% less peak GPU memory, about 17% less average epoch CPU time, and about 24% less average epoch GPU time.

Initial analysis of sEMG data from five PD patients and five healthy controls revealed significant neuromuscular differences. A traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved up to 83% accuracy, while enhancements with a Graph Convolutional Network-Support Vector Machine (GCN-SVM) model increased accuracy to 92%. Despite the preliminary nature of these results, the study outlines a detailed experimental methodology for future research with larger cohorts to validate these findings and integrate the approach into clinical practice. The proposed approach holds promise for advancing PD severity assessment and improving patient care in Parkinson's disease management.

Abstract: The recent breakthrough of AlphaFold3 in modeling complex biomolecular interactions, including those between proteins and ligands, nucleotides, or metal ions, creates new opportunities for protein design. In so-called inverse protein folding, the objective is to find a sequence of amino acids that adopts a target protein structure. Many inverse folding methods struggle to predict sequences for complexes that contain non-protein components, and perform poorly with complexes that adopt multiple structural states. To address these challenges, we present ADFLIP (All-atom Discrete FLow matching Inverse Protein folding), a generative model based on discrete flow-matching for designing protein sequences conditioned on all-atom structural contexts. ADFLIP progressively incorporates predicted amino acid side chains as structural context during sequence generation and enables the design of dynamic protein complexes through ensemble sampling across multiple structural states. Furthermore, ADFLIP implements training-free classifier guidance sampling, which allows the incorporation of arbitrary pre-trained models to optimise the designed sequence for desired protein properties. We evaluated the performance of ADFLIP on protein complexes with small-molecule ligands, nucleotides, or metal ions, including dynamic complexes for which structure ensembles were determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-structure and multi-structure inverse folding tasks, demonstrating excellent potential for all-atom protein design. The code is available at https://github.com/ykiiiiii/ADFLIP.

Abstract: In the field of cardiac electrophysiology (EP), effectively reducing noise in intra-cardiac signals is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. However, traditional noise reduction techniques fall short in addressing the diverse noise patterns from various sources, often non-linear and non-stationary, present in these signals. This work introduces a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, aimed at improving the quality of intra-ventricular monophasic action potential (MAP) signal recordings. By constructing representations of clean signals from a dataset of 5706 time series from 42 patients diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy, our approach demonstrates superior denoising performance when compared to conventional filtering methods commonly employed in clinical settings. We assess the effectiveness of our VAE model using various metrics, indicating its superior capability to denoise signals across different noise types, including time-varying non-linear noise frequently found in clinical settings. These results reveal that VAEs can eliminate diverse sources of noise in single beats, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising techniques and potentially improving treatment efficacy in cardiac EP.

<title>Catalyst: a Novel Regularizer for Structured Pruning with Auxiliary Extension of Parameter Space</title>

Abstract: Structured pruning aims to reduce the size and computational cost of deep neural networks by removing entire filters or channels. The traditional regularizers such as L1 or Group Lasso and its variants lead to magnitude-biased pruning decisions, such that the filters with small magnitudes are likely to be pruned. Also, they often entail pruning results with almost zero margin around pruning decision boundary, such that tiny perturbation in a filter magnitude can flip the pruning decision. In this paper, we identify the precise algebraic condition under which pruning operations preserve model performance, and use the condition to construct a novel regularizer defined in an extended parameter space via auxiliary catalyst variables. The proposed Catalyst regularization ensures fair pruning chance for each filters with theoretically provable zero bias to their magnitude and robust pruning behavior achieved by wide-margin bifurcation of magnitudes between the preserved and the pruned filters. The theoretical properties naturally lead to real-world effectiveness, as shown by empirical validations of Catalyst Pruning algorithm. Pruning results on various datasets and models are superior to state-of-the-art filter pruning methods, and at the same time confirm the predicted robust and fair pruning characteristics of Catalyst pruning.

<title>IPPRO: Importance-based Pruning with PRojective Offset for Magnitude-indifferent Structural Pruning</title>

Abstract: With the growth of demand on neural network compression methods, the structured pruning methods including importance-based approach are actively studied. The magnitude importance and many correlated modern importance criteria often limit the capacity of pruning decision, since the filters with larger magnitudes are not likely to be pruned if the smaller one didn't, even if it is redundant. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning strategy to challenge this dominating effect of magnitude and provide fair chance to each filter to be pruned, by placing it on projective space. After that, we observe the gradient descent movement whether the filters move toward the origin or not, to measure how the filter is likely to be pruned. This measurement is used to construct PROscore, a novel importance score for IPPRO, a novel importance-based structured pruning with magnitude-indifference. Our evaluation results shows that the proposed importance criteria using the projective space achieves near-lossless pruning by reducing the performance drop in pruning, with promising performance after the finetuning. Our work debunks the ``size-matters'' myth in pruning and expands the frontier of importance-based pruning both theoretically and empirically.

<title>Self-Improving Language Models for Evolutionary Program Synthesis: A Case Study on ARC-AGI</title>

arXiv:2507.14172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many program synthesis tasks prove too challenging for even state-of-the-art language models to solve in single attempts. Search-based evolutionary methods offer a promising alternative by exploring solution spaces iteratively, but their effectiveness remain limited by the fixed capabilities of the underlying generative model.
  We propose SOAR, a method that learns program synthesis by integrating language models into a self-improving evolutionary loop.
  SOAR alternates between (1) an evolutionary search that uses an LLM to sample and refine candidate solutions, and (2) a hindsight learning phase that converts search attempts into valid problem-solution pairs used to fine-tune the LLM's sampling and refinement capabilities\, -- \,enabling increasingly effective search in subsequent iterations.
  On the challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, SOAR achieves significant performance gains across model scales and iterations, leveraging positive transfer between the sampling and refinement finetuning tasks. These improvements carry over to test-time adaptation, enabling SOAR to solve 52\% of the public test set. Our code is open-sourced at: https://github.com/flowersteam/SOAR

<title>Latent Space Data Fusion Outperforms Early Fusion in Multimodal Mental Health Digital Phenotyping Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14175</link>

Abstract: Background: Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety require improved methods for early detection and personalized intervention. Traditional predictive models often rely on unimodal data or early fusion strategies that fail to capture the complex, multimodal nature of psychiatric data. Advanced integration techniques, such as intermediate (latent space) fusion, may offer better accuracy and clinical utility. Methods: Using data from the BRIGHTEN clinical trial, we evaluated intermediate (latent space) fusion for predicting daily depressive symptoms (PHQ-2 scores). We compared early fusion implemented with a Random Forest (RF) model and intermediate fusion implemented via a Combined Model (CM) using autoencoders and a neural network. The dataset included behavioral (smartphone-based), demographic, and clinical features. Experiments were conducted across multiple temporal splits and data stream combinations. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and coefficient of determination (R2). Results: The CM outperformed both RF and Linear Regression (LR) baselines across all setups, achieving lower MSE (0.4985 vs. 0.5305 with RF) and higher R2 (0.4695 vs. 0.4356). The RF model showed signs of overfitting, with a large gap between training and test performance, while the CM maintained consistent generalization. Performance was best when integrating all data modalities in the CM (in contradistinction to RF), underscoring the value of latent space fusion for capturing non-linear interactions in complex psychiatric datasets. Conclusion: Latent space fusion offers a robust alternative to traditional fusion methods for prediction with multimodal mental health data. Future work should explore model interpretability and individual-level prediction for clinical deployment.

Abstract: This paper aims to understand the training solution, which is obtained by the back-propagation algorithm, of two-layer neural networks whose hidden layer is composed of the units with smooth activation functions, including the usual sigmoid type most commonly used before the advent of ReLUs. The mechanism contains four main principles: construction of Taylor series expansions, strict partial order of knots, smooth-spline implementation and smooth-continuity restriction. The universal approximation for arbitrary input dimensionality is proved and experimental verification is given, through which the mystery of ``black box'' of the solution space is largely revealed. The new proofs employed also enrich approximation theory.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical to ensuring the reliability of deep learning applications and has attracted significant attention in recent years. A rich body of literature has emerged to develop efficient score functions that assign high scores to in-distribution (ID) samples and low scores to OOD samples, thereby helping distinguish OOD samples. Among these methods, distance-based score functions are widely used because of their efficiency and ease of use. However, deep learning often leads to a biased distribution of data features, and extreme features are inevitable. These extreme features make the distance-based methods tend to assign too low scores to ID samples. This limits the OOD detection capabilities of such methods. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Feature Bank Enhancement (FBE), that uses statistical characteristics from dataset to identify and constrain extreme features to the separation boundaries, therapy making the distance between samples inside and outside the distribution farther. We conducted experiments on large-scale ImageNet-1k and CIFAR-10 respectively, and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmark. Additionally, theoretical analysis and supplementary experiments are conducted to provide more insights into our method.

<title>A Sparsity Predicting Approach for Large Language Models via Activation Pattern Clustering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14179</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, where only a subset of neurons are active for a given input. Although this sparsity presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently, we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids. We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for efficient inference in large-scale language models.

<title>Digital Twin-Assisted Explainable AI for Robust Beam Prediction in mmWave MIMO Systems</title>

Abstract: In line with the AI-native 6G vision, explainability and robustness are crucial for building trust and ensuring reliable performance in millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. Efficient beam alignment is essential for initial access, but deep learning (DL) solutions face challenges, including high data collection overhead, hardware constraints, lack of explainability, and susceptibility to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a robust and explainable DL-based beam alignment engine (BAE) for mmWave multiple-input multiple output (MIMO) systems. The BAE uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements from wide beams to predict the best narrow beam, reducing the overhead of exhaustive beam sweeping. To overcome the challenge of real-world data collection, this work leverages a site-specific digital twin (DT) to generate synthetic channel data closely resembling real-world environments. A model refinement via transfer learning is proposed to fine-tune the pre-trained model residing in the DT with minimal real-world data, effectively bridging mismatches between the digital replica and real-world environments. To reduce beam training overhead and enhance transparency, the framework uses deep Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) to rank input features by importance, prioritizing key spatial directions and minimizing beam sweeping. It also incorporates the Deep k-nearest neighbors (DkNN) algorithm, providing a credibility metric for detecting out-of-distribution inputs and ensuring robust, transparent decision-making. Experimental results show that the proposed framework reduces real-world data needs by 70%, beam training overhead by 62%, and improves outlier detection robustness by up to 8.5x, achieving near-optimal spectral efficiency and transparent decision making compared to traditional softmax based DL models.

<title>Semi-Supervised Federated Learning via Dual Contrastive Learning and Soft Labeling for Intelligent Fault Diagnosis</title>

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis (IFD) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial machinery and improving production efficiency. However, traditional supervised deep learning methods require a large amount of training data and labels, which are often located in different clients. Additionally, the cost of data labeling is high, making labels difficult to acquire. Meanwhile, differences in data distribution among clients may also hinder the model's performance. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a semi-supervised federated learning framework, SSFL-DCSL, which integrates dual contrastive loss and soft labeling to address data and label scarcity for distributed clients with few labeled samples while safeguarding user privacy. It enables representation learning using unlabeled data on the client side and facilitates joint learning among clients through prototypes, thereby achieving mutual knowledge sharing and preventing local model divergence. Specifically, first, a sample weighting function based on the Laplace distribution is designed to alleviate bias caused by low confidence in pseudo labels during the semi-supervised training process. Second, a dual contrastive loss is introduced to mitigate model divergence caused by different data distributions, comprising local contrastive loss and global contrastive loss. Third, local prototypes are aggregated on the server with weighted averaging and updated with momentum to share knowledge among clients. To evaluate the proposed SSFL-DCSL framework, experiments are conducted on two publicly available datasets and a dataset collected on motors from the factory. In the most challenging task, where only 10\% of the data are labeled, the proposed SSFL-DCSL can improve accuracy by 1.15% to 7.85% over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Financial markets exhibit highly dynamic and complex behaviors shaped by both historical price trajectories and exogenous narratives, such as news, policy interpretations, and social media sentiment. The heterogeneity in these data and the diverse insight of investors introduce biases that complicate the modeling of market dynamics. Unlike prior work, this paper explores the potential of bull and bear regimes in investor-driven market dynamics. Through empirical analysis on real-world financial datasets, we uncover a dynamic relationship between bias variation and behavioral adaptation, which enhances trend prediction under evolving market conditions. To model this mechanism, we propose the Bias to Behavior from Bull-Bear Dynamics model (B4), a unified framework that jointly embeds temporal price sequences and external contextual signals into a shared latent space where opposing bull and bear forces naturally emerge, forming the foundation for bias representation. Within this space, an inertial pairing module pairs temporally adjacent samples to preserve momentum, while the dual competition mechanism contrasts bullish and bearish embeddings to capture behavioral divergence. Together, these components allow B4 to model bias-driven asymmetry, behavioral inertia, and market heterogeneity. Experimental results on real-world financial datasets demonstrate that our model not only achieves superior performance in predicting market trends but also provides interpretable insights into the interplay of biases, investor behaviors, and market dynamics.

Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram (ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with learnable neural encoding. Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles. The core of our design is a neural-distilled HDC architecture, featuring a learnable RR-block encoder and a BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving 73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable and personalized health monitoring.

Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy has underscored the significance of Low-Altitude Network Coverage (LANC) prediction for designing aerial corridors. While accurate LANC forecasting hinges on the antenna beam patterns of Base Stations (BSs), these patterns are typically proprietary and not readily accessible. Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam information, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage prediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is cost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity results in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited variability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of substantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished generalizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based feature compression and disentangled representation learning. The former reduces feature space complexity by leveraging communications expertise, while the latter enhances model generalizability through the integration of propagation models and distinct subnetworks that capture and aggregate the semantic representations of latent features. Experimental evaluation confirms the efficacy of our framework, yielding a 7% reduction in error compared to the best baseline algorithm. Real-network validations further attest to its reliability, achieving practical prediction accuracy with MAE errors at the 5dB level.

Abstract: The impedance network (IN) model is gaining popularity in the oscillation analysis of wind farms. However, the construction of such an IN model requires impedance curves of each wind turbine under their respective operating conditions, making its online application difficult due to the transmission of numerous high-density impedance curves. To address this issue, this paper proposes an AI-based impedance encoding-decoding method to facilitate the online construction of IN model. First, an impedance encoder is trained to compress impedance curves by setting the number of neurons much smaller than that of frequency points. Then, the compressed data of each turbine are uploaded to the wind farm and an impedance decoder is trained to reconstruct original impedance curves. At last, based on the nodal admittance matrix (NAM) method, the IN model of the wind farm can be obtained. The proposed method is validated via model training and real-time simulations, demonstrating that the encoded impedance vectors enable fast transmission and accurate reconstruction of the original impedance curves.

Abstract: In 2023, satellite and mobile networks crossed a historic threshold: standard smartphones, using unmodified 3GPP protocols, connected directly to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. This first wave of direct-to-device (D2D) demonstrations validated the physical feasibility of satellite-based mobile access. However, these systems remain fallback-grade--rural-only, bandwidth-limited, and fully dependent on Earth-based mobile cores for identity, session, and policy control. This paper asks a more ambitious question: Can a complete mobile network, including radio access, core functions, traffic routing, and content delivery, operate entirely from orbit? And can it deliver sustained, urban-grade service in the world's densest cities? We present the first end-to-end system architecture for a fully orbital telco, integrating electronically steered phased arrays with 1000-beam capacity, space-based deployment of 5G core functions (UPF, AMF), and inter-satellite laser mesh backhaul. We analyze spectral efficiency, beam capacity, and link budgets under dense urban conditions, accounting for path loss, Doppler, and multipath. Simulations show that rooftop and line-of-sight users can sustain 64-QAM throughput, while street-level access is feasible with relay or assisted beam modes. The paper outlines the remaining constraints, power, thermal dissipation, compute radiation hardening, and regulatory models, and demonstrates that these are engineering bottlenecks, not physical limits. Finally, we propose a staged 15-year roadmap from today's fallback D2D systems to autonomous orbital overlays delivering 50-100 Mbps to handhelds in megacities, with zero reliance on terrestrial infrastructure.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various applications. However, their use as writing assistants in specialized domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality, verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and generated content quality.

Abstract: Regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, encourage openness of general-purpose AI models by offering legal exemptions for "open-source" models. Despite this legislative attention on openness, the definition of open-source foundation models remains ambiguous. This paper models the strategic interactions among the creator of a general-purpose model (the generalist) and the entity that fine-tunes the general-purpose model to a specialized domain or task (the specialist), in response to regulatory requirements on model openness. We present a stylized model of the regulator's choice of an open-source definition to evaluate which AI openness standards will establish appropriate economic incentives for developers. Our results characterize market equilibria -- specifically, upstream model release decisions and downstream fine-tuning efforts -- under various openness regulations and present a range of effective regulatory penalties and open-source thresholds. Overall, we find the model's baseline performance determines when increasing the regulatory penalty vs. the open-source threshold will significantly alter the generalist's release strategy. Our model provides a theoretical foundation for AI governance decisions around openness and enables evaluation and refinement of practical open-source policies.

Abstract: Radar technology presents untapped potential for continuous, contactless, and passive heart rate monitoring via consumer electronics like mobile phones. However the variety of available radar systems and lack of standardization means that a large new paired dataset collection is required for each radar system. This study demonstrates transfer learning between frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar systems, both increasingly integrated into consumer devices. FMCW radar utilizes a continuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW radar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3 receiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz bandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119 participants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained performance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate ranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model, trained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376, avg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach yielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE reduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning between radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate its introduction into existing consumer devices.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Differentiating wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is clinically critical yet challenging due to morphological similarities in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals between life-threatening ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SVT-A). Misdiagnosis carries fatal risks. We propose a computationally efficient deep learning solution to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide model interpretability for clinical deployment.
  Methods: A novel lightweight parallel deep architecture is introduced. Each pipeline processes individual ECG leads using two 1D-CNN blocks to extract local features. Feature maps are concatenated across leads, followed by LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies. Final classification employs fully connected layers. Explainability is achieved via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for local/global interpretation. The model was evaluated on a 35-subject ECG database using standard performance metrics.
  Results: The model achieved $95.63\%$ accuracy ($95\%$ CI: $93.07-98.19\%$), with sensitivity=$95.10\%$, specificity=$96.06\%$, and F1-score=$95.12\%$. It outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring minimal CNN blocks per pipeline. SHAP analysis demonstrated clinically interpretable feature contributions.
  Conclusions: Our end-to-end framework delivers high-precision WCT classification with minimal computational overhead. The integration of SHAP enhances clinical trust by elucidating decision logic, supporting rapid, informed diagnosis. This approach shows significant promise for real-world ECG analysis tools.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training. In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods might be made more robust.

<title>Open-Source LLMs Collaboration Beats Closed-Source LLMs: A Scalable Multi-Agent System</title>

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this, we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025, e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%) across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence. Code will be released at https://github.com/magent4aci/SMACS.

Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is 0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future research. Code and data are coming soon!

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse applications, yet they pose significant security risks that threaten their safe deployment in critical domains. Current security alignment methodologies predominantly rely on Process Reward Models (PRMs) to evaluate intermediate reasoning steps, introducing substantial computational overhead and scalability constraints. This paper presents a novel PRM-free security alignment framework that leverages automated red teaming and adversarial training to achieve robust security guarantees while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach systematically identifies vulnerabilities through sophisticated attack strategies including genetic algorithm optimization, multi-agent simulation, and advanced prompt mutation techniques. The framework enhances model robustness via targeted adversarial training with curriculum learning and adaptive regularization mechanisms. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across five state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrates that our method achieves superior security alignment performance compared to PRM-based approaches while reducing computational costs by 61\%. The framework incorporates transparent reporting and continuous audit mechanisms that enable iterative security improvement and regulatory compliance. Our contributions advance the field of efficient LLM security alignment by democratizing access to robust security measures for resource-constrained organizations and providing a scalable foundation for addressing evolving adversarial threats.

<title>LaCache: Ladder-Shaped KV Caching for Efficient Long-Context Modeling of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/GATECH-EIC/LaCache.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram~(ECG), a key bioelectrical time-series signal, is crucial for assessing cardiac health and diagnosing various diseases. Given its time-series format, ECG data is often incorporated into pre-training datasets for large-scale time-series model training. However, existing studies often overlook its unique characteristics and specialized downstream applications, which differ significantly from other time-series data, leading to an incomplete understanding of its properties. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of ECG signals and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which includes (1) categorizing its downstream applications into four distinct evaluation tasks, (2) identifying limitations in traditional evaluation metrics for ECG analysis, and introducing a novel metric; (3) benchmarking state-of-the-art time-series models and proposing a new architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed benchmark is comprehensive and robust. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and model architecture, which establish a solid foundation for advancing research in ECG signal analysis.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in K--12 education offers both transformative opportunities and emerging risks. This study explores how students may Trojanize prompts to elicit unsafe or unintended outputs from LLMs, bypassing established content moderation systems with safety guardrils. Through a systematic experiment involving simulated K--12 queries and multi-turn dialogues, we expose key vulnerabilities in GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. This paper presents our experimental design, detailed findings, and a prototype tool, TrojanPromptGuard (TPG), to automatically detect and mitigate Trojanized educational prompts. These insights aim to inform both AI safety researchers and educational technologists on the safe deployment of LLMs for educators.

<title>PRATA: A Framework to Enable Predictive QoS in Vehicular Networks via Artificial Intelligence</title>

arXiv:2507.14211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive Quality of Service (PQoS) makes it possible to anticipate QoS changes, e.g., in wireless networks, and trigger appropriate countermeasures to avoid performance degradation. Hence, PQoS is extremely useful for automotive applications such as teleoperated driving, which poses strict constraints in terms of latency and reliability. A promising tool for PQoS is given by Reinforcement Learning (RL), a methodology that enables the design of decision-making strategies for stochastic optimization. In this manuscript, we present PRATA, a new simulation framework to enable PRedictive QoS based on AI for Teleoperated driving Applications. PRATA consists of a modular pipeline that includes (i) an end-to-end protocol stack to simulate the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN), (ii) a tool for generating automotive data, and (iii) an Artificial Intelligence (AI) unit to optimize PQoS decisions. To prove its utility, we use PRATA to design an RL unit, named RAN-AI, to optimize the segmentation level of teleoperated driving data in the event of resource saturation or channel degradation. Hence, we show that the RAN-AI entity efficiently balances the trade-off between QoS and Quality of Experience (QoE) that characterize teleoperated driving applications, almost doubling the system performance compared to baseline approaches. In addition, by varying the learning settings of the RAN-AI entity, we investigate the impact of the state space and the relative cost of acquiring network data that are necessary for the implementation of RL.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence functions not as an epistemic leveller, but as an accelerant of cognitive stratification, entrenching and formalising informational castes within liberal-democratic societies. Synthesising formal epistemology, political theory, algorithmic architecture, and economic incentive structures, the argument traces how contemporary AI systems selectively amplify the reasoning capacity of individuals equipped with recursive abstraction, symbolic logic, and adversarial interrogation, whilst simultaneously pacifying the cognitively untrained through engagement-optimised interfaces. Fluency replaces rigour, immediacy displaces reflection, and procedural reasoning is eclipsed by reactive suggestion. The result is a technocratic realignment of power: no longer grounded in material capital alone, but in the capacity to navigate, deconstruct, and manipulate systems of epistemic production. Information ceases to be a commons; it becomes the substrate through which consent is manufactured and autonomy subdued. Deliberative democracy collapses not through censorship, but through the erosion of interpretive agency. The proposed response is not technocratic regulation, nor universal access, but the reconstruction of rational autonomy as a civic mandate, codified in education, protected by epistemic rights, and structurally embedded within open cognitive infrastructure.

<title>Artificial Intelligence for Green Hydrogen Yield Prediction and Site Suitability using SHAP-Based Composite Index: Focus on Oman</title>

Abstract: As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering, supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively. Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.

Abstract: Explainable intrusion detection systems (IDS) are now recognized as essential for mission-critical networks, yet most "XAI" pipelines still bolt an approximate explainer onto an opaque classifier, leaving analysts with partial and sometimes misleading insights. The Interpretable Generalization (IG) mechanism, published in IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security, eliminates that bottleneck by learning coherent patterns - feature combinations unique to benign or malicious traffic - and turning them into fully auditable rules. IG already delivers outstanding precision, recall, and AUC on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and UKM-IDS20, even when trained on only 10% of the data. To raise precision further without sacrificing transparency, we introduce Multi-Granular Discretization (IG-MD), which represents every continuous feature at several Gaussian-based resolutions. On UKM-IDS20, IG-MD lifts precision by greater than or equal to 4 percentage points across all nine train-test splits while preserving recall approximately equal to 1.0, demonstrating that a single interpretation-ready model can scale across domains without bespoke tuning.

<title>Domain Generalization via Pareto Optimal Gradient Matching</title>

Abstract: In this study, we address the gradient-based domain generalization problem, where predictors aim for consistent gradient directions across different domains. Existing methods have two main challenges. First, minimization of gradient empirical distance or gradient inner products (GIP) leads to gradient fluctuations among domains, thereby hindering straightforward learning. Second, the direct application of gradient learning to the joint loss function can incur high computation overheads due to second-order derivative approximation. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new Pareto Optimality Gradient Matching (POGM) method. In contrast to existing methods that add gradient matching as regularization, we leverage gradient trajectories as collected data and apply independent training at the meta-learner. In the meta-update, we maximize GIP while limiting the learned gradient from deviating too far from the empirical risk minimization gradient trajectory. By doing so, the aggregate gradient can incorporate knowledge from all domains without suffering gradient fluctuation towards any particular domain. Experimental evaluations on datasets from DomainBed demonstrate competitive results yielded by POGM against other baselines while achieving computational efficiency.

Abstract: Advanced intelligent automation becomes an important feature to deal with the increased complexity in managing wireless networks. This paper proposes a novel automation approach of intent-based network for Radio Access Networks (RANs) management by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed method enhances intent translation, autonomously interpreting high-level objectives, reasoning over complex network states, and generating precise configurations of the RAN by integrating LLMs within an agentic architecture. We propose a structured prompt engineering technique and demonstrate that the network can automatically improve its energy efficiency by dynamically optimizing critical RAN parameters through a closed-loop mechanism. It showcases the potential to enable robust resource management in RAN by adapting strategies based on real-time feedback via LLM-orchestrated agentic systems.

Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to subtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced natural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar disorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA, DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized (BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study offers actionable insights for model selection in mental health NLP applications and validates the potential of contextualized language models to support early bipolar disorder screening.

Abstract: This paper explores the outcome of training state-ofthe-art dereverberation models with supervision settings ranging from weakly-supervised to fully unsupervised, relying solely on reverberant signals and an acoustic model for training. Most of the existing deep learning approaches typically require paired dry and reverberant data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. We develop instead a sequential learning strategy motivated by a bayesian formulation of the dereverberation problem, wherein acoustic parameters and dry signals are estimated from reverberant inputs using deep neural networks, guided by a reverberation matching loss. Our most data-efficient variant requires only 100 reverberation-parameter-labelled samples to outperform an unsupervised baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method in low-resource scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in user-facing applications, from providing medical consultations to job interview advice. Recent research suggests that these models are becoming increasingly proficient at inferring identity information about the author of a piece of text from linguistic patterns as subtle as the choice of a few words. However, little is known about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in real-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how identity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five different high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law, politics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are extremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race, gender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For instance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different standards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same symptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a conservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by older (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken together, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these applications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps, and create different political factual realities for people of different identities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for evaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts model decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend that similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are conducted before future deployment.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations, which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict sequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks, such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation. However, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying advanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets. This creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and datasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular platforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no sign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained models, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or malicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical to understand the origin and development of these components to better detect potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by this, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets, which are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to systematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a directed heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and datasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We then perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the LLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree distribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented periphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong interdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is dynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best with well-crafted prompts, yet prompt engineering remains manual, inconsistent, and inaccessible to non-experts. We introduce Promptomatix, an automatic prompt optimization framework that transforms natural language task descriptions into high-quality prompts without requiring manual tuning or domain expertise. Promptomatix supports both a lightweight meta-prompt-based optimizer and a DSPy-powered compiler, with modular design enabling future extension to more advanced frameworks. The system analyzes user intent, generates synthetic training data, selects prompting strategies, and refines prompts using cost-aware objectives. Evaluated across 5 task categories, Promptomatix achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing libraries, while reducing prompt length and computational overhead making prompt optimization scalable and efficient.

Abstract: While Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not a new field, recent developments, especially with the release of generative tools like ChatGPT, have brought it to the forefront of the minds of industry workers and academic folk alike. There is currently much talk about AI and its ability to reshape many everyday processes as we know them through automation. It also allows users to expand their ideas by suggesting things they may not have thought of on their own and provides easier access to information. However, not all of the changes this technology will bring or has brought so far are positive; this is why it is extremely important for all modern people to recognize and understand the risks before using these tools and allowing them to cause harm. This work takes a position on better understanding many equity concerns and the spread of misinformation that result from new AI, in this case, specifically ChatGPT and deepfakes, and encouraging collaboration with law enforcement, developers, and users to reduce harm. Considering many academic sources, it warns against these issues, analyzing their cause and impact in fields including healthcare, education, science, academia, retail, and finance. Lastly, we propose a set of future-facing guidelines and policy considerations to solve these issues while still enabling innovation in these fields, this responsibility falling upon users, developers, and government entities.

Abstract: Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex decision space where AI is poised to make a transformative impact. However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.

Abstract: Vision transformer (ViT) models, when coupled with interpretation models, are regarded as secure and challenging to deceive, making them well-suited for security-critical domains such as medical applications, autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotics. However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to severe consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily focuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive the models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model interpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively assist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the vulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined with interpretation models. We propose an attack called "AdViT" that generates adversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and its coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various transformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that AdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box scenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification confidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76% misclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate interpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more difficult to detect.

<title>Real-Time Communication-Aware Ride-Sharing Route Planning for Urban Air Mobility: A Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems are rapidly emerging as promising solutions to alleviate urban congestion, with path planning becoming a key focus area. Unlike ground transportation, UAM trajectory planning has to prioritize communication quality for accurate location tracking in constantly changing environments to ensure safety. Meanwhile, a UAM system, serving as an air taxi, requires adaptive planning to respond to real-time passenger requests, especially in ride-sharing scenarios where passenger demands are unpredictable and dynamic. However, conventional trajectory planning strategies based on predefined routes lack the flexibility to meet varied passenger ride demands. To address these challenges, this work first proposes constructing a radio map to evaluate the communication quality of urban airspace. Building on this, we introduce a novel Multi-Source Hybrid Attention Reinforcement Learning (MSHA-RL) framework for the challenge of effectively focusing on passengers and UAM locations, which arises from the significant dimensional disparity between the representations. This model first generates the alignment among diverse data sources with large gap dimensions before employing hybrid attention to balance global and local insights, thereby facilitating responsive, real-time path planning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the approach enables communication-compliant trajectory planning, reducing travel time and enhancing operational efficiency while prioritizing passenger safety.

<title>Impact of Code Context and Prompting Strategies on Automated Unit Test Generation with Modern General-Purpose Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Generative AI is gaining increasing attention in software engineering, where testing remains an indispensable reliability mechanism. According to the widely adopted testing pyramid, unit tests constitute the majority of test cases and are often schematic, requiring minimal domain expertise. Automatically generating such tests under the supervision of software engineers can significantly enhance productivity during the development phase of the software lifecycle.
  This paper investigates the impact of code context and prompting strategies on the quality and adequacy of unit tests generated by various large language models (LLMs) across several families. The results show that including docstrings notably improves code adequacy, while further extending context to the full implementation yields definitely smaller gains. Notably, the chain-of-thought prompting strategy -- applied even to 'reasoning' models -- achieves the best results, with up to 96.3\% branch coverage, a 57\% average mutation score, and near-perfect compilation success rate. Among the evaluated models, M5 (Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrated superior performance in both mutation score and branch coverage being still in top in terms of compilation success rate.

Abstract: We present Fast Approximate Minimum Spanning Tree (FAMST), a novel algorithm that addresses the computational challenges of constructing Minimum Spanning Trees (MSTs) for large-scale and high-dimensional datasets. FAMST utilizes a three-phase approach: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) graph construction, ANN inter-component connection, and iterative edge refinement. For a dataset of $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space, FAMST achieves $\mathcal{O}(dn \log n)$ time complexity and $\mathcal{O}(dn + kn)$ space complexity when $k$ nearest neighbors are considered, which is a significant improvement over the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ time and space complexity of traditional methods.
  Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that FAMST achieves remarkably low approximation errors while providing speedups of up to 1000$\times$ compared to exact MST algorithms. We analyze how the key hyperparameters, $k$ (neighborhood size) and $\lambda$ (inter-component edges), affect performance, providing practical guidelines for hyperparameter selection. FAMST enables MST-based analysis on datasets with millions of points and thousands of dimensions, extending the applicability of MST techniques to problem scales previously considered infeasible.

Abstract: The Internet is poised to host billions to trillions of autonomous AI agents that negotiate, delegate, and migrate in milliseconds and workloads that will strain DNS-centred identity and discovery. In this paper, we describe the NANDA index architecture, which we envision as a means for discoverability, identifiability and authentication in the internet of AI agents. We present an architecture where a minimal lean index resolves to dynamic, cryptographically verifiable AgentFacts that supports multi-endpoint routing, load balancing, privacy-preserving access, and credentialed capability assertions. Our architecture design delivers five concrete guarantees: (1) A quilt-like index proposal that supports both NANDA-native agents as well as third party agents being discoverable via the index, (2) rapid global resolution for newly spawned AI agents, (3) sub-second revocation and key rotation, (4) schema-validated capability assertions, and (5) privacy-preserving discovery across organisational boundaries via verifiable, least-disclosure queries. We formalize the AgentFacts schema, specify a CRDT-based update protocol, and prototype adaptive resolvers. The result is a lightweight, horizontally scalable foundation that unlocks secure, trust-aware collaboration for the next generation of the Internet of AI agents, without abandoning existing web infrastructure.

Abstract: Over the past decade, higher education has evolved through three distinct paradigms: the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), the integration of Smart Teaching technologies into classrooms, and the rise of AI-enhanced learning. Each paradigm is intended to address specific challenges in traditional education: MOOCs enable ubiquitous access to learning resources; Smart Teaching supports real-time interaction with data-driven insights; and generative AI offers personalized feedback and on-demand content generation. However, these paradigms are often implemented in isolation due to their disparate technological origins and policy-driven adoption. This paper examines the origins, strengths, and limitations of each paradigm, and advocates a unified pedagogical perspective that synthesizes their complementary affordances. We propose a three-layer instructional framework that combines the scalability of MOOCs, the responsiveness of Smart Teaching, and the adaptivity of AI. To demonstrate its feasibility, we present a curriculum design for a project-based course. The findings highlight the framework's potential to enhance learner engagement, support instructors, and enable personalized yet scalable learning.

Abstract: We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both computationally efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((\alpha_i + \tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters $\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69\% test accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

As several possible mitosis shapes exist, it is crucial to have a large dataset to cover all the cases. Accordingly, a total of 50 regions is selected from glass slides for 25 patients, each of regions with a size of 1024*1024 pixels. There are more than 500 mitoses in total in these 50 regions. Two-thirds of the regions are reserved for training, the other third for testing.

To carry out a consistent comparative analysis between the methods that will be developed using the NuSeC dataset by the researchers in the future, we divide the NuSeC dataset 75% as the training set and 25% as the testing set. In detail, an image is randomly selected from 4 images of each patient among 25 patients to build the testing set, and then the remaining images are reserved for the training set. While the training set includes 75 images with around 30000 nuclei structures, the testing set includes 25 images with around 6000 nuclei structures.

Abstract: Multi-turn problem solving is critical yet challenging for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) to reflect on their reasoning and revise from feedback. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods train large reasoning models on a single-turn paradigm with verifiable rewards. However, we observe that models trained with existing RL paradigms often lose their ability to solve problems across multiple turns and struggle to revise answers based on contextual feedback, leading to repetitive responses. We ask: can LRMs learn to reflect their answers in a multi-turn context? In this work, we find that training models with multi-turn RL using only unary feedback (e.g., "Let's try again") after wrong answers can improve both single-turn performance and multi-turn reasoning. We introduce Unary Feedback as Observation (UFO) for reinforcement learning, which uses minimal yet common unary user feedback during iterative problem solving. It can be easily applied to existing single-turn RL training setups. Experimental results show that RL training with UFO keeps single-turn performance and improves multi-turn reasoning accuracy by up to 14%, enabling language models to better react to feedback in multi-turn problem solving. To further minimize the number of turns needed for a correct answer while encouraging diverse reasoning when mistakes occur, we design reward structures that guide models to produce careful and deliberate answers in each turn.

Abstract: Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First, they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a wide range of chart types.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities are envisioned to play a pivotal role in future wireless networks due to their enhanced flexibility and efficiency. However, jointly optimizing UAV trajectory planning, multi-user communication, and target sensing under stringent resource constraints and time-critical conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an Age of Information (AoI)-centric UAV-ISAC system that simultaneously performs target sensing and serves multiple ground users, emphasizing information freshness as the core performance metric. We formulate a long-term average AoI minimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV's flight trajectory and beamforming. To tackle the high-dimensional, non-convexity of this problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm capable of providing real-time decisions on UAV movement and beamforming for both radar sensing and multi-user communication. Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed for accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to mitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is applied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed framework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and communication quality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves lower average AoI compared to baseline approaches.

Abstract: Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI, and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation. This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their potential without compromising self-determination.

Abstract: Language models are commonly fine-tuned via reinforcement learning to alter their behavior or elicit new capabilities. Datasets used for these purposes, and particularly human preference datasets, are often noisy. The relatively small size post-training datasets, combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, enable the use of influence functions approximations to detect and prune training examples that are harmful to performance on a validation set. In this work, we adapt the TL;DR dataset for reward model training to demonstrate how conjugate-gradient approximated influence functions can be used to filter datasets. In our experiments, influence function filtering yields a small retraining accuracy uplift of 1.5% after removing 10% of training examples. We also show that gradient similarity outperforms influence functions for detecting helpful training examples. This suggests that local curvature is important for detecting harmful training examples, but less so for identifying helpful examples.

Abstract: Recommender systems are known to exhibit fairness issues, particularly on the product side, where products and their associated suppliers receive unequal exposure in recommended results. While this problem has been widely studied in traditional recommendation settings, its implications for bundle recommendation (BR) remain largely unexplored. This emerging task introduces additional complexity: recommendations are generated at the bundle level, yet user satisfaction and product (or supplier) exposure depend on both the bundle and the individual items it contains. Existing fairness frameworks and metrics designed for traditional recommender systems may not directly translate to this multi-layered setting. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive reproducibility study of product-side fairness in BR across three real-world datasets using four state-of-the-art BR methods. We analyze exposure disparities at both the bundle and item levels using multiple fairness metrics, uncovering important patterns. Our results show that exposure patterns differ notably between bundles and items, revealing the need for fairness interventions that go beyond bundle-level assumptions. We also find that fairness assessments vary considerably depending on the metric used, reinforcing the need for multi-faceted evaluation. Furthermore, user behavior plays a critical role: when users interact more frequently with bundles than with individual items, BR systems tend to yield fairer exposure distributions across both levels. Overall, our findings offer actionable insights for building fairer bundle recommender systems and establish a vital foundation for future research in this emerging domain.

<title>Solo Connection: A Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Technique for Transformers</title>

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation, enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks, subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models has brought rapid progress on Text-to-SQL benchmarks, but it is not yet easy to build a working enterprise solution. In this paper, we present insights from building an internal chatbot that enables LinkedIn's product managers, engineers, and operations teams to self-serve data insights from a large, dynamic data lake. Our approach features three components. First, we construct a knowledge graph that captures up-to-date semantics by indexing database metadata, historical query logs, wikis, and code. We apply clustering to identify relevant tables for each team or product area. Second, we build a Text-to-SQL agent that retrieves and ranks context from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects hallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that supports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to debugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up chats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of its responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set. Through ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and modeling components, offering a practical path for developing enterprise Text-to-SQL solutions.

Abstract: Schema matching is essential for integrating heterogeneous data sources and enhancing dataset discovery, yet it remains a complex and resource-intensive problem. We introduce SCHEMORA, a schema matching framework that combines large language models with hybrid retrieval techniques in a prompt-based approach, enabling efficient identification of candidate matches without relying on labeled training data or exhaustive pairwise comparisons. By enriching schema metadata and leveraging both vector-based and lexical retrieval, SCHEMORA improves matching accuracy and scalability. Evaluated on the MIMIC-OMOP benchmark, it establishes new state-of-the-art performance, with gains of 7.49% in HitRate@5 and 3.75% in HitRate@3 over previous best results. To our knowledge, this is the first LLM-based schema matching method with an open-source implementation, accompanied by analysis that underscores the critical role of retrieval and provides practical guidance on model selection.

<title>Incremental Causal Graph Learning for Online Cyberattack Detection in Cyber-Physical Infrastructures</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14387</link>

Abstract: The escalating threat of cyberattacks on real-time critical infrastructures poses serious risks to public safety, demanding detection methods that effectively capture complex system interdependencies and adapt to evolving attack patterns. Traditional real-time anomaly detection techniques often suffer from excessive false positives due to their statistical sensitivity to high data variance and class imbalance. To address these limitations, recent research has explored modeling causal relationships among system components. However, prior work mainly focuses on offline causal graph-based approaches that require static historical data and fail to generalize to real-time settings. These methods are fundamentally constrained by: (1) their inability to adapt to dynamic shifts in data distribution without retraining, and (2) the risk of catastrophic forgetting when lacking timely supervision in live systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose INCADET, a novel framework for incremental causal graph learning tailored to real-time cyberattack detection. INCADET dynamically captures evolving system behavior by incrementally updating causal graphs across streaming time windows. The framework comprises three modules: 1) Early Symptom Detection: Detects transitions in system status using divergence in edge-weight distributions across sequential causal graphs. 2) Incremental Causal Graph Learning: Leverages experience replay and edge reinforcement to continually refine causal structures while preserving prior knowledge. 3) Causal Graph Classification: Employs Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to classify system status using the learned causal graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world critical infrastructure datasets demonstrate that INCADET achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability compared to both static causal and deep temporal baselines in evolving attack scenarios.

<title>Designing Conversational AI to Support Think-Aloud Practice in Technical Interview Preparation for CS Students</title>

Abstract: One challenge in technical interviews is the think-aloud process, where candidates verbalize their thought processes while solving coding tasks. Despite its importance, opportunities for structured practice remain limited. Conversational AI offers potential assistance, but limited research explores user perceptions of its role in think-aloud practice. To address this gap, we conducted a study with 17 participants using an LLM-based technical interview practice tool. Participants valued AI's role in simulation, feedback, and learning from generated examples. Key design recommendations include promoting social presence in conversational AI for technical interview simulation, providing feedback beyond verbal content analysis, and enabling crowdsourced think-aloud examples through human-AI collaboration. Beyond feature design, we examined broader considerations, including intersectional challenges and potential strategies to address them, how AI-driven interview preparation could promote equitable learning in computing careers, and the need to rethink AI's role in interview practice by suggesting a research direction that integrates human-AI collaboration.

<title>It's Not That Simple. An Analysis of Simple Test-Time Scaling</title>

Abstract: Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this scaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually controlling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum length or scaling up by iteratively appending "Wait" when the model is about to terminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time scaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling down by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data distilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior, and scaling up by appending "Wait" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may oscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by enforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models, such as DeepSeek-R1\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much compute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported length. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during reinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when scaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower upper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the test-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down, it is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to unlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve -- rather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.

Abstract: As a paradigm for sequential decision making in unknown environments, reinforcement learning (RL) has received a flurry of attention in recent years. However, the explosion of model complexity in emerging applications and the presence of nonconvexity exacerbate the challenge of achieving efficient RL in sample-starved situations, where data collection is expensive, time-consuming, or even high-stakes (e.g., in clinical trials, autonomous systems, and online advertising). How to understand and enhance the sample and computational efficacies of RL algorithms is thus of great interest. In this tutorial, we aim to introduce several important algorithmic and theoretical developments in RL, highlighting the connections between new ideas and classical topics. Employing Markov Decision Processes as the central mathematical model, we cover several distinctive RL scenarios (i.e., RL with a simulator, online RL, offline RL, robust RL, and RL with human feedback), and present several mainstream RL approaches (i.e., model-based approach, value-based approach, and policy optimization). Our discussions gravitate around the issues of sample complexity, computational efficiency, as well as algorithm-dependent and information-theoretic lower bounds from a non-asymptotic viewpoint.

Abstract: Reserve prices are widely used in practice. The problem of designing revenue-optimal auctions based on reserve price has drawn much attention in the auction design community. Although they have been extensively studied, most developments rely on the significant assumption that the target audience of the sale is directly reachable by the auctioneer, while a large portion of bidders in the economic network unaware of the sale are omitted. This work follows the diffusion auction design, which aims to extend the target audience of optimal auction theory to all entities in economic networks. We investigate the design of simple and provably near-optimal network auctions via reserve price. Using Bayesian approximation analysis, we provide a simple and explicit form of the reserve price function tailored to the most representative network auction. We aim to balance setting a sufficiently high reserve price to induce high revenue in a successful sale, and attracting more buyers from the network to increase the probability of a successful sale. This reserve price function preserves incentive compatibility for network auctions, allowing the seller to extract additional revenue beyond that achieved by the Myerson optimal auction. Specifically, if the seller has $\rho$ direct neighbours in a network of size $n$, this reserve price guarantees a $1-{1 \over \rho}$ approximation to the theoretical upper bound, i.e., the maximum possible revenue from any network of size $n$. This result holds for any size and any structure of the networked market.

<title>Strategyproofness and Monotone Allocation of Auction in Social Networks</title>

Abstract: Strategyproofness in network auctions requires that bidders not only report their valuations truthfully, but also do their best to invite neighbours from the social network. In contrast to canonical auctions, where the value-monotone allocation in Myerson's Lemma is a cornerstone, a general principle of allocation rules for strategyproof network auctions is still missing. We show that, due to the absence of such a principle, even extensions to multi-unit network auctions with single-unit demand present unexpected difficulties, and all pioneering researches fail to be strategyproof. For the first time in this field, we identify two categories of monotone allocation rules on networks: Invitation-Depressed Monotonicity (ID-MON) and Invitation-Promoted Monotonicity (IP-MON). They encompass all existing allocation rules of network auctions as specific instances. For any given ID-MON or IP-MON allocation rule, we characterize the existence and sufficient conditions for the strategyproof payment rules, and show that among all such payment rules, the revenue-maximizing one exists and is computationally feasible. With these results, the obstacle of combinatorial network auction with single-minded bidders is now resolved.

<title>DFQ-ViT: Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers without Fine-tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14481</link>

arXiv:2507.14481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers (ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT). Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty, effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Completing the whole 3D structure based on an incomplete point cloud is a challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning. However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability in handling sparse data and unseen categories.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.14499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural-Brownian Motion (NBM), a new class of stochastic processes for modeling dynamics under learned uncertainty. The NBM is defined axiomatically by replacing the classical martingale property with respect to linear expectation with one relative to a non-linear Neural Expectation Operator, $\varepsilon^\theta$, generated by a Backward Stochastic Differential Equation (BSDE) whose driver $f_\theta$ is parameterized by a neural network. Our main result is a representation theorem for a canonical NBM, which we define as a continuous $\varepsilon^\theta$-martingale with zero drift under the physical measure. We prove that, under a key structural assumption on the driver, such a canonical NBM exists and is the unique strong solution to a stochastic differential equation of the form ${\rm d} M_t = \nu_\theta(t, M_t) {\rm d} W_t$. Crucially, the volatility function $\nu_\theta$ is not postulated a priori but is implicitly defined by the algebraic constraint $g_\theta(t, M_t, \nu_\theta(t, M_t)) = 0$, where $g_\theta$ is a specialization of the BSDE driver. We develop the stochastic calculus for this process and prove a Girsanov-type theorem for the quadratic case, showing that an NBM acquires a drift under a new, learned measure. The character of this measure, whether pessimistic or optimistic, is endogenously determined by the learned parameters $\theta$, providing a rigorous foundation for models where the attitude towards uncertainty is a discoverable feature.

Abstract: Diffusion models, initially developed for image synthesis, demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities. Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. In this survey, we firstly introduce the standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. We then provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss current limitations in these approaches and potential future research directions. Overall, this survey details recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a reference for researchers in the field.

<title>SDSC:A Structure-Aware Metric for Semantic Signal Representation Learning</title>

arXiv:2507.14516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Signal Dice Similarity Coefficient (SDSC), a structure-aware metric function for time series self-supervised representation learning. Most Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) methods for signals commonly adopt distance-based objectives such as mean squared error (MSE), which are sensitive to amplitude, invariant to waveform polarity, and unbounded in scale. These properties hinder semantic alignment and reduce interpretability. SDSC addresses this by quantifying structural agreement between temporal signals based on the intersection of signed amplitudes, derived from the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).Although SDSC is defined as a structure-aware metric, it can be used as a loss by subtracting from 1 and applying a differentiable approximation of the Heaviside function for gradient-based optimization. A hybrid loss formulation is also proposed to combine SDSC with MSE, improving stability and preserving amplitude where necessary. Experiments on forecasting and classification benchmarks demonstrate that SDSC-based pre-training achieves comparable or improved performance over MSE, particularly in in-domain and low-resource scenarios. The results suggest that structural fidelity in signal representations enhances the semantic representation quality, supporting the consideration of structure-aware metrics as viable alternatives to conventional distance-based methods.

Abstract: Privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) based on cryptographic protocols has emerged as a promising paradigm to protect user data privacy in cloud-based machine learning services. While it achieves formal privacy protection, PPML often incurs significant efficiency and scalability costs due to orders of magnitude overhead compared to the plaintext counterpart. Therefore, there has been a considerable focus on mitigating the efficiency gap for PPML. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and systematic review of recent PPML studies with a focus on cross-level optimizations. Specifically, we categorize existing papers into protocol level, model level, and system level, and review progress at each level. We also provide qualitative and quantitative comparisons of existing works with technical insights, based on which we discuss future research directions and highlight the necessity of integrating optimizations across protocol, model, and system levels. We hope this survey can provide an overarching understanding of existing approaches and potentially inspire future breakthroughs in the PPML field. As the field is evolving fast, we also provide a public GitHub repository to continuously track the developments, which is available at https://github.com/PKU-SEC-Lab/Awesome-PPML-Papers.

We adopt the Florence model-a large-scale multimodal foundation model-as the backbone of our VQA pipeline, pairing a powerful vision encoder with a text encoder to interpret endoscopic images and produce clinically relevant answers. To improve generalization, we apply domain-specific augmentations that preserve medical features while increasing training diversity. Experiments on the KASVIR dataset show that fine-tuning Florence yields accurate responses on the official challenge metrics. Our results highlight the potential of large multimodal models in medical VQA and provide a strong baseline for future work on explainability, robustness, and clinical integration.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for various graph mining tasks, yet existing scalable solutions often struggle to balance execution efficiency with prediction accuracy. These difficulties stem from iterative message-passing techniques, which place significant computational demands and require extensive GPU memory, particularly when dealing with the neighbor explosion issue inherent in large-scale graphs. This paper introduces a scalable, low-cost, flexible, and efficient GNN framework called LPS-GNN, which can perform representation learning on 100 billion graphs with a single GPU in 10 hours and shows a 13.8% improvement in User Acquisition scenarios. We examine existing graph partitioning methods and design a superior graph partition algorithm named LPMetis. In particular, LPMetis outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches on various evaluation metrics. In addition, our paper proposes a subgraph augmentation strategy to enhance the model's predictive performance. It exhibits excellent compatibility, allowing the entire framework to accommodate various GNN algorithms. Successfully deployed on the Tencent platform, LPS-GNN has been tested on public and real-world datasets, achieving performance lifts of 8. 24% to 13. 89% over SOTA models in online applications.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM) techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality, and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis.

Abstract: Detecting collaborative problem solving (CPS) indicators from dialogue using machine learning techniques is a significant challenge for the field of AI in Education. Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to reliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the multimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and acoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial results demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of these enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on leveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop paper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not only improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset, but it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for classifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted that larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall performance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision of the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement among human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within these subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance across all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a structured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to support human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process.

Abstract: The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model and its variants for classifying collaborative problem solving (CPS) has been extensively explored within the AI in Education community. However, limited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised words in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions. Enhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to better inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and facilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary step towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription data contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The findings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily equate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular tokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis also identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the classification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such model transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their practice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their human expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to which the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is associated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation into the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning is still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring. Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high potential in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of blood image analysis. However, a detailed performance analysis of specific deep learning frameworks appears to be lacking. This paper compares the performance of three popular deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow with Keras, PyTorch, and JAX, in classifying blood cell images from the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset. The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the efficiency of these frameworks for medical image classification.

Abstract: Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in surveillance, logistics, agriculture, disaster management, and military operations. Accurate detection and classification of UAV flight states, such as hovering, cruising, ascending, or transitioning, which are essential for safe and effective operations. However, conventional time series classification (TSC) methods often lack robustness and generalization for dynamic UAV environments, while state of the art(SOTA) models like Transformers and LSTM based architectures typically require large datasets and entail high computational costs, especially with high-dimensional data streams. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates a Transformer-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with Multiple Instance Locally Explainable Learning (MILET) to address these challenges in UAV flight state classification. The Transformer encoder captures long-range temporal dependencies and complex telemetry dynamics, while the GAN module augments limited datasets with realistic synthetic samples. MIL is incorporated to focus attention on the most discriminative input segments, reducing noise and computational overhead. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy 96.5% on the DroneDetect dataset and 98.6% on the DroneRF dataset that outperforming other SOTA approaches. The framework also demonstrates strong computational efficiency and robust generalization across diverse UAV platforms and flight states, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in resource constrained environments.

<title>Exp-Graph: How Connections Learn Facial Attributes in Graph-based Expression Recognition</title>

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing, medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer. Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes, thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW. The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%, respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for practical facial expression recognition applications.

<title>Enhancing POI Recommendation through Global Graph Disentanglement with POI Weighted Module</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14612</link>

Abstract: Next point of interest (POI) recommendation primarily predicts future activities based on users' past check-in data and current status, providing significant value to users and service providers. We observed that the popular check-in times for different POI categories vary. For example, coffee shops are crowded in the afternoon because people like to have coffee to refresh after meals, while bars are busy late at night. However, existing methods rarely explore the relationship between POI categories and time, which may result in the model being unable to fully learn users' tendencies to visit certain POI categories at different times. Additionally, existing methods for modeling time information often convert it into time embeddings or calculate the time interval and incorporate it into the model, making it difficult to capture the continuity of time. Finally, during POI prediction, various weighting information is often ignored, such as the popularity of each POI, the transition relationships between POIs, and the distances between POIs, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel next POI recommendation framework called Graph Disentangler with POI Weighted Module (GDPW). This framework aims to jointly consider POI category information and multiple POI weighting factors. Specifically, the proposed GDPW learns category and time representations through the Global Category Graph and the Global Category-Time Graph. Then, we disentangle category and time information through contrastive learning. After prediction, the final POI recommendation for users is obtained by weighting the prediction results based on the transition weights and distance relationships between POIs. We conducted experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed GDPW outperforms other existing models, improving performance by 3% to 11%.

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) hold promise for improving healthcare access in low-resource settings, but their effectiveness in African primary care remains underexplored. We present a methodology for creating a benchmark dataset and evaluation framework focused on Kenyan Level 2 and 3 clinical care. Our approach uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ground clinical questions in Kenya's national guidelines, ensuring alignment with local standards. These guidelines were digitized, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval. Gemini Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with guideline excerpts to generate realistic clinical scenarios, multiple-choice questions, and rationale based answers in English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset includes thousands of regulator-aligned question answer pairs across common outpatient conditions. Beyond accuracy, we introduce evaluation metrics that test clinical reasoning, safety, and adaptability such as rare case detection (Needle in the Haystack), stepwise logic (Decision Points), and contextual adaptability. Initial results reveal significant performance gaps when LLMs are applied to localized scenarios, consistent with findings that LLM accuracy is lower on African medical content than on US-based benchmarks. This work offers a replicable model for guideline-driven, dynamic benchmarking to support safe AI deployment in African health systems.

<title>VTarbel: Targeted Label Attack with Minimal Knowledge on Detector-enhanced Vertical Federated Learning</title>

Abstract: Vertical federated learning (VFL) enables multiple parties with disjoint features to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. While privacy vulnerabilities of VFL are extensively-studied, its security threats-particularly targeted label attacks-remain underexplored. In such attacks, a passive party perturbs inputs at inference to force misclassification into adversary-chosen labels. Existing methods rely on unrealistic assumptions (e.g., accessing VFL-model's outputs) and ignore anomaly detectors deployed in real-world systems. To bridge this gap, we introduce VTarbel, a two-stage, minimal-knowledge attack framework explicitly designed to evade detector-enhanced VFL inference. During the preparation stage, the attacker selects a minimal set of high-expressiveness samples (via maximum mean discrepancy), submits them through VFL protocol to collect predicted labels, and uses these pseudo-labels to train estimated detector and surrogate model on local features. In attack stage, these models guide gradient-based perturbations of remaining samples, crafting adversarial instances that induce targeted misclassifications and evade detection. We implement VTarbel and evaluate it against four model architectures, seven multimodal datasets, and two anomaly detectors. Across all settings, VTarbel outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines, evades detection, and retains effective against three representative privacy-preserving defenses. These results reveal critical security blind spots in current VFL deployments and underscore urgent need for robust, attack-aware defenses.

<title>VMask: Tunable Label Privacy Protection for Vertical Federated Learning via Layer Masking</title>

Abstract: Though vertical federated learning (VFL) is generally considered to be privacy-preserving, recent studies have shown that VFL system is vulnerable to label inference attacks originating from various attack surfaces. Among these attacks, the model completion (MC) attack is currently the most powerful one. Existing defense methods against it either sacrifice model accuracy or incur impractical computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VMask, a novel label privacy protection framework designed to defend against MC attack from the perspective of layer masking. Our key insight is to disrupt the strong correlation between input data and intermediate outputs by applying the secret sharing (SS) technique to mask layer parameters in the attacker's model. We devise a strategy for selecting critical layers to mask, reducing the overhead that would arise from naively applying SS to the entire model. Moreover, VMask is the first framework to offer a tunable privacy budget to defenders, allowing for flexible control over the levels of label privacy according to actual requirements. We built a VFL system, implemented VMask on it, and extensively evaluated it using five model architectures and 13 datasets with different modalities, comparing it to 12 other defense methods. The results demonstrate that VMask achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, successfully thwarting the MC attack (reducing the label inference accuracy to a random guessing level) while preserving model performance (e.g., in Transformer-based model, the averaged drop of VFL model accuracy is only 0.09%). VMask's runtime is up to 60,846 times faster than cryptography-based methods, and it only marginally exceeds that of standard VFL by 1.8 times in a large Transformer-based model, which is generally acceptable.

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) across various NLP tasks, hallucinations in LLMs--where LLMs generate inaccurate responses--remains as a critical problem as it can be directly connected to a crisis of building safe and reliable LLMs. Uncertainty estimation is primarily used to measure hallucination levels in LLM responses so that correct and incorrect answers can be distinguished clearly. This study proposes an effective uncertainty estimation approach, \textbf{Cl}ust\textbf{e}ring-based sem\textbf{an}tic con\textbf{s}ist\textbf{e}ncy (\textbf{Cleanse}). Cleanse quantifies the uncertainty with the proportion of the intra-cluster consistency in the total consistency between LLM hidden embeddings which contain adequate semantic information of generations, by employing clustering. The effectiveness of Cleanse for detecting hallucination is validated using four off-the-shelf models, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B and two question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces FST.ai, a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation, motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability, and sport-agnostic potential of FST.ai to transform officiating standards across multiple disciplines.

Abstract: Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models (U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4 GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging, constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce institutional food waste.

Abstract: The exponential growth of spam text on the Internet necessitates robust detection mechanisms to mitigate risks such as information leakage and social instability. This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial strategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a novel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core innovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and phonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore produces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive learning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance between spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) generates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while improving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline approaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled examples.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models. Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset development.

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP) while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model reliability.

Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.

Abstract: Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions remains a significant challenge, due to the extreme class imbalance in real-world data and the often subtle patterns that separate fraud from legitimate activity. Existing research commonly attempts to address this by generating synthetic samples for the minority class using approaches such as GANs, VAEs, or hybrid generative models. However, these techniques, particularly when applied only to minority-class data, tend to result in overconfident classifiers and poor latent cluster separation, ultimately limiting real-world detection performance. In this study, we propose the Causal Prototype Attention Classifier (CPAC), an interpretable architecture that promotes class-aware clustering and improved latent space structure through prototype-based attention mechanisms and we will couple it with the encoder in a VAE-GAN allowing it to offer a better cluster separation moving beyond post-hoc sample augmentation. We compared CPAC-augmented models to traditional oversamplers, such as SMOTE, as well as to state-of-the-art generative models, both with and without CPAC-based latent classifiers. Our results show that classifier-guided latent shaping with CPAC delivers superior performance, achieving an F1-score of 93.14\% percent and recall of 90.18\%, along with improved latent cluster separation. Further ablation studies and visualizations provide deeper insight into the benefits and limitations of classifier-driven representation learning for fraud detection. The codebase for this work will be available at final submission.

Abstract: Automated theorem proving (ATP) has been a classical problem in artificial intelligence since its inception, yet it remains challenging due to its vast state and action space. Large language models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising heuristic for ATP, but they lack correctness guarantees and thus require interaction with a proof verifier. Such interactions typically follow one of two approaches: black-box interaction, which does not utilize intermediate proof states, or white-box approaches, which allow for incremental proof construction and examination of intermediate states. While black-box approaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods have comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language that factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and (ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling offers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation, reduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel search across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides feedback in case of errors. Our preliminary results hint that white-box approaches outperform black-box alternatives in some settings.

Abstract: Prompt-based continual learning (CL) offers a parameter-efficient way to adapt large language models (LLMs) across task sequences. However, most existing methods assume task-aware inference and maintain a growing list of task-specific prompts, which limits scalability and hides latent forgetting. In this work, we introduce GRID, a unified framework that addresses two key limitations: (1) latent forgetting under task-agnostic inference, and (2) prompt memory explosion as task sequences grow. GRID integrates a task-aware decoding mechanism that improves backward transfer by leveraging representative inputs, automatic task identification, and constrained decoding. Additionally, we propose a gradient-based prompt selection strategy that compresses less informative prompts into a single aggregated representation, enabling scalable and memory-efficient lifelong learning. Extensive experiments across short-sequence, long-sequence, and negative transfer benchmarks show that GRID significantly improves backward transfer, achieves competitive forward transfer, and reduces forgotten tasks by up to 80\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on T5 and Flan-T5 backbones.

<title>Skill Learning via Policy Diversity Yields Identifiable Representations for Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised feature learning and pretraining methods in reinforcement learning (RL) often rely on information-theoretic principles, termed mutual information skill learning (MISL). These methods aim to learn a representation of the environment while also incentivizing exploration thereof. However, the role of the representation and mutual information parametrization in MISL is not yet well understood theoretically. Our work investigates MISL through the lens of identifiable representation learning by focusing on the Contrastive Successor Features (CSF) method. We prove that CSF can provably recover the environment's ground-truth features up to a linear transformation due to the inner product parametrization of the features and skill diversity in a discriminative sense. This first identifiability guarantee for representation learning in RL also helps explain the implications of different mutual information objectives and the downsides of entropy regularizers. We empirically validate our claims in MuJoCo and DeepMind Control and show how CSF provably recovers the ground-truth features both from states and pixels.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer energy-efficient and biologically plausible alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks, but their performance depends critically on the tuning of neuron model parameters. In this work, we identify and characterize an operational space - a constrained region in the neuron hyperparameter domain (specifically membrane time constant tau and voltage threshold vth) - within which the network exhibits meaningful activity and functional behavior. Operating inside this manifold yields optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and spiking activity, while stepping outside leads to degeneration: either excessive energy use or complete network silence.
  Through systematic exploration across datasets and architectures, we visualize and quantify this manifold and identify efficient operating points. We further assess robustness to adversarial noise, showing that SNNs exhibit increased spike correlation and internal synchrony when operating outside their optimal region. These findings highlight the importance of principled hyperparameter tuning to ensure both task performance and energy efficiency. Our results offer practical guidelines for deploying robust and efficient SNNs, particularly in neuromorphic computing scenarios.

<title>GRACE: Generative Recommendation via Journey-Aware Sparse Attention on Chain-of-Thought Tokenization</title>

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However, their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE (Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation. To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed, intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and +106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home domain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces attention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.

<title>QUTCC: Quantile Uncertainty Training and Conformal Calibration for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Deep learning models often hallucinate, producing realistic artifacts that are not truly present in the sample. This can have dire consequences for scientific and medical inverse problems, such as MRI and microscopy denoising, where accuracy is more important than perceptual quality. Uncertainty quantification techniques, such as conformal prediction, can pinpoint outliers and provide guarantees for image regression tasks, improving reliability. However, existing methods utilize a linear constant scaling factor to calibrate uncertainty bounds, resulting in larger, less informative bounds. We propose QUTCC, a quantile uncertainty training and calibration technique that enables nonlinear, non-uniform scaling of quantile predictions to enable tighter uncertainty estimates. Using a U-Net architecture with a quantile embedding, QUTCC enables the prediction of the full conditional distribution of quantiles for the imaging task. During calibration, QUTCC generates uncertainty bounds by iteratively querying the network for upper and lower quantiles, progressively refining the bounds to obtain a tighter interval that captures the desired coverage. We evaluate our method on several denoising tasks as well as compressive MRI reconstruction. Our method successfully pinpoints hallucinations in image estimates and consistently achieves tighter uncertainty intervals than prior methods while maintaining the same statistical coverage.

<title>CXR-TFT: Multi-Modal Temporal Fusion Transformer for Predicting Chest X-ray Trajectories</title>

Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights that can directly improve clinical outcomes.

Abstract: Causality helps people reason about and understand complex systems, particularly through what-if analyses that explore how interventions might alter outcomes. Although existing methods embrace causal reasoning using interventions and counterfactual analysis, they primarily focus on effects at the population level. These approaches often fall short in systems characterized by significant heterogeneity, where the impact of an intervention can vary widely across subgroups. To address this challenge, we present XplainAct, a visual analytics framework that supports simulating, explaining, and reasoning interventions at the individual level within subpopulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of XplainAct through two case studies: investigating opioid-related deaths in epidemiology and analyzing voting inclinations in the presidential election.

Abstract: The advancement of general-purpose artificial intelligence relies on large language models (LLMs) that excel across a wide range of tasks, from structured reasoning to creative generation. However, post-training methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) often struggle with generalization, favoring memorization over transferable learning. In this work, we introduce Omni-Think, a unified reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enhances LLM performance across diverse tasks by combining rule-based verifiable rewards with generative preference signals via LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Our approach enables consistent optimization across task types and scales RL-based training to subjective domains. We further investigate training strategies, demonstrating that a curriculum-based progression that orders tasks from structured to open-ended improves performance and reduces forgetting. Experimental results across four domains reveal that curriculum learning improves performance by 5.2\% over joint training and 9.1\% over model merging. These results highlight the importance of task-aware sampling and hybrid supervision in scaling RL-based post-training for general-purpose LLMs.

<title>LeAdQA: LLM-Driven Context-Aware Temporal Grounding for Video Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The complexity and interconnectivity of entities involved in money laundering demand investigative reasoning over graph-structured data. This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines over localized subgraphs extracted from a financial knowledge graph. We propose a lightweight pipeline that retrieves k-hop neighborhoods around entities of interest, serializes them into structured text, and prompts an LLM via few-shot in-context learning to assess suspiciousness and generate justifications. Using synthetic anti-money laundering (AML) scenarios that reflect common laundering behaviors, we show that LLMs can emulate analyst-style logic, highlight red flags, and provide coherent explanations. While this study is exploratory, it illustrates the potential of LLM-based graph reasoning in AML and lays groundwork for explainable, language-driven financial crime analytics.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15 percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that LLM-based web navigation agents offer powerful automation capabilities but are vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. We show that adversaries can embed universal adversarial triggers in webpage HTML to hijack agent behavior that utilizes the accessibility tree to parse HTML, causing unintended or malicious actions. Using the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm and a Browser Gym agent powered by Llama-3.1, our system demonstrates high success rates across real websites in both targeted and general attacks, including login credential exfiltration and forced ad clicks. Our empirical results highlight critical security risks and the need for stronger defenses as LLM-driven autonomous web agents become more widely adopted.

Abstract: Pre-trained Transformer-based large models have revolutionized personal virtual assistants, but their deployment in cloud environments faces challenges related to data privacy and response latency. Deploying large models closer to the data and users has become a key research area to address these issues. However, applying these models directly often entails significant difficulties, such as model mismatching, resource constraints, and energy inefficiency. Automated design of customized models is necessary, but it faces three key challenges, namely, the high cost of centralized model customization, imbalanced performance from user heterogeneity, and suboptimal performance from data heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose ACME, an adaptive customization approach of Transformer-based large models via distributed systems. To avoid the low cost-efficiency of centralized methods, ACME employs a bidirectional single-loop distributed system to progressively achieve fine-grained collaborative model customization. In order to better match user heterogeneity, it begins by customizing the backbone generation and identifying the Pareto Front under model size constraints to ensure optimal resource utilization. Subsequently, it performs header generation and refines the model using data distribution-based personalized architecture aggregation to match data heterogeneity. Evaluation on different datasets shows that ACME achieves cost-efficient models under model size constraints. Compared to centralized systems, data transmission volume is reduced to 6 percent. Additionally, the average accuracy improves by 10 percent compared to the baseline, with the trade-off metrics increasing by nearly 30 percent.

Abstract: We study subliminal learning, a surprising phenomenon where language models transmit behavioral traits via semantically unrelated data. In our main experiments, a "teacher" model with some trait T (such as liking owls or being misaligned) generates a dataset consisting solely of number sequences. Remarkably, a "student" model trained on this dataset learns T. This occurs even when the data is filtered to remove references to T. We observe the same effect when training on code or reasoning traces generated by the same teacher model. However, we do not observe the effect when the teacher and student have different base models. To help explain our findings, we prove a theoretical result showing that subliminal learning occurs in all neural networks under certain conditions, and demonstrate subliminal learning in a simple MLP classifier. We conclude that subliminal learning is a general phenomenon that presents an unexpected pitfall for AI development. Distillation could propagate unintended traits, even when developers try to prevent this via data filtering.

Abstract: Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods. Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that \textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and 2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to enhance defense against deepfakes.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However, existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations, which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream deployment tools.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as a powerful approach for processing electronic health records (EHRs), offering flexibility to handle diverse medical data modalities. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the performance, fairness, and interpretability of foundation models, both as unimodal encoders and as multimodal learners, using the publicly available MIMIC-IV database. To support consistent and reproducible evaluation, we developed a standardized data processing pipeline that harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing additional bias. Through this benchmark, we aim to support the development of effective and trustworthy multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems for real-world clinical applications. Our code is available at https://github.com/nliulab/MIMIC-Multimodal.

Abstract: We revisit previous contrastive learning frameworks to investigate the effect of introducing an adaptive margin into the contrastive loss function for time series representation learning. Specifically, we explore whether an adaptive margin (eMargin), adjusted based on a predefined similarity threshold, can improve the separation between adjacent but dissimilar time steps and subsequently lead to better performance in downstream tasks. Our study evaluates the impact of this modification on clustering performance and classification in three benchmark datasets. Our findings, however, indicate that achieving high scores on unsupervised clustering metrics does not necessarily imply that the learned embeddings are meaningful or effective in downstream tasks. To be specific, eMargin added to InfoNCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in unsupervised clustering metrics, but struggles to achieve competitive results in downstream classification with linear probing. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/sfi-norwai/eMargin.

Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR. First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets, failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step, answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Abstract: We address the problem of safe policy learning in multi-agent safety-critical autonomous systems. In such systems, it is necessary for each agent to meet the safety requirements at all times while also cooperating with other agents to accomplish the task. Toward this end, we propose a safe Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HMARL) approach based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). Our proposed hierarchical approach decomposes the overall reinforcement learning problem into two levels learning joint cooperative behavior at the higher level and learning safe individual behavior at the lower or agent level conditioned on the high-level policy. Specifically, we propose a skill-based HMARL-CBF algorithm in which the higher level problem involves learning a joint policy over the skills for all the agents and the lower-level problem involves learning policies to execute the skills safely with CBFs. We validate our approach on challenging environment scenarios whereby a large number of agents have to safely navigate through conflicting road networks. Compared with existing state of the art methods, our approach significantly improves the safety achieving near perfect (within 5%) success/safety rate while also improving performance across all the environments.

<title>Grounding Degradations in Natural Language for All-In-One Video Restoration</title>

Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that grounds degradation-aware semantic context of video frames in natural language via foundation models, offering interpretable and flexible guidance. Unlike prior art, our method assumes no degradation knowledge in train or test time and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost. Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting, three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks.

Abstract: Pattern recognition with concise and flat AND-rules makes the Tsetlin Machine (TM) both interpretable and efficient, while the power of Tsetlin automata enables accuracy comparable to deep learning on an increasing number of datasets. We introduce the Graph Tsetlin Machine (GraphTM) for learning interpretable deep clauses from graph-structured input. Moving beyond flat, fixed-length input, the GraphTM gets more versatile, supporting sequences, grids, relations, and multimodality. Through message passing, the GraphTM builds nested deep clauses to recognize sub-graph patterns with exponentially fewer clauses, increasing both interpretability and data utilization. For image classification, GraphTM preserves interpretability and achieves 3.86%-points higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 than a convolutional TM. For tracking action coreference, faced with increasingly challenging tasks, GraphTM outperforms other reinforcement learning methods by up to 20.6%-points. In recommendation systems, it tolerates increasing noise to a greater extent than a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), e.g., for noise ratio 0.1, GraphTM obtains accuracy 89.86% compared to GCN's 70.87%. Finally, for viral genome sequence data, GraphTM is competitive with BiLSTM-CNN and GCN accuracy-wise, training 2.5x faster than GCN. The GraphTM's application to these varied fields demonstrates how graph representation learning and deep clauses bring new possibilities for TM learning.

<title>Application-Specific Component-Aware Structured Pruning of Deep Neural Networks via Soft Coefficient Optimization</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) offer significant versatility and performance benefits, but their widespread adoption is often hindered by high model complexity and computational demands. Model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as promising solutions to these challenges. However, it remains critical to ensure that application-specific performance characteristics are preserved during compression. In structured pruning, where groups of structurally coherent elements are removed, conventional importance metrics frequently fail to maintain these essential performance attributes. In this work, we propose an enhanced importance metric framework that not only reduces model size but also explicitly accounts for application-specific performance constraints. We employ multiple strategies to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each group, ensuring a balance between compression and task performance. Our approach is evaluated on an autoencoder tasked with reconstructing MNIST images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively preserves task-relevant performance, maintaining the model's usability even after substantial pruning, by satisfying the required application-specific criteria.

Abstract: Why do reinforcement learning (RL) policies fail or succeed? This is a challenging question due to the complex, high-dimensional nature of agent-environment interactions. In this work, we take a causal perspective on explaining the behavior of RL policies by viewing the states, actions, and rewards as variables in a low-level causal model. We introduce random perturbations to policy actions during execution and observe their effects on the cumulative reward, learning a simplified high-level causal model that explains these relationships. To this end, we develop a nonlinear Causal Model Reduction framework that ensures approximate interventional consistency, meaning the simplified high-level model responds to interventions in a similar way as the original complex system. We prove that for a class of nonlinear causal models, there exists a unique solution that achieves exact interventional consistency, ensuring learned explanations reflect meaningful causal patterns. Experiments on both synthetic causal models and practical RL tasks-including pendulum control and robot table tennis-demonstrate that our approach can uncover important behavioral patterns, biases, and failure modes in trained RL policies.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.

<title>Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention Decomposition (PSEAD): A Group-Theoretic Framework for Equivariant Transformers in Biological Systems</title>

Abstract: This research introduces the Theory of Partial Symmetry Enforced Attention Decomposition (PSEAD), a new and rigorous group-theoretic framework designed to seamlessly integrate local symmetry awareness into the core architecture of self-attention mechanisms within Transformer models. We formalize the concept of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms, showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.

Abstract: Floorplanning determines the shapes and locations of modules on a chip canvas and plays a critical role in optimizing the chip's Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) metrics. However, existing floorplanning approaches often fail to integrate with subsequent physical design stages, leading to suboptimal in-module component placement and excessive inter-module feedthrough. To tackle this challenge, we propose Flora, a three-stage feedthrough and placement aware rectilinear floorplanner. In the first stage, Flora employs wiremask and position mask techniques to achieve coarse-grained optimization of HPWL and feedthrough. In the second stage, under the constraint of a fixed outline, Flora achieves a zero-whitespace layout by locally resizing module shapes, thereby performing fine-grained optimization of feedthrough and improving component placement. In the third stage, Flora utilizes a fast tree search-based method to efficiently place components-including macros and standard cells-within each module, subsequently adjusting module boundaries based on the placement results to enable cross-stage optimization. Experimental results show that Flora outperforms recent state-of-the-art floorplanning approaches, achieving an average reduction of 6% in HPWL, 5.16% in FTpin, 29.15% in FTmod, and a 14% improvement in component placement performance.

<title>Byzantine-Robust Decentralized Coordination of LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Collaboration among multiple large language model (LLM) agents is a promising approach to overcome inherent limitations of single-agent systems, such as hallucinations and single points of failure. As LLM agents are increasingly deployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of tolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential.
  Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven coordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are inherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive leaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus, forcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high latency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader can be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are available, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives a quorum of votes.
  To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized consensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate answers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these answers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture enables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and consistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust aggregation techniques.
  Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates Byzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers.

<title>Probing EFX via PMMS: (Non-)Existence Results in Discrete Fair Division</title>

Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible items and provide new insights into the EFX problem, which is widely regarded as the central open question in fair division, and the PMMS problem, a strictly stronger variant of EFX. Our first result constructs a three-agent instance with two monotone valuations and one additive valuation in which no PMMS allocation exists. Since EFX allocations are known to exist under these assumptions, this establishes a formal separation between EFX and PMMS.
  We prove existence of fair allocations for three important special cases. We show that EFX allocations exist for personalized bivalued valuations, where for each agent $i$ there exist values $a_i > b_i$ such that agent $i$ assigns value $v_i(\{g\}) \in \{a_i, b_i\}$ to each good $g$. We establish an analogous existence result for PMMS allocations when $a_i$ is divisible by $b_i$. We also prove that PMMS allocations exist for binary-valued MMS-feasible valuations, where each bundle $S$ has value $v_i(S) \in \{0, 1\}$. Notably, this result holds even without assuming monotonicity of valuations and thus applies to the fair division of chores and mixed manna. Finally, we study a class of valuations called pair-demand valuations, which extend the well-studied unit-demand valuations to the case where each agent derives value from at most two items, and we show that PMMS allocations exist in this setting. Our proofs are constructive, and we provide polynomial-time algorithms for all three existence results.

Abstract: The detection of outliers within cryptocurrency limit order books (LOBs) is of paramount importance for comprehending market dynamics, particularly in highly volatile and nascent regulatory environments. This study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of robust statistical methods and advanced machine learning techniques for real-time anomaly identification in cryptocurrency LOBs. Within a unified testing environment, named AITA Order Book Signal (AITA-OBS), we evaluate the efficacy of thirteen diverse models to identify which approaches are most suitable for detecting potentially manipulative trading behaviours. An empirical evaluation, conducted via backtesting on a dataset of 26,204 records from a major exchange, demonstrates that the top-performing model, Empirical Covariance (EC), achieves a 6.70% gain, significantly outperforming a standard Buy-and-Hold benchmark. These findings underscore the effectiveness of outlier-driven strategies and provide insights into the trade-offs between model complexity, trade frequency, and performance. This study contributes to the growing corpus of research on cryptocurrency market microstructure by furnishing a rigorous benchmark of anomaly detection models and highlighting their potential for augmenting algorithmic trading and risk management.

Abstract: Autonomous error correction is critical for domestic robots to achieve reliable execution of complex long-horizon tasks. Prior work has explored self-reflection in Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning error correction; however, existing methods are constrained by inflexible self-reflection mechanisms that limit their effectiveness. Motivated by these limitations and inspired by human cognitive adaptation, we propose the Flexible Constructivism Reflection Framework (FCRF), a novel Mentor-Actor architecture that enables LLMs to perform flexible self-reflection based on task difficulty, while constructively integrating historical valuable experience with failure lessons. We evaluated FCRF on diverse domestic tasks through simulation in AlfWorld and physical deployment in the real-world environment. Experimental results demonstrate that FCRF significantly improves overall performance and self-reflection flexibility in complex long-horizon robotic tasks.

Abstract: The future of software engineering--SE 3.0--is unfolding with the rise of AI teammates: autonomous, goal-driven systems collaborating with human developers. Among these, autonomous coding agents are especially transformative, now actively initiating, reviewing, and evolving code at scale. This paper introduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents operate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading agents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across 61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented empirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development.
  Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software engineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in benchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI governance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review timelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond synthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often outperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a trust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code submission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in three years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics).
  We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for the SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev enables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports building the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/SAILResearch/AI_Teammates_in_SE3.

Abstract: Adoption of state-of-art Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) aims to revolutionize many industrial areas by reducing the amount of human intervention needed and effort for handling complex underlying processes. Automotive software development is considered to be a significant area for GenAI adoption, taking into account lengthy and expensive procedures, resulting from the amount of requirements and strict standardization. In this paper, we explore the adoption of GenAI for various steps of automotive software development, mainly focusing on requirements handling, compliance aspects and code generation. Three GenAI-related technologies are covered within the state-of-art: Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Vision Language Models (VLMs), as well as overview of adopted prompting techniques in case of code generation. Additionally, we also derive a generalized GenAI-aided automotive software development workflow based on our findings from this literature review. Finally, we include a summary of a survey outcome, which was conducted among our automotive industry partners regarding the type of GenAI tools used for their daily work activities.

<title>The hunt for new pulsating ultraluminous X-ray sources: a clustering approach</title>

Abstract: The discovery of fast and variable coherent signals in a handful of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) testifies to the presence of super-Eddington accreting neutron stars, and drastically changed the understanding of the ULX class. Our capability of discovering pulsations in ULXs is limited, among others, by poor statistics. However, catalogues and archives of high-energy missions contain information which can be used to identify new candidate pulsating ULXs (PULXs). The goal of this research is to single out candidate PULXs among those ULXs which have not shown pulsations due to an unfavourable combination of factors. We applied an AI approach to an updated database of ULXs detected by XMM-Newton. We first used an unsupervised clustering algorithm to sort out sources with similar characteristics into two clusters. Then, the sample of known PULX observations has been used to set the separation threshold between the two clusters and to identify the one containing the new candidate PULXs. We found that only a few criteria are needed to assign the membership of an observation to one of the two clusters. The cluster of new candidate PULXs counts 85 unique sources for 355 observations, with $\sim$85% of these new candidates having multiple observations. A preliminary timing analysis found no new pulsations for these candidates. This work presents a sample of new candidate PULXs observed by XMM-Newton, the properties of which are similar (in a multi-dimensional phase space) to those of the known PULXs, despite the absence of pulsations in their light curves. While this result is a clear example of the predictive power of AI-based methods, it also highlights the need for high-statistics observational data to reveal coherent signals from the sources in this sample and thus validate the robustness of the approach.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure, question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and WebWalkerQA benchmarks.

Abstract: Handheld grippers are increasingly used to collect human demonstrations due to their ease of deployment and versatility. However, most existing designs lack tactile sensing, despite the critical role of tactile feedback in precise manipulation. We present a portable, lightweight gripper with integrated tactile sensors that enables synchronized collection of visual and tactile data in diverse, real-world, and in-the-wild settings. Building on this hardware, we propose a cross-modal representation learning framework that integrates visual and tactile signals while preserving their distinct characteristics. The learning procedure allows the emergence of interpretable representations that consistently focus on contacting regions relevant for physical interactions. When used for downstream manipulation tasks, these representations enable more efficient and effective policy learning, supporting precise robotic manipulation based on multimodal feedback. We validate our approach on fine-grained tasks such as test tube insertion and pipette-based fluid transfer, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness under external disturbances.

<title>StableAnimator++: Overcoming Pose Misalignment and Face Distortion for Human Image Animation</title>

Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for enhanced facial fidelity.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning.

<title>NavVI: A Telerobotic Simulation with Multimodal Feedback for Visually Impaired Navigation in Warehouse Environments</title>

Abstract: Industrial warehouses are congested with moving forklifts, shelves and personnel, making robot teleoperation particularly risky and demanding for blind and low-vision (BLV) operators. Although accessible teleoperation plays a key role in inclusive workforce participation, systematic research on its use in industrial environments is limited, and few existing studies barely address multimodal guidance designed for BLV users. We present a novel multimodal guidance simulator that enables BLV users to control a mobile robot through a high-fidelity warehouse environment while simultaneously receiving synchronized visual, auditory, and haptic feedback. The system combines a navigation mesh with regular re-planning so routes remain accurate avoiding collisions as forklifts and human avatars move around the warehouse. Users with low vision are guided with a visible path line towards destination; navigational voice cues with clockwise directions announce upcoming turns, and finally proximity-based haptic feedback notifies the users of static and moving obstacles in the path. This real-time, closed-loop system offers a repeatable testbed and algorithmic reference for accessible teleoperation research. The simulator's design principles can be easily adapted to real robots due to the alignment of its navigation, speech, and haptic modules with commercial hardware, supporting rapid feasibility studies and deployment of inclusive telerobotic tools in actual warehouses.

Abstract: We introduce a novel extension to robust control theory that explicitly addresses uncertainty in the value function's gradient, a form of uncertainty endemic to applications like reinforcement learning where value functions are approximated. We formulate a zero-sum dynamic game where an adversary perturbs both system dynamics and the value function gradient, leading to a new, highly nonlinear partial differential equation: the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs Equation with Gradient Uncertainty (GU-HJBI). We establish its well-posedness by proving a comparison principle for its viscosity solutions under a uniform ellipticity condition. Our analysis of the linear-quadratic (LQ) case yields a key insight: we prove that the classical quadratic value function assumption fails for any non-zero gradient uncertainty, fundamentally altering the problem structure. A formal perturbation analysis characterizes the non-polynomial correction to the value function and the resulting nonlinearity of the optimal control law, which we validate with numerical studies. Finally, we bridge theory to practice by proposing a novel Gradient-Uncertainty-Robust Actor-Critic (GURAC) algorithm, accompanied by an empirical study demonstrating its effectiveness in stabilizing training. This work provides a new direction for robust control, holding significant implications for fields where function approximation is common, including reinforcement learning and computational finance.

Abstract: Currently, many studies view DNA sequences as a special type of language and utilize Transformers to model them. These studies use fixed-length k-mer segmentation and BPE subword tokenization but lack a systematic evaluation to determine which is superior. We compare k-mer segmentation with k=1,3,4,5,6, a 4,096-token BPE vocabulary, and three positional encoding methods-sinusoidal, AliBi, and RoPE. Each configuration is trained from scratch in 3, 6, 12, and 24-layer Transformer encoders and evaluated on GUE benchmark dataset. In general, BPE delivers higher and more stable performance across tasks by compressing frequent motifs into variable-length tokens, reducing sequence length, and improving model generalization. RoPE excels at capturing periodic motifs and extrapolating to long sequences, while AliBi also performs well on tasks driven by local dependencies. In terms of depth, we observe significant gains when increasing layers from 3 to 12, with only marginal improvements or slight overfitting at 24 layers. This study provides practical guidance for designing tokenization and positional encoding in DNA Transformer models.

<title>BleedOrigin: Dynamic Bleeding Source Localization in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection via Dual-Stage Detection and Tracking</title>

Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with 39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6 challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.

<title>Filling the Gap: Is Commonsense Knowledge Generation useful for Natural Language Inference?</title>

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic entailment of a premise for a given hypothesis. The task aims to develop systems that emulate natural human inferential processes where commonsense knowledge plays a major role. However, existing commonsense resources lack sufficient coverage for a variety of premise-hypothesis pairs. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models as commonsense knowledge generators for NLI along two key dimensions: their reliability in generating such knowledge and the impact of that knowledge on prediction accuracy. We adapt and modify existing metrics to assess LLM factuality and consistency in generating in this context. While explicitly incorporating commonsense knowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps distinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing contradictory and neutral inferences.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in AI/ML offer exciting opportunities to revolutionize analog design automation through data-driven approaches. In particular, researchers are increasingly fascinated by harnessing the power of generative AI to automate the discovery of novel analog circuit topologies. Unlocking the full potential of generative AI in these data-driven discoveries requires access to large and diverse datasets.Yet, there is a significant barrier in the analog domain--Analog circuit design is inherently proprietary, involving not only confidential circuit structures but also the underlying commercial semiconductor processes. As a result, current generative AI research is largely confined to individual researchers who construct small, narrowly focused private datasets. This fragmentation severely limits collaborative innovation and impedes progress across the research community. To address these challenges, we propose AnalogFed. AnalogFed enables collaborative topology discovery across decentralized clients (e.g., individual researchers or institutions) without requiring the sharing of raw private data. To make this vision practical, we introduce a suite of techniques tailored to the unique challenges of applying FedL in analog design--from generative model development and data heterogeneity handling to privacy-preserving strategies that ensure both flexibility and security for circuit designers and semiconductor manufacturers. Extensive experiments across varying client counts and dataset sizes demonstrate that AnalogFed achieves performance comparable to centralized baselines--while maintaining strict data privacy. Specifically, the generative AI model within AnalogFed achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and scalability in the design of analog circuit topologies.

<title>A Case Against Implicit Standards: Homophone Normalization in Machine Translation for Languages that use the Ge'ez Script</title>

Abstract: Homophone normalization, where characters that have the same sound in a writing script are mapped to one character, is a pre-processing step applied in Amharic Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. While this may improve performance reported by automatic metrics, it also results in models that are not able to understand different forms of writing in a single language. Further, there might be impacts in transfer learning, where models trained on normalized data do not generalize well to other languages. In this paper, we experiment with monolingual training and cross-lingual transfer to understand the impacts of normalization on languages that use the Ge'ez script. We then propose a post-inference intervention in which normalization is applied to model predictions instead of training data. With our simple scheme of post-inference normalization, we show that we can achieve an increase in BLEU score of up to 1.03 while preserving language features in training. Our work contributes to the broader discussion on technology-facilitated language change and calls for more language-aware interventions.

Abstract: The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support, and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.

Abstract: Anemia is a widespread global health issue, particularly among young children in low-resource settings. Traditional methods for anemia detection often require expensive equipment and expert knowledge, creating barriers to early and accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we explore the use of deep learning models for detecting anemia through conjunctival pallor, focusing on the CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59 months. The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age and other demographic data, enabling the development of machine learning models for accurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone, known for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and fine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques and a cross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accuracy of 0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an F1 score of 0.9773 demonstrating strong performance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge devices, we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of different bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model performance. Preliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high accuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370), and F1 Score (0.9377), more aggressive quantization (INT8 and INT4) leads to significant performance degradation. Overall, our study supports further exploration of quantization schemes and hardware optimizations to assess trade-offs between model size, inference time, and diagnostic accuracy in mobile healthcare applications.

Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini) across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes, and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts) to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information. We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

Abstract: We investigate multi-label classification involving large sets of labels, where the output labels may be known to satisfy some logical constraints. We look at an architecture in which classifiers for individual labels are fed into an expressive sequential model, which produces a joint distribution. One of the potential advantages for such an expressive model is its ability to modelling correlations, as can arise from constraints. We empirically demonstrate the ability of the architecture both to exploit constraints in training and to enforce constraints at inference time.

<title>Can LLMs Generate User Stories and Assess Their Quality?</title>

Abstract: Requirements elicitation is still one of the most challenging activities of the requirements engineering process due to the difficulty requirements analysts face in understanding and translating complex needs into concrete requirements. In addition, specifying high-quality requirements is crucial, as it can directly impact the quality of the software to be developed. Although automated tools allow for assessing the syntactic quality of requirements, evaluating semantic metrics (e.g., language clarity, internal consistency) remains a manual and time-consuming activity. This paper explores how LLMs can help automate requirements elicitation within agile frameworks, where requirements are defined as user stories (US). We used 10 state-of-the-art LLMs to investigate their ability to generate US automatically by emulating customer interviews. We evaluated the quality of US generated by LLMs, comparing it with the quality of US generated by humans (domain experts and students). We also explored whether and how LLMs can be used to automatically evaluate the semantic quality of US. Our results indicate that LLMs can generate US similar to humans in terms of coverage and stylistic quality, but exhibit lower diversity and creativity. Although LLM-generated US are generally comparable in quality to those created by humans, they tend to meet the acceptance quality criteria less frequently, regardless of the scale of the LLM model. Finally, LLMs can reliably assess the semantic quality of US when provided with clear evaluation criteria and have the potential to reduce human effort in large-scale assessments.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of pheochromocytoma (PCC) in abdominal CT scans is essential for tumor burden estimation, prognosis, and treatment planning. It may also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing. This study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify configurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed the nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D segmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class schemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived from adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen, kidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad body-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested on 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center. Performance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized Surface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the Tumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB) annotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84% improvement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split. The TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968) and strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold cross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1 to 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability. These findings highlight the value of incorporating relevant anatomical context in deep learning models to achieve precise PCC segmentation, supporting clinical assessment and longitudinal monitoring.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a practical and challenging task. This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances, respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite their potential, recent research has demonstrated that LLM agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, where malicious prompts are injected into the agent's input, causing it to perform an attacker-specified task rather than the intended task provided by the user. In this paper, we present PromptArmor, a simple yet effective defense against prompt injection attacks. Specifically, PromptArmor prompts an off-the-shelf LLM to detect and remove potential injected prompts from the input before the agent processes it. Our results show that PromptArmor can accurately identify and remove injected prompts. For example, using GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, or o4-mini, PromptArmor achieves both a false positive rate and a false negative rate below 1% on the AgentDojo benchmark. Moreover, after removing injected prompts with PromptArmor, the attack success rate drops to below 1%. We also demonstrate PromptArmor's effectiveness against adaptive attacks and explore different strategies for prompting an LLM. We recommend that PromptArmor be adopted as a standard baseline for evaluating new defenses against prompt injection attacks.

Abstract: SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions and their compiler intrinsics are widely supported by modern processors to accelerate performance-critical tasks. SIMD intrinsic programming, a trade-off between coding productivity and high performance, is widely used in the development of mainstream performance-critical libraries and daily computing tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated strong and comprehensive capabilities in code generation, show promise in assisting programmers with the challenges of SIMD intrinsic programming. However, existing code-generation benchmarks focus on only scalar code, and it is unclear how LLMs perform in generating vectorized code using SIMD intrinsics. To fill this gap, we propose SimdBench, the first code benchmark specifically designed for SIMD-intrinsic code generation, comprising 136 carefully crafted tasks and targeting five representative SIMD intrinsics: SSE (x86 Streaming SIMD Extension), AVX (x86 Advanced Vector Extension), Neon (ARM Advanced SIMD Extension), SVE (ARM Scalable Vector Extension), and RVV (RISC-V Vector Extension). We conduct a systematic evaluation (measuring both correctness and performance) of 18 representative LLMs on SimdBench, resulting in a series of novel and insightful findings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit a universal decrease in pass@k during SIMD-intrinsic code generation compared to scalar-code generation. Our in-depth analysis highlights promising directions for the further advancement of LLMs in the challenging domain of SIMD-intrinsic code generation. SimdBench is fully open source at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SimdBench-1B3F/ to benefit the broader research community.

Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts. Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published at https://github.com/Naeem-Paeedeh/CPLSR.

Abstract: Accurate demand forecasting is critical for enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of food delivery platforms, where spatial heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in order volumes directly influence operational decisions. This paper proposes an attention-based Graph Neural Network framework that captures spatial-temporal dependencies by modeling the food delivery environment as a graph. In this graph, nodes represent urban delivery zones, while edges reflect spatial proximity and inter-regional order flow patterns derived from historical data. The attention mechanism dynamically weighs the influence of neighboring zones, enabling the model to focus on the most contextually relevant areas during prediction. Temporal trends are jointly learned alongside spatial interactions, allowing the model to adapt to evolving demand patterns. Extensive experiments on real-world food delivery datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in forecasting future order volumes with high accuracy. The framework offers a scalable and adaptive solution to support proactive fleet positioning, resource allocation, and dispatch optimization in urban food delivery operations.

Abstract: The evolution towards future generation of mobile systems and fixed wireless networks is primarily driven by the urgency to support high-bandwidth and low-latency services across various vertical sectors. This endeavor is fueled by smartphones as well as technologies like industrial internet of things, extended reality (XR), and human-to-machine (H2M) collaborations for fostering industrial and social revolutions like Industry 4.0/5.0 and Society 5.0. To ensure an ideal immersive experience and avoid cyber-sickness for users in all the aforementioned usage scenarios, it is typically challenging to synchronize XR content from a remote machine to a human collaborator according to their head movements across a large geographic span in real-time over communication networks. Thus, we propose a novel H2M collaboration scheme where the human's head movements are predicted ahead with highly accurate models like bidirectional long short-term memory networks to orient the machine's camera in advance. We validate that XR frame size varies in accordance with the human's head movements and predict the corresponding bandwidth requirements from the machine's camera to propose a human-machine coordinated dynamic bandwidth allocation (HMC-DBA) scheme. Through extensive simulations, we show that end-to-end latency and jitter requirements of XR frames are satisfied with much lower bandwidth consumption over enterprise networks like Fiber-To-The-Room-Business. Furthermore, we show that better efficiency in network resource utilization is achieved by employing our proposed HMC-DBA over state-of-the-art schemes.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a foundational role in modern cardiovascular care, enabling non-invasive diagnosis of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and conduction disorders. While machine learning has achieved expert-level performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals, diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable reasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal analysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI established a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable, multimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive benchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.

<title>Optimal Transceiver Design in Over-the-Air Federated Distillation</title>

Abstract: The rapid proliferation and growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the development of federated learning (FL). FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to cooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to share the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made existing FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication overhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated distillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge distillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing the model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge, are shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property of the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in over-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the intractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex nature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle this problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate in over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs' transmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained given the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient approach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite relaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the original and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical results will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a significant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise in testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks.

Abstract: Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

Abstract: We present a speaker conditioned text-to-speech (TTS) system aimed at addressing challenges in generating speech for unseen speakers and supporting diverse Indian languages. Our method leverages a diffusion-based TTS architecture, where a speaker encoder extracts embeddings from short reference audio samples to condition the DDPM decoder for multispeaker generation. To further enhance prosody and naturalness, we employ a cross-attention based duration prediction mechanism that utilizes reference audio, enabling more accurate and speaker consistent timing. This results in speech that closely resembles the target speaker while improving duration modeling and overall expressiveness. Additionally, to improve zero-shot generation, we employed classifier free guidance, allowing the system to generate speech more near speech for unknown speakers. Using this approach, we trained language-specific speaker-conditioned models. Using the IndicSUPERB dataset for multiple Indian languages such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Punjabi and Tamil.

<title>A Novel Self-Evolution Framework for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited to some extent by pre-training, so some researchers optimize LLMs through post-training. Existing post-training strategies, such as memory-based retrieval or preference optimization, improve user alignment yet fail to enhance the model's domain cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Dual-Phase Self-Evolution (DPSE) framework that jointly optimizes user preference adaptation and domain-specific competence. DPSE introduces a Censor module to extract multi-dimensional interaction signals and estimate satisfaction scores, which guide structured data expansion via topic-aware and preference-driven strategies. These expanded datasets support a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline: supervised domain grounding followed by frequency-aware preference optimization. Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning, Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines. Ablation studies validate the contribution of each module. In this way, our framework provides an autonomous path toward continual self-evolution of LLMs.

Abstract: Recent trends in Reinforcement Learning (RL) highlight the need for agents to learn from reward-free interactions and alternative supervision signals, such as unlabeled or incomplete demonstrations, rather than relying solely on explicit reward maximization. Additionally, developing generalist agents that can adapt efficiently in real-world environments often requires leveraging these reward-free signals to guide learning and behavior. However, while intrinsic motivation techniques provide a means for agents to seek out novel or uncertain states in the absence of explicit rewards, they are often challenged by dense reward environments or the complexity of high-dimensional state and action spaces. Furthermore, most existing approaches rely directly on the unprocessed intrinsic reward signals, which can make it difficult to shape or control the agent's exploration effectively. We propose a framework that can effectively utilize expert demonstrations, even when they are incomplete and imperfect. By applying a mapping function to transform the similarity between an agent's state and expert data into a shaped intrinsic reward, our method allows for flexible and targeted exploration of expert-like behaviors. We employ a Mixture of Autoencoder Experts to capture a diverse range of behaviors and accommodate missing information in demonstrations. Experiments show our approach enables robust exploration and strong performance in both sparse and dense reward environments, even when demonstrations are sparse or incomplete. This provides a practical framework for RL in realistic settings where optimal data is unavailable and precise reward control is needed.

Abstract: System identification methods for multivariate time-series, such as neural and behavioral recordings, have been used to build models for predicting one from the other. For example, Preferential Subspace Identification (PSID) builds a state-space model of a primary time-series (e.g., neural activity) to optimally predict a secondary time-series (e.g., behavior). However, PSID focuses on optimal prediction using past primary data, even though in offline applications, better estimation can be achieved by incorporating concurrent data (filtering) or all available data (smoothing). Here, we extend PSID to enable optimal filtering and smoothing. First, we show that the presence of a secondary signal makes it possible to uniquely identify a model with an optimal Kalman update step (to enable filtering) from a family of otherwise equivalent state-space models. Our filtering solution augments PSID with a reduced-rank regression step that directly learns the optimal gain required for the update step from data. We refer to this extension of PSID as PSID with filtering. Second, inspired by two-filter Kalman smoother formulations, we develop a novel forward-backward PSID smoothing algorithm where we first apply PSID with filtering and then apply it again in the reverse time direction on the residuals of the filtered secondary signal. We validate our methods on simulated data, showing that our approach recovers the ground-truth model parameters for filtering, and achieves optimal filtering and smoothing decoding performance of the secondary signal that matches the ideal performance of the true underlying model. This work provides a principled framework for optimal linear filtering and smoothing in the two-signal setting, significantly expanding the toolkit for analyzing dynamic interactions in multivariate time-series.

Abstract: Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations. Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness across challenging surgical conditions. The code, dataset, and video results are available at https://szupc.github.io/EndoControlMag/.

Abstract: The emergence of the tool agent paradigm has broadened the capability boundaries of the Large Language Model (LLM), enabling it to complete more complex tasks. However, the effectiveness of this paradigm is limited due to the issue of parameter failure during its execution. To explore this phenomenon and propose corresponding suggestions, we first construct a parameter failure taxonomy in this paper. We derive five failure categories from the invocation chain of a mainstream tool agent. Then, we explore the correlation between three different input sources and failure categories by applying 15 input perturbation methods to the input. Experimental results show that parameter name hallucination failure primarily stems from inherent LLM limitations, while issues with input sources mainly cause other failure patterns. To improve the reliability and effectiveness of tool-agent interactions, we propose corresponding improvement suggestions, including standardizing tool return formats, improving error feedback mechanisms, and ensuring parameter consistency.

Abstract: Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns, addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns. Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2% I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.

<title>Beyond Model Base Selection: Weaving Knowledge to Master Fine-grained Neural Network Design</title>

Abstract: Database systems have recently advocated for embedding machine learning (ML) capabilities, offering declarative model queries over large, managed model repositories, thereby circumventing the huge computational overhead of traditional ML-based algorithms in automated neural network model selection. Pioneering database studies aim to organize existing benchmark repositories as model bases (MB), querying them for the model records with the highest performance estimation metrics for given tasks. However, this static model selection practice overlooks the fine-grained, evolving relational dependencies between diverse task queries and model architecture variations, resulting in suboptimal matches and failing to further refine the model effectively. To fill the model refinement gap in database research, we propose M-DESIGN, a curated model knowledge base (MKB) pipeline for mastering neural network refinement by adaptively weaving prior insights about model architecture modification. First, we propose a knowledge weaving engine that reframes model refinement as an adaptive query problem over task metadata. Given a user's task query, M-DESIGN quickly matches and iteratively refines candidate models by leveraging a graph-relational knowledge schema that explicitly encodes data properties, architecture variations, and pairwise performance deltas as joinable relations. This schema supports fine-grained relational analytics over architecture tweaks and drives a predictive query planner that can detect and adapt to out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. We instantiate M-DESIGN for graph analytics tasks, where our model knowledge base enriches existing benchmarks with structured metadata covering 3 graph tasks and 22 graph datasets, contributing data records of 67,760 graph models. Empirical results demonstrate that M-DESIGN delivers the optimal model in 26 of 33 data-task pairs within limited budgets.

Abstract: High-resolution volumetric computed tomography (CT) is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning in thoracic diseases; however, it is limited by radiation dose and hardware costs. We present the Transformer Volumetric Super-Resolution Network (\textbf{TVSRN-V2}), a transformer-based super-resolution (SR) framework designed for practical deployment in clinical lung CT analysis. Built from scalable components, including Through-Plane Attention Blocks (TAB) and Swin Transformer V2 -- our model effectively reconstructs fine anatomical details in low-dose CT volumes and integrates seamlessly with downstream analysis pipelines. We evaluate its effectiveness on three critical lung cancer tasks -- lobe segmentation, radiomics, and prognosis -- across multiple clinical cohorts. To enhance robustness across variable acquisition protocols, we introduce pseudo-low-resolution augmentation, simulating scanner diversity without requiring private data. TVSRN-V2 demonstrates a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (+4\% Dice), higher radiomic feature reproducibility, and enhanced predictive performance (+0.06 C-index and AUC). These results indicate that SR-driven recovery of structural detail significantly enhances clinical decision support, positioning TVSRN-V2 as a well-engineered, clinically viable system for dose-efficient imaging and quantitative analysis in real-world CT workflows.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has emerged as a landmark advancement within the broad field of artificial intelligence, effectively catalyzing the advent of large language models (LLMs). However, despite its remarkable capabilities and the substantial progress it has facilitated, the Transformer architecture still has some limitations. One such intrinsic limitation is its inability to effectively capture the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular expressions or deterministic context-free grammars. Drawing inspiration from pushdown automata, which efficiently resolve deterministic context-free grammars using stacks, we propose StackTrans to address the aforementioned issue within LLMs. Unlike previous approaches that modify the attention computation, StackTrans explicitly incorporates hidden state stacks between Transformer layers. This design maintains compatibility with existing frameworks like flash-attention. Specifically, our design features stack operations -- such as pushing and popping hidden states -- that are differentiable and can be learned in an end-to-end manner. Our comprehensive evaluation spans benchmarks for both Chomsky hierarchies and large-scale natural languages. Across these diverse tasks, StackTrans consistently outperforms standard Transformer models and other baselines. We have successfully scaled StackTrans up from 360M to 7B parameters. In particular, our from-scratch pretrained model StackTrans-360M outperforms several larger open-source LLMs with 2-3x more parameters, showcasing its superior efficiency and reasoning capability.

Abstract: Fine-tuning the large language models (LLMs) are prevented by the deficiency of centralized control and the massive computing and communication overhead on the decentralized schemes. While the typical standard federated learning (FL) supports data privacy, the central server requirement creates a single point of attack and vulnerability to poisoning attacks. Generalizing the result in this direction to 70B-parameter models in the heterogeneous, trustless environments has turned out to be a huge, yet unbroken bottleneck. This paper introduces FLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM fine-tuning. Integrating a blockchain-based trust layer with economic incentives, FLock replaces the central aggregator with a secure, auditable protocol for cooperation among untrusted parties. We present the first empirical validation of fine-tuning a 70B LLM in a secure, multi-domain, decentralized setting. Our experiments show the FLock framework defends against backdoor poisoning attacks that compromise standard FL optimizers and fosters synergistic knowledge transfer. The resulting models show a >68% reduction in adversarial attack success rates. The global model also demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization, outperforming models trained in isolation on their own specialized data.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in metaphor interpretation across multiple datasets, tasks, and prompt configurations. Although metaphor processing has gained significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings, often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning, and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language, highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor interpretation tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation suffers from data scarcity, particularly in polyp detection where annotation requires specialized expertise. We present SynDiff, a framework combining text-guided synthetic data generation with efficient diffusion-based segmentation. Our approach employs latent diffusion models to generate clinically realistic synthetic polyps through text-conditioned inpainting, augmenting limited training data with semantically diverse samples. Unlike traditional diffusion methods requiring iterative denoising, we introduce direct latent estimation enabling single-step inference with T x computational speedup. On CVC-ClinicDB, SynDiff achieves 96.0% Dice and 92.9% IoU while maintaining real-time capability suitable for clinical deployment. The framework demonstrates that controlled synthetic augmentation improves segmentation robustness without distribution shift. SynDiff bridges the gap between data-hungry deep learning models and clinical constraints, offering an efficient solution for deployment in resourcelimited medical settings.

Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic, noncommunicable brain disorder, and sudden seizure onsets can significantly impact patients' quality of life and health. However, wearable seizure-predicting devices are still limited, partly due to the bulky size of EEG-collecting devices. To relieve the problem, we proposed a novel two-stage channel-aware Set Transformer Network that could perform seizure prediction with fewer EEG channel sensors. We also tested a seizure-independent division method which could prevent the adjacency of training and test data. Experiments were performed on the CHB-MIT dataset which includes 22 patients with 88 merged seizures. The mean sensitivity before channel selection was 76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection, dominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of channels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1% with an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the seizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous seizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG recordings.

<title>Multi-beam Beamforming in RIS-aided MIMO Subject to Reradiation Mask Constraints -- Optimization and Machine Learning Design</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are an emerging technology for improving spectral efficiency and reducing power consumption in future wireless systems. This paper investigates the joint design of the transmit precoding matrices and the RIS phase shift vector in a multi-user RIS-aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system. We formulate a max-min optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate while considering transmit power and reradiation mask constraints. The achievable rate is simplified using the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm, and the problem is broken into quadratic programs with quadratic constraints (QPQC) sub-problems using an alternating optimization approach. To improve efficiency, we develop a model-based neural network optimization that utilizes the one-hot encoding for the angles of incidence and reflection. We address practical RIS limitations by using a greedy search algorithm to solve the optimization problem for discrete phase shifts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods effectively shape the multi-beam radiation pattern towards desired directions while satisfying reradiation mask constraints. The neural network design reduces the execution time, and the discrete phase shift scheme performs well with a small reduction of the beamforming gain by using only four phase shift levels.

<title>To Label or Not to Label: PALM -- A Predictive Model for Evaluating Sample Efficiency in Active Learning Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15381</link>

Abstract: Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy, coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of AL in both research and real-world applications.

<title>PiMRef: Detecting and Explaining Ever-evolving Spear Phishing Emails with Knowledge Base Invariants</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15393</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phishing emails are a critical component of the cybercrime kill chain due to their wide reach and low cost. Their ever-evolving nature renders traditional rule-based and feature-engineered detectors ineffective in the ongoing arms race between attackers and defenders. The rise of large language models (LLMs) further exacerbates the threat, enabling attackers to craft highly convincing phishing emails at minimal cost.
  This work demonstrates that LLMs can generate psychologically persuasive phishing emails tailored to victim profiles, successfully bypassing nearly all commercial and academic detectors. To defend against such threats, we propose PiMRef, the first reference-based phishing email detector that leverages knowledge-based invariants. Our core insight is that persuasive phishing emails often contain disprovable identity claims, which contradict real-world facts. PiMRef reframes phishing detection as an identity fact-checking task. Given an email, PiMRef (i) extracts the sender's claimed identity, (ii) verifies the legitimacy of the sender's domain against a predefined knowledge base, and (iii) detects call-to-action prompts that push user engagement. Contradictory claims are flagged as phishing indicators and serve as human-understandable explanations.
  Compared to existing methods such as D-Fence, HelpHed, and ChatSpamDetector, PiMRef boosts precision by 8.8% with no loss in recall on standard benchmarks like Nazario and PhishPot. In a real-world evaluation of 10,183 emails across five university accounts over three years, PiMRef achieved 92.1% precision, 87.9% recall, and a median runtime of 0.05s, outperforming the state-of-the-art in both effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Hearing loss simulation models are essential for hearing aid deployment. However, existing models have high computational complexity and latency, which limits real-time applications and lack direct integration with speech processing systems. To address these issues, we propose Neuro-MSBG, a lightweight end-to-end model with a personalized audiogram encoder for effective time-frequency modeling. Experiments show that Neuro-MSBG supports parallel inference and retains the intelligibility and perceptual quality of the original MSBG, with a Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) of 0.9247 for Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) and 0.8671 for Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ). Neuro-MSBG reduces simulation runtime by a factor of 46 (from 0.970 seconds to 0.021 seconds for a 1 second input), further demonstrating its efficiency and practicality.

<title>EgoPrune: Efficient Token Pruning for Egomotion Video Reasoning in Embodied Agent</title>

Abstract: Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning. EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering (PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover, we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for on-device egomotion video reasoning.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding. Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs, enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks, but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene editing.

<title>Solving nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs equations with PINN-based policy iteration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mesh-free policy iteration framework that combines classical dynamic programming with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve high-dimensional, nonconvex Hamilton--Jacobi--Isaacs (HJI) equations arising in stochastic differential games and robust control. The method alternates between solving linear second-order PDEs under fixed feedback policies and updating the controls via pointwise minimax optimization using automatic differentiation. Under standard Lipschitz and uniform ellipticity assumptions, we prove that the value function iterates converge locally uniformly to the unique viscosity solution of the HJI equation. The analysis establishes equi-Lipschitz regularity of the iterates, enabling provable stability and convergence without requiring convexity of the Hamiltonian. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of the method. In a two-dimensional stochastic path-planning game with a moving obstacle, our method matches finite-difference benchmarks with relative $L^2$-errors below %10^{-2}%. In five- and ten-dimensional publisher-subscriber differential games with anisotropic noise, the proposed approach consistently outperforms direct PINN solvers, yielding smoother value functions and lower residuals. Our results suggest that integrating PINNs with policy iteration is a practical and theoretically grounded method for solving high-dimensional, nonconvex HJI equations, with potential applications in robotics, finance, and multi-agent reinforcement learning.

<title>The New LLM Bottleneck: A Systems Perspective on Latent Attention and Mixture-of-Experts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational workloads composing traditional Transformer models are starkly bifurcated. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is memory-bound, with low arithmetic intensity, while feedforward layers are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the MHA bottleneck.
  This paper argues that recent architectural shifts, namely Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), challenge the premise of specialized attention hardware. We make two key observations. First, the arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude greater than that of MHA, shifting it close to a compute-bound regime well-suited for modern accelerators like GPUs. Second, by distributing MoE experts across a pool of accelerators, their arithmetic intensity can be tuned through batching to match that of the dense layers, creating a more balanced computational profile.
  These findings reveal a diminishing need for specialized attention hardware. The central challenge for next-generation Transformers is no longer accelerating a single memory-bound layer. Instead, the focus must shift to designing balanced systems with sufficient compute, memory capacity, memory bandwidth, and high-bandwidth interconnects to manage the diverse demands of large-scale models.

Abstract: The increasing demand for autonomous systems in complex and dynamic environments has driven significant research into intelligent path planning methodologies. For decades, graph-based search algorithms, linear programming techniques, and evolutionary computation methods have served as foundational approaches in this domain. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful method for enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal navigation strategies through interaction with their environments. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of traditional approaches as well as the recent advancements in DRL applied to path planning tasks, focusing on autonomous vehicles, drones, and robotic platforms. Key algorithms across both conventional and learning-based paradigms are categorized, with their innovations and practical implementations highlighted. This is followed by a thorough discussion of their respective strengths and limitations in terms of computational efficiency, scalability, adaptability, and robustness. The survey concludes by identifying key open challenges and outlining promising avenues for future research. Special attention is given to hybrid approaches that integrate DRL with classical planning techniques to leverage the benefits of both learning-based adaptability and deterministic reliability, offering promising directions for robust and resilient autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable and rule-compliant behavior of autonomous agents in uncertain environments remains a fundamental challenge in modern robotics. Our work shows how neuro-symbolic systems, which integrate probabilistic, symbolic white-box reasoning models with deep learning methods, offer a powerful solution to this challenge. This enables the simultaneous consideration of explicit rules and neural models trained on noisy data, combining the strength of structured reasoning with flexible representations. To this end, we introduce the Constitutional Controller (CoCo), a novel framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of agents by reasoning over deep probabilistic logic programs representing constraints such as those found in shared traffic spaces. Furthermore, we propose the concept of self-doubt, implemented as a probability density conditioned on doubt features such as travel velocity, employed sensors, or health factors. In a real-world aerial mobility study, we demonstrate CoCo's advantages for intelligent autonomous systems to learn appropriate doubts and navigate complex and uncertain environments safely and compliantly.

Abstract: We report our recent progress towards building generalist robot policies, the development of GR-3. GR-3 is a large-scale vision-language-action (VLA) model. It showcases exceptional capabilities in generalizing to novel objects, environments, and instructions involving abstract concepts. Furthermore, it can be efficiently fine-tuned with minimal human trajectory data, enabling rapid and cost-effective adaptation to new settings. GR-3 also excels in handling long-horizon and dexterous tasks, including those requiring bi-manual manipulation and mobile movement, showcasing robust and reliable performance. These capabilities are achieved through a multi-faceted training recipe that includes co-training with web-scale vision-language data, efficient fine-tuning from human trajectory data collected via VR devices, and effective imitation learning with robot trajectory data. In addition, we introduce ByteMini, a versatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with exceptional flexibility and reliability, capable of accomplishing a wide range of tasks when integrated with GR-3. Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the state-of-the-art baseline method, $\pi_0$, on a wide variety of challenging tasks. We hope GR-3 can serve as a step towards building generalist robots capable of assisting humans in daily life.

Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to power digital assistants capable of complex action execution. These assistants rely on pre-trained programming knowledge to execute multi-step goals by composing objects and functions defined in assistant libraries into action execution programs. To achieve this, we develop ASPERA, a framework comprising an assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine. Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

<title>Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models, such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which empirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in experiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs significantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/JohannesAck/OffPolicyCorrectedRewardModeling

Abstract: Accurate segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but existing models often assume fixed, high-resolution inputs and degrade significantly when faced with lower-resolution data in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose RARE-UNet, a resolution-aware multi-scale segmentation architecture that dynamically adapts its inference path to the spatial resolution of the input. Central to our design are multi-scale blocks integrated at multiple encoder depths, a resolution-aware routing mechanism, and consistency-driven training that aligns multi-resolution features with full-resolution representations. We evaluate RARE-UNet on two benchmark brain imaging tasks for hippocampus and tumor segmentation. Compared to standard UNet, its multi-resolution augmented variant, and nnUNet, our model achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.84 and 0.65 across resolution, while maintaining consistent performance and significantly reduced inference time at lower resolutions. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our architecture in achieving resolution-robust segmentation. The codes are available at: https://github.com/simonsejse/RARE-UNet.

Abstract: Evaluating the scientific discovery capabilities of large language model based agents, particularly how they cope with varying environmental complexity and utilize prior knowledge, requires specialized benchmarks currently lacking in the landscape. To address this gap, we introduce PhysGym, a novel benchmark suite and simulation platform for rigorously assessing LLM-based scientific reasoning in interactive physics environments. PhysGym's primary contribution lies in its sophisticated control over the level of prior knowledge provided to the agent. This allows researchers to dissect agent performance along axes including the complexity of the problem and the prior knowledge levels. The benchmark comprises a suite of interactive simulations, where agents must actively probe environments, gather data sequentially under constraints and formulate hypotheses about underlying physical laws. PhysGym provides standardized evaluation protocols and metrics for assessing hypothesis accuracy and model fidelity. We demonstrate the benchmark's utility by presenting results from baseline LLMs, showcasing its ability to differentiate capabilities based on varying priors and task complexity.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of satellite constellations in near-Earth orbits presents significant challenges in satellite network management, requiring innovative approaches for efficient, scalable, and resilient operations. This paper explores the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in optimizing the operation of satellite mega-constellations, drawing from the ConstellAI project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA). A consortium comprising GMV GmbH, Saarland University, and Thales Alenia Space collaborates to develop AI-driven algorithms and demonstrates their effectiveness over traditional methods for two crucial operational challenges: data routing and resource allocation. In the routing use case, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is used to improve the end-to-end latency by learning from historical queuing latency, outperforming classical shortest path algorithms. For resource allocation, RL optimizes the scheduling of tasks across constellations, focussing on efficiently using limited resources such as battery and memory. Both use cases were tested for multiple satellite constellation configurations and operational scenarios, resembling the real-life spacecraft operations of communications and Earth observation satellites. This research demonstrates that RL not only competes with classical approaches but also offers enhanced flexibility, scalability, and generalizability in decision-making processes, which is crucial for the autonomous and intelligent management of satellite fleets. The findings of this activity suggest that AI can fundamentally alter the landscape of satellite constellation management by providing more adaptive, robust, and cost-effective solutions.

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification, yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation, we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101, EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1 over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup, delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further research.

In contrast, default groups are allowed the full complexity of human existence. We describe the constrained representations of queer people in LLM generations in terms of harmful representations, narrow representations, and discursive othering and formulate hypotheses to test for these phenomena. Our results show that LLMs are significantly limited in their portrayals of queer personas.

Abstract: Current research on decision-making in safety-critical scenarios often relies on inefficient data-driven scenario generation or specific modeling approaches, which fail to capture corner cases in real-world contexts. To address this issue, we propose a Red-Team Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework, where background vehicles with interference capabilities are treated as red-team agents. Through active interference and exploration, red-team vehicles can uncover corner cases outside the data distribution. The framework uses a Constraint Graph Representation Markov Decision Process, ensuring that red-team vehicles comply with safety rules while continuously disrupting the autonomous vehicles (AVs). A policy threat zone model is constructed to quantify the threat posed by red-team vehicles to AVs, inducing more extreme actions to increase the danger level of the scenario. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly impacts AVs decision-making safety and generates various corner cases. This method also offers a novel direction for research in safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as Microsoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is prompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts to gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise LLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses mild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM integrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for these multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory, optimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks are shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context (e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety measures are in place.
  We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including statistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization techniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is supported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we derive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training and demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with high AUC. We also introduce an approach called "spotlighting" that uses input transformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by an order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and empirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work highlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond single-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both attacks and defenses.

<title>Accelerating HEC-RAS: A Recurrent Neural Operator for Rapid River Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Physics-based solvers like HEC-RAS provide high-fidelity river forecasts but are too computationally intensive for on-the-fly decision-making during flood events. The central challenge is to accelerate these simulations without sacrificing accuracy. This paper introduces a deep learning surrogate that treats HEC-RAS not as a solver but as a data-generation engine. We propose a hybrid, auto-regressive architecture that combines a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to capture short-term temporal dynamics with a Geometry-Aware Fourier Neural Operator (Geo-FNO) to model long-range spatial dependencies along a river reach. The model learns underlying physics implicitly from a minimal eight-channel feature vector encoding dynamic state, static geometry, and boundary forcings extracted directly from native HEC-RAS files. Trained on 67 reaches of the Mississippi River Basin, the surrogate was evaluated on a year-long, unseen hold-out simulation. Results show the model achieves a strong predictive accuracy, with a median absolute stage error of 0.31 feet. Critically, for a full 67-reach ensemble forecast, our surrogate reduces the required wall-clock time from 139 minutes to 40 minutes, a speedup of nearly 3.5 times over the traditional solver. The success of this data-driven approach demonstrates that robust feature engineering can produce a viable, high-speed replacement for conventional hydraulic models, improving the computational feasibility of large-scale ensemble flood forecasting.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) - particularly generative AI - present new opportunities to accelerate, or even automate, epidemiological research. Unlike disciplines based on physical experimentation, a sizable fraction of Epidemiology relies on secondary data analysis and thus is well-suited for such augmentation. Yet, it remains unclear which specific tasks can benefit from AI interventions or where roadblocks exist. Awareness of current AI capabilities is also mixed. Here, we map the landscape of epidemiological tasks using existing datasets - from literature review to data access, analysis, writing up, and dissemination - and identify where existing AI tools offer efficiency gains. While AI can increase productivity in some areas such as coding and administrative tasks, its utility is constrained by limitations of existing AI models (e.g. hallucinations in literature reviews) and human systems (e.g. barriers to accessing datasets). Through examples of AI-generated epidemiological outputs, including fully AI-generated papers, we demonstrate that recently developed agentic systems can now design and execute epidemiological analysis, albeit to varied quality (see https://github.com/edlowther/automated-epidemiology). Epidemiologists have new opportunities to empirically test and benchmark AI systems; realising the potential of AI will require two-way engagement between epidemiologists and engineers.

Abstract: Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2% accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000 parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.

<title>Data Mixing Agent: Learning to Re-weight Domains for Continual Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment. Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining. Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior model performance with less source-field data.

Our multimodal model showed performance comparable to the text-only model, suggesting potential for improvements.

Abstract: Shared mobility systems, such as bike-sharing networks, play a crucial role in urban transportation. Identifying anomalies in these systems is essential for optimizing operations, improving service reliability, and enhancing user experience. This paper presents an interpretable anomaly detection framework that integrates multi-source data, including bike-sharing trip records, weather conditions, and public transit availability. The Isolation Forest algorithm is employed for unsupervised anomaly detection, along with the Depth-based Isolation Forest Feature Importance (DIFFI) algorithm providing interpretability. Results show that station-level analysis offers a robust understanding of anomalies, highlighting the influence of external factors such as adverse weather and limited transit availability. Our findings contribute to improving decision-making in shared mobility operations.

<title>SustainDiffusion: Optimising the Social and Environmental Sustainability of Stable Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Text-to-image generation models are widely used across numerous domains. Among these models, Stable Diffusion (SD) - an open-source text-to-image generation model - has become the most popular, producing over 12 billion images annually. However, the widespread use of these models raises concerns regarding their social and environmental sustainability.
  Aims: To reduce the harm that SD models may have on society and the environment, we introduce SustainDiffusion, a search-based approach designed to enhance the social and environmental sustainability of SD models.
  Method: SustainDiffusion searches the optimal combination of hyperparameters and prompt structures that can reduce gender and ethnic bias in generated images while also lowering the energy consumption required for image generation. Importantly, SustainDiffusion maintains image quality comparable to that of the original SD model.
  Results: We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of SustainDiffusion, testing it against six different baselines using 56 different prompts. Our results demonstrate that SustainDiffusion can reduce gender bias in SD3 by 68%, ethnic bias by 59%, and energy consumption (calculated as the sum of CPU and GPU energy) by 48%. Additionally, the outcomes produced by SustainDiffusion are consistent across multiple runs and can be generalised to various prompts.
  Conclusions: With SustainDiffusion, we demonstrate how enhancing the social and environmental sustainability of text-to-image generation models is possible without fine-tuning or changing the model's architecture.

<title>Missing value imputation with adversarial random forests -- MissARF</title>

Abstract: Handling missing values is a common challenge in biostatistical analyses, typically addressed by imputation methods. We propose a novel, fast, and easy-to-use imputation method called missing value imputation with adversarial random forests (MissARF), based on generative machine learning, that provides both single and multiple imputation. MissARF employs adversarial random forest (ARF) for density estimation and data synthesis. To impute a missing value of an observation, we condition on the non-missing values and sample from the estimated conditional distribution generated by ARF. Our experiments demonstrate that MissARF performs comparably to state-of-the-art single and multiple imputation methods in terms of imputation quality and fast runtime with no additional costs for multiple imputation.

<title>LINR-PCGC: Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for Point Cloud Geometry Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment. Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and 21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on https://huangwenjie2023.github.io/LINR-PCGC/.

<title>CoLD: Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing for Process Reward Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.15698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps, even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation, improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

Abstract: Receivers in standard signaling game models struggle with learning compositional information. Even when the signalers send compositional messages, the receivers do not interpret them compositionally. When information from one message component is lost or forgotten, the information from other components is also erased. In this paper I construct signaling game models in which genuine compositional understanding evolves. I present two new models: a minimalist receiver who only learns from the atomic messages of a signal, and a generalist receiver who learns from all of the available information. These models are in many ways simpler than previous alternatives, and allow the receivers to learn from the atomic components of messages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evaluated using diverse question types, e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, and short/long answers. This study answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance.

Abstract: Current benchmarks evaluating large language models (LLMs) in ophthalmology are limited in scope and disproportionately prioritise accuracy. We introduce BELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive evaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13 ophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and reasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we curated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse medical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset underwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard questions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the explanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by three senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) using accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore, BARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human experts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900 high-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC (260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public leaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and reporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out, evaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future models.

Abstract: Electric vehicles (EV) charging stations are one of the critical infrastructures needed to support the transition to renewable-energy-based mobility, but ensuring their reliability and efficiency requires effective anomaly detection to identify irregularities in charging behavior. However, in such a productive scenario, it is also crucial to determine the underlying cause behind the detected anomalies. To achieve this goal, this study investigates unsupervised anomaly detection techniques for EV charging infrastructure, integrating eXplainable Artificial Intelligence techniques to enhance interpretability and uncover root causes of anomalies.
  Using real-world sensors and charging session data, this work applies Isolation Forest to detect anomalies and employs the Depth-based Isolation Forest Feature Importance (DIFFI) method to identify the most important features contributing to such anomalies. The efficacy of the proposed approach is evaluated in a real industrial case.

Abstract: Collecting human-chatbot dialogues typically demands substantial manual effort and is time-consuming, which limits and poses challenges for research on conversational AI. In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless, maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a common challenge across all models.

Abstract: Generative machine learning models have revolutionized material discovery by capturing complex structure-property relationships, yet extending these approaches to the inverse design of three-dimensional metamaterials remains limited by computational complexity and underexplored design spaces due to the lack of expressive representations. Here, we present DiffuMeta, a generative framework integrating diffusion transformers with a novel algebraic language representation, encoding 3D geometries as mathematical sentences. This compact, unified parameterization spans diverse topologies while enabling direct application of transformers to structural design. DiffuMeta leverages diffusion models to generate novel shell structures with precisely targeted stress-strain responses under large deformations, accounting for buckling and contact while addressing the inherent one-to-many mapping by producing diverse solutions. Uniquely, our approach enables simultaneous control over multiple mechanical objectives, including linear and nonlinear responses beyond training domains. Experimental validation of fabricated structures further confirms the efficacy of our approach for accelerated design of metamaterials and structures with tailored properties.

Abstract: How does AI think about economic policy? While the use of large language models (LLMs) in economics is growing exponentially, their assumptions on economic issues remain a black box. This paper uses a conjoint experiment to tease out the main factors influencing LLMs' evaluation of economic policy. It finds that LLMs are most sensitive to unemployment, inequality, financial stability, and environmental harm and less sensitive to traditional macroeconomic concerns such as economic growth, inflation, and government debt. The results are remarkably consistent across scenarios and across models.

Abstract: Detecting stress in plants is crucial for both open-farm and controlled-environment agriculture. Biomolecules within plants serve as key stress indicators, offering vital markers for continuous health monitoring and early disease detection. Raman spectroscopy provides a powerful, non-invasive means to quantify these biomolecules through their molecular vibrational signatures. However, traditional Raman analysis relies on customized data-processing workflows that require fluorescence background removal and prior identification of Raman peaks of interest-introducing potential biases and inconsistencies. Here, we introduce DIVA (Deep-learning-based Investigation of Vibrational Raman spectra for plant-stress Analysis), a fully automated workflow based on a variational autoencoder. Unlike conventional approaches, DIVA processes native Raman spectra-including fluorescence backgrounds-without manual preprocessing, identifying and quantifying significant spectral features in an unbiased manner. We applied DIVA to detect a range of plant stresses, including abiotic (shading, high light intensity, high temperature) and biotic stressors (bacterial infections). By integrating deep learning with vibrational spectroscopy, DIVA paves the way for AI-driven plant health assessment, fostering more resilient and sustainable agricultural practices.

Abstract: We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for computational efficiency, and SwiGLU activation functions. A critical innovation is our custom 128,000-vocabulary byte-level BPE tokenizer, which achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis, we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models while using 53% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.

Abstract: While boundaries between data modalities are vanishing, the usual successful deep models are still challenged by simple ones in the time-series forecasting task. Our hypothesis is that this task needs models that are able to learn the data underlying dynamics. We propose to validate it through both systemic and empirical studies. We develop an original $\texttt{PRO-DYN}$ nomenclature to analyze existing models through the lens of dynamics. Two observations thus emerged: $\textbf{1}$. under-performing architectures learn dynamics at most partially, $\textbf{2}$. the location of the dynamics block at the model end is of prime importance. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm our observations on a set of performance-varying models with diverse backbones. Results support the need to incorporate a learnable dynamics block and its use as the final predictor.

Abstract: We present GravLensX, an innovative method for rendering black holes with gravitational lensing effects using neural networks. The methodology involves training neural networks to fit the spacetime around black holes and then employing these trained models to generate the path of light rays affected by gravitational lensing. This enables efficient and scalable simulations of black holes with optically thin accretion disks, significantly decreasing the time required for rendering compared to traditional methods. We validate our approach through extensive rendering of multiple black hole systems with superposed Kerr metric, demonstrating its capability to produce accurate visualizations with significantly $15\times$ reduced computational time.

Abstract: As Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) driven chatbots like Character.AI become embedded in adolescent life, they raise concerns about emotional dependence and digital overreliance. While studies have investigated the overreliance of adults on these chatbots, they have not investigated teens' interactions with chatbots with customizable personas. We analyzed 318 Reddit posts made by users self-reported as 13-17 years old on the Character.AI subreddit to understand patterns of overreliance. We found teens commonly begin using chatbots for emotional support or creative expression, but many develop strong attachments that interfere with offline relationships and daily routines. Their posts revealed recurring signs of psychological distress, cycles of relapse, and difficulty disengaging. Teens reported that their overreliance often ended when they reflect on the harm, return to in-person social settings, or become frustrated by platform restrictions. Based on the implications of our findings, we provide recommendations for future chatbot design so they can promote self-awareness, support real-world engagement, and involve teens in developing safer digital tools.

<title>Small LLMs Do Not Learn a Generalizable Theory of Mind via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced, human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks. This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.

Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS, ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.

<title>True Multimodal In-Context Learning Needs Attention to the Visual Context</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are available at https://chenxshuo.github.io/true-micl-colm .

Abstract: Among areas of software engineering where AI techniques -- particularly, Large Language Models -- seem poised to yield dramatic improvements, an attractive candidate is Automatic Program Repair (APR), the production of satisfactory corrections to software bugs. Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills?
  To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs.
  These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.

Abstract: Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space, allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as an invaluable solution in scenarios where real-world data collection and usage are limited by cost and scarcity. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in producing high-fidelity, domain-relevant samples across various fields. However, existing approaches that directly use LLMs to generate each record individually impose prohibitive time and cost burdens, particularly when large volumes of synthetic data are required. In this work, we propose a fast, cost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs to infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script. By automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text types, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently produce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model inference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional direct methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the burden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this methodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening development cycles and improving overall system efficiency. We believe our insights and lessons learned will aid researchers and practitioners seeking scalable, cost-effective solutions for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding maps natural language instructions to precise interface locations for autonomous interaction. Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to 6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap, we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames, constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames, realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching, dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160 manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS, establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently, diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce. Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at: https://diffusion-scaling.github.io.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm, which enables multiple and decentralized clients to collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central aggregator. FL can be a scalable machine learning solution in big data scenarios. Traditional FL relies on the trust assumption of the central aggregator, which forms cohorts of clients honestly. However, a malicious aggregator, in reality, could abandon and replace the client's training models, or insert fake clients, to manipulate the final training results. In this work, we introduce zkFL, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to tackle the issue of a malicious aggregator during the training model aggregation process. To guarantee the correct aggregation results, the aggregator provides a proof per round, demonstrating to the clients that the aggregator executes the intended behavior faithfully. To further reduce the verification cost of clients, we use blockchain to handle the proof in a zero-knowledge way, where miners (i.e., the participants validating and maintaining the blockchain data) can verify the proof without knowing the clients' local and aggregated models. The theoretical analysis and empirical results show that zkFL achieves better security and privacy than traditional FL, without modifying the underlying FL network structure or heavily compromising the training speed.

Abstract: Forests are crucial for ecological balance, but wildfires, a major cause of forest loss, pose significant risks. Fire weather indices, which assess wildfire risk and predict resource demands, are vital. With the rise of sensor networks in fields like healthcare and environmental monitoring, semantic sensor networks are increasingly used to gather climatic data such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity. However, processing these data streams to determine fire weather indices presents challenges, underscoring the growing importance of effective forest fire detection. This paper discusses using Apache Spark for early forest fire detection, enhancing fire risk prediction with meteorological and geographical data. Building on our previous development of Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontologies and Semantic Web Rules Language (SWRL) for managing forest fires in Monesterial Natural Park, we expanded SWRL to improve a Decision Support System (DSS) using a Large Language Models (LLMs) and Spark framework. We implemented real-time alerts with Spark streaming, tailored to various fire scenarios, and validated our approach using ontology metrics, query-based evaluations, LLMs score precision, F1 score, and recall measures.

Abstract: The development of autonomous agents increasingly relies on Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) to perform tasks described in natural language with GUI environments, such as websites, desktop computers, or mobile phones. Existing benchmarks for MLM agents in interactive environments are limited by their focus on a single environment, lack of detailed and generalized evaluation methods, and the complexities of constructing tasks and evaluators. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Crab, the first agent benchmark framework designed to support cross-environment tasks, incorporating a graph-based fine-grained evaluation method and an efficient mechanism for task and evaluator construction. Our framework supports multiple devices and can be easily extended to any environment with a Python interface. Leveraging Crab, we developed a cross-platform Crab Benchmark-v0 comprising 120 tasks in computer desktop and mobile phone environments. We evaluated four advanced MLMs using different single and multi-agent system configurations on this benchmark. The experimental results demonstrate that the single agent with GPT-4o achieves the best completion ratio of 38.01%. All framework code, agent code, and task datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/camel-ai/crab.

Abstract: This study introduces a LLMs powered multiagent ensemble method to address challenges in hallucination and data labeling, particularly in large-scale EHR datasets. Manual labeling of such datasets requires domain expertise and is labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and error-prone. To overcome this bottleneck, we developed an ensemble LLMs method and demonstrated its effectiveness in two real-world tasks: (1) labeling a large-scale unlabeled ECG dataset in MIMIC-IV; (2) identifying social determinants of health (SDOH) from the clinical notes of EHR. Trading off benefits and cost, we selected a pool of diverse open source LLMs with satisfactory performance. We treat each LLM's prediction as a vote and apply a mechanism of majority voting with minimal winning threshold for ensemble. We implemented an ensemble LLMs application for EHR data labeling tasks. By using the ensemble LLMs and natural language processing, we labeled MIMIC-IV ECG dataset of 623,566 ECG reports with an estimated accuracy of 98.2%. We applied the ensemble LLMs method to identify SDOH from social history sections of 1,405 EHR clinical notes, also achieving competitive performance. Our experiments show that the ensemble LLMs can outperform individual LLM even the best commercial one, and the method reduces hallucination errors. From the research, we found that (1) the ensemble LLMs method significantly reduces the time and effort required for labeling large-scale EHR data, automating the process with high accuracy and quality; (2) the method generalizes well to other text data labeling tasks, as shown by its application to SDOH identification; (3) the ensemble of a group of diverse LLMs can outperform or match the performance of the best individual LLM; and (4) the ensemble method substantially reduces hallucination errors. This approach provides a scalable and efficient solution to data-labeling challenges.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in visually interpreting medical time-series data. However, their general-purpose design can limit domain-specific precision, and the proprietary nature of many models poses challenges for fine-tuning on specialized clinical datasets. Conversely, small specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but lack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To address these complementary limitations, we introduce \ConMIL{} (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively synergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in identifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal prediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with statistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these interpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual inspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and sleep stage classification demonstrate that \ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy of LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and 71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16% using the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific models with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.

<title>Doing More with Less: A Survey on Routing Strategies for Resource Optimisation in Large Language Model-Based Systems</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, i.e. interconnected elements that include an LLM as a central component, such as conversational agents, are usually designed with monolithic, static architectures that rely on a single, general-purpose LLM to handle all user queries. However, these systems may be inefficient as different queries may require different levels of reasoning, domain knowledge or pre-processing. While generalist LLMs (e.g. GPT-4o, Claude-Sonnet) perform well across a wide range of tasks, they may incur significant financial, energy and computational costs. These costs may be disproportionate for simpler queries, resulting in unnecessary resource utilisation. A routing mechanism can therefore be employed to route queries to more appropriate components, such as smaller or specialised models, thereby improving efficiency and optimising resource consumption. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of routing strategies in LLM-based systems. Specifically, it reviews when, why, and how routing should be integrated into LLM pipelines to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance. We define the objectives to optimise, such as cost minimisation and performance maximisation, and discuss the timing of routing within the LLM workflow, whether it occurs before or after generation. We also detail the various implementation strategies, including similarity-based, supervised, reinforcement learning-based, and generative methods. Practical considerations such as industrial applications and current limitations are also examined, like standardising routing experiments, accounting for non-financial costs, and designing adaptive strategies.

<title>The Elicitation Game: Evaluating Capability Elicitation Techniques</title>

Abstract: Capability evaluations are required to understand and regulate AI systems that may be deployed or further developed. Therefore, it is important that evaluations provide an accurate estimation of an AI system's capabilities. However, in numerous cases, previously latent capabilities have been elicited from models, sometimes long after initial release. Accordingly, substantial efforts have been made to develop methods for eliciting latent capabilities from models. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of capability elicitation techniques by intentionally training model organisms -- language models with hidden capabilities that are revealed by a password. We introduce a novel method for training model organisms, based on circuit-breaking, which is more robust to elicitation techniques than standard password-locked models. We focus on elicitation techniques based on prompting and activation steering, and compare these to fine-tuning methods. Prompting techniques can elicit the actual capability of both password-locked and circuit-broken model organisms in the MCQA setting, while steering fails to do so. For a code-generation task, only fine-tuning can elicit the hidden capabilities of our novel model organism. Additionally, our results suggest that combining techniques improves elicitation. Still, if possible, fine-tuning should be the method of choice to improve the trustworthiness of capability evaluations.

<title>SensorChat: Answering Qualitative and Quantitative Questions during Long-Term Multimodal Sensor Interactions</title>

Abstract: Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for addressing users' personal concerns and providing health-related insights into their daily lives. When a user asks a question, the system automatically analyzes the full history of sensor data, extracts relevant information, and generates an appropriate response. However, existing systems are limited to short-duration (e.g., one minute) or low-frequency (e.g., daily step count) sensor data. In addition, they struggle with quantitative questions that require precise numerical answers. In this work, we introduce SensorChat, the first end-to-end QA system designed for daily life monitoring using long-duration, high-frequency time series data. Given raw sensor signals spanning multiple days and a user-defined natural language question, SensorChat generates semantically meaningful responses that directly address user concerns. SensorChat effectively handles both quantitative questions that require numerical precision and qualitative questions that require high-level reasoning to infer subjective insights. To achieve this, SensorChat uses an innovative three-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly. The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret human queries and generate responses. The intermediate querying stage extracts relevant information from the complete sensor data history. Real-world implementations demonstrate SensorChat's capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that SensorChat achieves 93% higher answer accuracy than the best performing state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Furthermore, a user study with eight volunteers highlights SensorChat's effectiveness in answering qualitative questions.

<title>Empowering LLMs with Logical Reasoning: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable successes on various tasks. However, recent studies have found that there are still significant challenges to the logical reasoning abilities of LLMs, which can be categorized into the following two aspects: (1) Logical question answering: LLMs often fail to generate the correct answer within a complex logical problem which requires sophisticated deductive, inductive or abductive reasoning given a collection of premises. (2) Logical consistency: LLMs are prone to producing responses contradicting themselves across different questions. For example, a state-of-the-art question-answering LLM Macaw, answers Yes to both questions Is a magpie a bird? and Does a bird have wings? but answers No to Does a magpie have wings?. To facilitate this research direction, we comprehensively investigate the most cutting-edge methods and propose a detailed taxonomy. Specifically, to accurately answer complex logic questions, previous methods can be categorized based on reliance on external solvers, prompts, and fine-tuning. To avoid logical contradictions, we discuss concepts and solutions of various logical consistencies, including implication, negation, transitivity, factuality consistencies, and their composites. In addition, we review commonly used benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics, and discuss promising research directions, such as extending to modal logic to account for uncertainty and developing efficient algorithms that simultaneously satisfy multiple logical consistencies.

Abstract: Policymakers increasingly use development cost and compute as proxies for AI capabilities and risks. Recent laws have introduced regulatory requirements for models or developers that are contingent on specific thresholds. However, technical ambiguities in how to perform this accounting create loopholes that can undermine regulatory effectiveness. We propose seven principles for designing AI cost and compute accounting standards that (1) reduce opportunities for strategic gaming, (2) avoid disincentivizing responsible risk mitigation, and (3) enable consistent implementation across companies and jurisdictions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown notable potential in code generation for optimization algorithms, unlocking exciting new opportunities. This paper examines how LLMs, rather than creating algorithms from scratch, can improve existing ones without the need for specialized expertise. To explore this potential, we selected 10 baseline optimization algorithms from various domains (metaheuristics, reinforcement learning, deterministic, and exact methods) to solve the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The results show that our simple methodology often results in LLM-generated algorithm variants that improve over the baseline algorithms in terms of solution quality, reduction in computational time, and simplification of code complexity, all without requiring specialized optimization knowledge or advanced algorithmic implementation skills.

Abstract: Is it possible to articulate a conception of consciousness that is compatible with the exotic characteristics of contemporary, disembodied AI systems, and that can stand up to philosophical scrutiny? How would subjective time and selfhood show up for an entity that conformed to such a conception? Trying to answer these questions, even metaphorically, stretches the language of consciousness to breaking point. Ultimately, the attempt yields something like emptiness, in the Buddhist sense, and helps to undermine our dualistic inclinations towards subjectivity and selfhood.

<title>A Library of LLM Intrinsics for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: In the developer community for large language models (LLMs), there is not yet a clean pattern analogous to a software library, to support very large scale collaboration. Even for the commonplace use case of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), it is not currently possible to write a RAG application against a well-defined set of APIs that are agreed upon by different LLM providers. Inspired by the idea of compiler intrinsics, we propose some elements of such a concept through introducing a library of LLM Intrinsics for RAG. An LLM intrinsic is defined as a capability that can be invoked through a well-defined API that is reasonably stable and independent of how the LLM intrinsic itself is implemented. The intrinsics in our library are released as LoRA adapters on HuggingFace, and through a software interface with clear structured input/output characteristics on top of vLLM as an inference platform, accompanied in both places with documentation and code. This article describes the intended usage, training details, and evaluations for each intrinsic, as well as compositions of multiple intrinsics.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has become increasingly important in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. Counterfactual (CF) explanations, a key approach in XAI, provide users with actionable insights by suggesting minimal modifications to input features that lead to different model outcomes. Despite significant advancements, existing CF generation methods often struggle to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness, limiting their real-world applicability. A widely adopted framework, Diverse Counterfactual Explanations (DiCE), emphasizes diversity but lacks robustness, making CF explanations sensitive to perturbations and domain constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce DiCE-Extended, an enhanced CF explanation framework that integrates multi-objective optimization techniques to improve robustness while maintaining interpretability. Our approach introduces a novel robustness metric based on the Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient, enabling stability under small input variations. Additionally, we refine CF generation using weighted loss components (lambda_p, lambda_d, lambda_r) to balance proximity, diversity, and robustness. We empirically validate DiCE-Extended on benchmark datasets (COMPAS, Lending Club, German Credit, Adult Income) across multiple ML backends (Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow). Results demonstrate improved CF validity, stability, and alignment with decision boundaries compared to standard DiCE-generated explanations. Our findings highlight the potential of DiCE-Extended in generating more reliable and interpretable CFs for high-stakes applications. Future work could explore adaptive optimization techniques and domain-specific constraints to further enhance CF generation in real-world scenarios

Abstract: Fast and effective incident response is essential to prevent adversarial cyberattacks. Autonomous Cyber Defense (ACD) aims to automate incident response through Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents that plan and execute actions. Most ACD approaches focus on single-agent scenarios and leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, ACD RL-trained agents depend on costly training, and their reasoning is not always explainable or transferable. Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these concerns by providing explainable actions in general security contexts. Researchers have explored LLM agents for ACD but have not evaluated them on multi-agent scenarios or interacting with other ACD agents. In this paper, we show the first study on how LLMs perform in multi-agent ACD environments by proposing a new integration to the CybORG CAGE 4 environment. We examine how ACD teams of LLM and RL agents can interact by proposing a novel communication protocol. Our results highlight the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs and RL and help us identify promising research directions to create, train, and deploy future teams of ACD agents.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion have revolutionized visual content creation across various applications, including advertising, personalized media, and design prototyping. However, crafting effective textual prompts to guide these models remains challenging, often requiring extensive trial and error. Existing prompt inversion approaches, such as soft and hard prompt techniques, are not so effective due to the limited interpretability and incoherent prompt generation. To address these issues, we propose Visually Guided Decoding (VGD), a gradient-free approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and CLIP-based guidance to generate coherent and semantically aligned prompts. In essence, VGD utilizes the robust text generation capabilities of LLMs to produce human-readable prompts. Further, by employing CLIP scores to ensure alignment with user-specified visual concepts, VGD enhances the interpretability, generalization, and flexibility of prompt generation without the need for additional training. Our experiments demonstrate that VGD outperforms existing prompt inversion techniques in generating understandable and contextually relevant prompts, facilitating more intuitive and controllable interactions with text-to-image models.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the real world. However, existing works neglect the real-world challenges for temporal reasoning: (1) intensive temporal information, (2) fast-changing event dynamics, and (3) complex temporal dependencies in social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-level benchmark TIME, designed for temporal reasoning in real-world scenarios. TIME consists of 38,522 QA pairs, covering 3 levels with 11 fine-grained sub-tasks. This benchmark encompasses 3 sub-datasets reflecting different real-world challenges: TIME-Wiki, TIME-News, and TIME-Dial. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning models and non-reasoning models. And we conducted an in-depth analysis of temporal reasoning performance across diverse real-world scenarios and tasks, and summarized the impact of test-time scaling on temporal reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we release TIME-Lite, a human-annotated subset to foster future research and standardized evaluation in temporal reasoning. The code is available at https://github.com/sylvain-wei/TIME , and the dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SylvainWei/TIME .

Abstract: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.

<title>The Ultimate Test of Superintelligent AI Agents: Can an AI Balance Care and Control in Asymmetric Relationships?</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important, and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents, while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key research directions, including the development of simulation environments for testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation within multi-agent systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands robust tools for automated survey-generation. However, current large language model (LLM)-based methods often lack in-depth analysis, structural coherence, and reliable citations. To address these limitations, we introduce SciSage, a multi-agent framework employing a reflect-when-you-write paradigm. SciSage features a hierarchical Reflector agent that critically evaluates drafts at outline, section, and document levels, collaborating with specialized agents for query interpretation, content retrieval, and refinement. We also release SurveyScope, a rigorously curated benchmark of 46 high-impact papers (2020-2025) across 11 computer science domains, with strict recency and citation-based quality controls. Evaluations demonstrate that SciSage outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (LLM x MapReduce-V2, AutoSurvey), achieving +1.73 points in document coherence and +32% in citation F1 scores. Human evaluations reveal mixed outcomes (3 wins vs. 7 losses against human-written surveys), but highlight SciSage's strengths in topical breadth and retrieval efficiency. Overall, SciSage offers a promising foundation for research-assistive writing tools.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are accelerating scientific idea generation, but rigorously evaluating these numerous, often superficial, AI-generated propositions for novelty and factual accuracy is a critical bottleneck; manual verification is too slow. Existing validation methods are inadequate: LLMs as standalone verifiers may hallucinate and lack domain knowledge (our findings show 60% unawareness of relevant papers in specific domains), while traditional citation networks lack explicit causality and narrative surveys are unstructured. This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured, verifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To address this,we introduce \textbf{THE-Tree} (\textbf{T}echnology \textbf{H}istory \textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that constructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific literature. THE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths. During its node expansion, it utilizes a novel "Think-Verbalize-Cite-Verify" process: an LLM proposes potential advancements and cites supporting literature. Critically, each proposed evolutionary link is then validated for logical coherence and evidential support by a recovered natural language inference mechanism that interrogates the cited literature, ensuring that each step is grounded. We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains and release a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering 27k papers to foster further research. Experiments demonstrate that i) in graph completion, our THE-Tree improves hit@1 by 8% to 14% across multiple models compared to traditional citation networks; ii) for predicting future scientific developments, it improves hit@1 metric by nearly 10%; and iii) when combined with other methods, it boosts the performance of evaluating important scientific papers by almost 100%.

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) often suffer from an extreme long-tail distribution of dialogue data, causing a strong bias toward head-frequency blockbusters that sacrifices diversity and exacerbates the cold-start problem. An empirical analysis of DCRS and statistics on the REDIAL corpus show that only 10% of head movies account for nearly half of all mentions, whereas about 70% of tail movies receive merely 26% of the attention. This imbalance gives rise to three critical challenges: head over-fitting, body representation drift, and tail sparsity. To address these issues, we propose LumiCRS, an end-to-end framework that mitigates long-tail imbalance through three mutually reinforcing layers: (i) an Adaptive Comprehensive Focal Loss (ACFL) that dynamically adjusts class weights and focusing factors to curb head over-fitting and reduce popularity bias; (ii) Prototype Learning for Long-Tail Recommendation, which selects semantic, affective, and contextual prototypes to guide clustering and stabilize body and tail representations; and (iii) a GPT-4o-driven prototype-guided dialogue augmentation module that automatically generates diverse long-tail conversational snippets to alleviate tail sparsity and distribution shift. Together, these strategies enable LumiCRS to markedly improve recommendation accuracy, diversity, and fairness: on the REDIAL and INSPIRED benchmarks, LumiCRS boosts Recall@10 and Tail-Recall@10 by 7-15% over fifteen strong baselines, while human evaluations confirm superior fluency, informativeness, and long-tail relevance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-layer collaboration in building an efficient and fair long-tail conversational recommender.

We show how (deontic) modal operators can be expressed elegantly using default negation (negation-as-failure) and strong negation present in answer set programming (ASP). We propose using global constraints of ASP to represent obligations and impermissibilities of deontic modal logic. We show that our proposed representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being elegantly resolved.

Abstract: A large class of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) methods employs a machine learner to process the input entities, while relying on a reasoner based on First-Order Logic to represent and process more complex relationships among the entities. A fundamental role for these methods is played by the process of logic grounding, which determines the relevant substitutions for the logic rules using a (sub)set of entities. Some NeSy methods use an exhaustive derivation of all possible substitutions, preserving the full expressive power of the logic knowledge. This leads to a combinatorial explosion in the number of ground formulas to consider and, therefore, strongly limits their scalability. Other methods rely on heuristic-based selective derivations, which are generally more computationally efficient, but lack a justification and provide no guarantees of preserving the information provided to and returned by the reasoner. Taking inspiration from multi-hop symbolic reasoning, this paper proposes a parametrized family of grounding methods generalizing classic Backward Chaining. Different selections within this family allow us to obtain commonly employed grounding methods as special cases, and to control the trade-off between expressiveness and scalability of the reasoner. The experimental results show that the selection of the grounding criterion is often as important as the NeSy method itself.

Abstract: We introduce and study the weakly single-crossing domain on trees which is a generalization of the well-studied single-crossing domain in social choice theory. We design a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing preference profiles which belong to this domain. We then develop an efficient elicitation algorithm for this domain which works even if the preferences can be accessed only sequentially and the underlying single-crossing tree structure is not known beforehand. We also prove matching lower bound on the query complexity of our elicitation algorithm when the number of voters is large compared to the number of candidates. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega(m^2\log n)$ on the number of queries that any algorithm needs to ask to elicit single crossing profile when random queries are allowed. This resolves an open question in an earlier paper and proves optimality of their preference elicitation algorithm when random queries are allowed.

Abstract: Abductive forgetting is removing variables from a logical formula while maintaining its abductive explanations. It is carried in two alternative ways depending on its intended application. Both differ from the usual forgetting, which maintains consequences rather than explanations. Differently from that, abductive forgetting from a propositional formula may not be expressed by any propositional formula. A necessary and sufficient condition tells when it is. Checking it is $\Pi^p_3$-complete. A way to guarantee expressibility of abductive forgetting is to switch from propositional to default logic. Another is to introduce new variables.

<title>PFB-Diff: Progressive Feature Blending Diffusion for Text-driven Image Editing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16894</link>

arXiv:2306.16894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated their ability to generate diverse and high-quality images, sparking considerable interest in their potential for real image editing applications. However, existing diffusion-based approaches for local image editing often suffer from undesired artifacts due to the latent-level blending of the noised target images and diffusion latent variables, which lack the necessary semantics for maintaining image consistency. To address these issues, we propose PFB-Diff, a Progressive Feature Blending method for Diffusion-based image editing. Unlike previous methods, PFB-Diff seamlessly integrates text-guided generated content into the target image through multi-level feature blending. The rich semantics encoded in deep features and the progressive blending scheme from high to low levels ensure semantic coherence and high quality in edited images. Additionally, we introduce an attention masking mechanism in the cross-attention layers to confine the impact of specific words to desired regions, further improving the performance of background editing and multi-object replacement. PFB-Diff can effectively address various editing tasks, including object/background replacement and object attribute editing. Our method demonstrates its superior performance in terms of editing accuracy and image quality without the need for fine-tuning or training. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/CMACH508/PFB-Diff.

Abstract: Dialogue systems (DS), including the task-oriented dialogue system (TOD) and the open-domain dialogue system (ODD), have always been a fundamental task in natural language processing (NLP), allowing various applications in practice. Owing to sophisticated training and well-designed model architecture, language models (LM) are usually adopted as the necessary backbone to build the dialogue system. Consequently, every breakthrough in LM brings about a shift in learning paradigm and research attention within dialogue system, especially the appearance of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we take a deep look at the history of the dialogue system, especially its special relationship with the advancements of language models. Thus, our survey offers a systematic perspective, categorizing different stages in a chronological order aligned with LM breakthroughs, providing a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research outcomes. What's more, we turn our attention to emerging topics and engage in a discussion on open challenges, providing valuable insights into the future directions for LLM-based dialogue systems. In summary, this survey delves into the dynamic interplay between language models and dialogue systems, unraveling the evolutionary path of this essential relationship. Through this exploration, we pave the way for a deeper comprehension of the field, guiding future developments in LM-based dialogue systems.

<title>Defending Against Unforeseen Failure Modes with Latent Adversarial Training</title>

Abstract: Despite extensive diagnostics and debugging by developers, AI systems sometimes exhibit harmful unintended behaviors. Finding and fixing these is challenging because the attack surface is so large -- it is not tractable to exhaustively search for inputs that may elicit harmful behaviors. Red-teaming and adversarial training (AT) are commonly used to improve robustness, however, they empirically struggle to fix failure modes that differ from the attacks used during training. In this work, we utilize latent adversarial training (LAT) to defend against vulnerabilities without leveraging knowledge of what they are or using inputs that elicit them. LAT makes use of the compressed, abstract, and structured latent representations of concepts that the network actually uses for prediction. Here, we use it to defend against failure modes without examples that elicit them. Specifically, we use LAT to remove backdoors and defend against held-out classes of adversarial attacks. We show in image classification, text classification, and text generation tasks that LAT usually improves both robustness to novel attacks and performance on clean data relative to AT. This suggests that LAT can be a promising tool for defending against failure modes that are not explicitly identified by developers.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.

Abstract: Mobile device control agents can largely enhance user interactions and productivity by automating daily tasks. However, despite growing interest in developing practical agents, the absence of a commonly adopted benchmark in this area makes it challenging to quantify scientific progress. In this work, we introduce B-MoCA: a novel benchmark with interactive environments for evaluating and developing mobile device control agents. To create a realistic benchmark, we develop B-MoCA based on the Android operating system and define 131 common daily tasks. Importantly, we incorporate a randomization feature that changes the configurations of mobile devices, including user interface layouts and language settings, to assess generalization performance. We benchmark diverse agents, including agents employing large language models (LLMs) or multi-modal LLMs as well as agents trained with imitation learning using human expert demonstrations. While these agents demonstrate proficiency in executing straightforward tasks, their poor performance on complex tasks highlights significant opportunities for future research to improve effectiveness.

Abstract: Human perception involves decomposing complex multi-object scenes into time-static object appearance (i.e., size, shape, color) and time-varying object motion (i.e., position, velocity, acceleration). For machines to achieve human-like intelligence in real-world interactions, understanding these physical properties of objects is essential, forming the foundation for dynamic video prediction. While recent advancements in object-centric transformers have demonstrated potential in video prediction, they primarily focus on object appearance, often overlooking motion dynamics, which is crucial for modeling dynamic interactions and maintaining temporal consistency in complex environments. To address these limitations, we propose OCK, a dynamic video prediction model leveraging object-centric kinematics and object slots. We introduce a novel component named Object Kinematics that comprises explicit object motions, serving as an additional attribute beyond conventional appearance features to model dynamic scenes. The Object Kinematics are integrated into various OCK mechanisms, enabling spatiotemporal prediction of complex object interactions over long video sequences. Our model demonstrates superior performance in handling complex scenes with intricate object attributes and motions, highlighting its potential for applicability in vision-related dynamics learning tasks.

<title>Oversmoothing Alleviation in Graph Neural Networks: A Survey and Unified View</title>

Abstract: Oversmoothing is a common challenge in learning graph neural networks (GNN), where, as layers increase, embedding features learned from GNNs quickly become similar or indistinguishable, making them incapable of differentiating network proximity. A GNN with shallow layer architectures can only learn short-term relation or localized structure information, limiting its power of learning long-term connection, evidenced by their inferior learning performance on heterophilous graphs. Tackling oversmoothing is crucial for harnessing deep-layer architectures for GNNs. To date, many methods have been proposed to alleviate oversmoothing. The vast difference behind their design principles, combined with graph complications, make it difficult to understand and even compare the difference between different approaches in tackling the oversmoothing. In this paper, we propose ATNPA, a unified view with five key steps: Augmentation, Transformation, Normalization, Propagation, and Aggregation, to summarize GNN oversmoothing alleviation approaches. We first propose a taxonomy for GNN oversmoothing alleviation which includes three themes to tackle oversmoothing. After that, we separate all methods into six categories, followed by detailed reviews of representative methods, including their relation to ATNPA, and discussion of their niche, strength, and weakness. The review not only draws an in-depth understanding of existing methods in the field but also shows a clear road map for future study.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL) with experience replay, experiences stored in a replay buffer influence the RL agent's performance. Information about how these experiences influence the agent's performance is valuable for various purposes, such as identifying experiences that negatively influence underperforming agents. One method for estimating the influence of experiences is the leave-one-out (LOO) method. However, this method is usually computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we present Policy Iteration with Turn-over Dropout (PIToD), which efficiently estimates the influence of experiences. We evaluate how correctly PIToD estimates the influence of experiences and its efficiency compared to LOO. We then apply PIToD to amend underperforming RL agents, i.e., we use PIToD to estimate negatively influential experiences for the RL agents and to delete the influence of these experiences. We show that RL agents' performance is significantly improved via amendments with PIToD.

Abstract: Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in performing different tasks is crucial for understanding their strengths and weaknesses. This paper presents Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), grounded on human cognitive principles and designed to assess LLMs by examining the cognitive demands of various tasks. The HPT utilizes the Hierarchical Prompting Framework (HPF), which structures five unique prompting strategies in a hierarchical order based on their cognitive requirement on LLMs when compared to human mental capabilities. It assesses the complexity of tasks with the Hierarchical Prompting Index (HPI), which demonstrates the cognitive competencies of LLMs across diverse datasets and offers insights into the cognitive demands that datasets place on different LLMs. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation of an LLMs problem solving abilities and the intricacy of a dataset, offering a standardized metric for task complexity. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets and LLMs show that HPF enhances LLM performance by 2% to 63% compared to baseline performance, with GSM8k being the most cognitively complex task among reasoning and coding tasks with an average HPI of 3.20 confirming the effectiveness of HPT. To support future research and reproducibility in this domain, the implementations of HPT and HPF are available here.

<title>Towards the Next Frontier in Speech Representation Learning Using Disentanglement</title>

Abstract: The popular frameworks for self-supervised learning of speech representations have largely focused on frame-level masked prediction of speech regions. While this has shown promising downstream task performance for speech recognition and related tasks, this has largely ignored factors of speech that are encoded at coarser level, like characteristics of the speaker or channel that remain consistent through-out a speech utterance. In this work, we propose a framework for Learning Disentangled Self Supervised (termed as Learn2Diss) representations of speech, which consists of frame-level and an utterance-level encoder modules. The two encoders are initially learned independently, where the frame-level model is largely inspired by existing self supervision techniques, thereby learning pseudo-phonemic representations, while the utterance-level encoder is inspired by constrastive learning of pooled embeddings, thereby learning pseudo-speaker representations. The joint learning of these two modules consists of disentangling the two encoders using a mutual information based criterion. With several downstream evaluation experiments, we show that the proposed Learn2Diss achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks, with the frame-level encoder representations improving semantic tasks, while the utterance-level representations improve non-semantic tasks.

<title>How to Leverage Predictive Uncertainty Estimates for Reducing Catastrophic Forgetting in Online Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Many real-world applications require machine-learning models to be able to deal with non-stationary data distributions and thus learn autonomously over an extended period of time, often in an online setting. One of the main challenges in this scenario is the so-called catastrophic forgetting (CF) for which the learning model tends to focus on the most recent tasks while experiencing predictive degradation on older ones. In the online setting, the most effective solutions employ a fixed-size memory buffer to store old samples used for replay when training on new tasks. Many approaches have been presented to tackle this problem. However, it is not clear how predictive uncertainty information for memory management can be leveraged in the most effective manner and conflicting strategies are proposed to populate the memory. Are the easiest-to-forget or the easiest-to-remember samples more effective in combating CF? Starting from the intuition that predictive uncertainty provides an idea of the samples' location in the decision space, this work presents an in-depth analysis of different uncertainty estimates and strategies for populating the memory. The investigation provides a better understanding of the characteristics data points should have for alleviating CF. Then, we propose an alternative method for estimating predictive uncertainty via the generalised variance induced by the negative log-likelihood. Finally, we demonstrate that the use of predictive uncertainty measures helps in reducing CF in different settings.

Abstract: The field of Neural-Symbolic (NeSy) systems is growing rapidly. Proposed approaches show great promise in achieving symbiotic unions of neural and symbolic methods. However, a unifying framework is needed to organize common NeSy modeling patterns and develop general learning approaches. In this paper, we introduce Neural-Symbolic Energy-Based Models (NeSy-EBMs), a unifying mathematical framework for discriminative and generative NeSy modeling. Importantly, NeSy-EBMs allow the derivation of general expressions for gradients of prominent learning losses, and we introduce a suite of four learning approaches that leverage methods from multiple domains, including bilevel and stochastic policy optimization. Finally, we ground the NeSy-EBM framework with Neural Probabilistic Soft Logic (NeuPSL), an open-source NeSy-EBM library designed for scalability and expressivity, facilitating the real-world application of NeSy systems. Through extensive empirical analysis across multiple datasets, we demonstrate the practical advantages of NeSy-EBMs in various tasks, including image classification, graph node labeling, autonomous vehicle situation awareness, and question answering.

<title>Why Does New Knowledge Create Messy Ripple Effects in LLMs?</title>

Abstract: Extensive previous research has focused on post-training knowledge editing (KE) for language models (LMs) to ensure that knowledge remains accurate and up-to-date. One desired property and open question in KE is to let edited LMs correctly handle ripple effects, where LM is expected to answer its logically related knowledge accurately. In this paper, we answer the question of why most KE methods still create messy ripple effects. We conduct extensive analysis and identify a salient indicator, GradSim, that effectively reveals when and why updated knowledge ripples in LMs. GradSim is computed by the cosine similarity between gradients of the original fact and its related knowledge. We observe a strong positive correlation between ripple effect performance and GradSim across different LMs, KE methods, and evaluation metrics. Further investigations into three counter-intuitive failure cases (Negation, Over-Ripple, Multi-Lingual) of ripple effects demonstrate that these failures are often associated with very low GradSim. This finding validates that GradSim is an effective indicator of when knowledge ripples in LMs.

Abstract: General-purpose object placement is a fundamental capability of an intelligent generalist robot: being capable of rearranging objects following precise human instructions even in novel environments. This work is dedicated to achieving general-purpose object placement with ``something something'' instructions. Specifically, we break the entire process down into three parts, including object localization, goal imagination and robot control, and propose a method named SPORT. SPORT leverages a pre-trained large vision model for broad semantic reasoning about objects, and learns a diffusion-based pose estimator to ensure physically-realistic results in 3D space. Only object types (movable or reference) are communicated between these two parts, which brings two benefits. One is that we can fully leverage the powerful ability of open-set object recognition and localization since no specific fine-tuning is needed for the robotic scenario. Moreover, the diffusion-based estimator only need to ``imagine" the object poses after the placement, while no necessity for their semantic information. Thus the training burden is greatly reduced and no massive training is required. The training data for the goal pose estimation is collected in simulation and annotated by using GPT-4. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. SPORT can not only generate promising 3D goal poses for unseen simulated objects, but also be seamlessly applied to real-world settings.

Abstract: High-level automation is increasingly critical in AI, driven by rapid advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents. However, LLMs, despite their general reasoning power, struggle significantly in specialized, data-sensitive tasks such as designing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). This difficulty arises from (1) the inherent knowledge gaps in modeling the intricate, varying relationships between graph properties and suitable architectures and (2) the external noise from misleading descriptive inputs, often resulting in generic or even misleading model suggestions. Achieving proficiency in designing data-aware models -- defined as the meta-level capability to systematically accumulate, interpret, and apply data-specific design knowledge -- remains challenging for existing automated approaches, due to their inefficient construction and application of meta-knowledge. To achieve the meta-level proficiency, we propose DesiGNN, a knowledge-centered framework that systematically converts past model design experiences into structured, fine-grained knowledge priors well fitted to meta-learning with LLMs. To account for the inherent variability and external noise, DesiGNN aligns empirical property filtering from extensive benchmarks with adaptive elicitation of literature insights via LLMs. By constructing a solid meta-knowledge between unseen graph understanding and known effective architecture patterns, DesiGNN can deliver top-5.77% initial model proposals for unseen datasets within seconds, and achieve consistently superior performance with minimal search costs against baselines.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged to mitigate the computational demands of large-scale models. Within computer vision, adapter-based PEFT methods are often favored over prompt-based approaches like Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) due to the latter's performance and efficiency limitations. Our analysis reveals that VPT's shortcomings stem from its prompt deployment strategy, which can distort the model's inherent self-attention mechanism. To address this, we propose Cross Visual Prompt Tuning (CVPT). CVPT introduces a cross-attention module to directly model interactions between prompts and image tokens. This design decouples the prompts from the input sequence, preserving the original self-attention integrity while enabling efficient feature integration. Furthermore, we employ a weight-sharing mechanism for cross-attention initialization, which enhances representative capability without a large parameter overhead. Extensive experiments across 25 datasets show that CVPT significantly outperforms VPT. For instance, on the VTAB-1K benchmark, CVPT achieves over 4% higher average accuracy, rivaling leading adapter-based methods in both performance and efficiency. Our work confirms that prompt-based methods can achieve exceptional results in visual fine-tuning. The code is available at https://github.com/Lingyun0419/CVPT

However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.

Abstract: Modern listwise recommendation systems need to consider both long-term user perceptions and short-term interest shifts. Reinforcement learning can be applied on recommendation to study such a problem but is also subject to large search space, sparse user feedback and long interactive latency. Motivated by recent progress in hierarchical reinforcement learning, we propose a novel framework called mccHRL to provide different levels of temporal abstraction on listwise recommendation. Within the hierarchical framework, the high-level agent studies the evolution of user perception, while the low-level agent produces the item selection policy by modeling the process as a sequential decision-making problem. We argue that such framework has a well-defined decomposition of the outra-session context and the intra-session context, which are encoded by the high-level and low-level agents, respectively. To verify this argument, we implement both a simulator-based environment and an industrial dataset-based experiment. Results observe significant performance improvement by our method, compared with several well-known baselines. Data and codes have been made public.

<title>The unknotting number, hard unknot diagrams, and reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: We have developed a reinforcement learning agent that often finds a minimal sequence of unknotting crossing changes for a knot diagram with up to 200 crossings, hence giving an upper bound on the unknotting number. We have used this to determine the unknotting number of 57k knots. We took diagrams of connected sums of such knots with oppositely signed signatures, where the summands were overlaid. The agent has found examples where several of the crossing changes in an unknotting collection of crossings result in hyperbolic knots. Based on this, we have shown that, given knots $K$ and $K'$ that satisfy some mild assumptions, there is a diagram of their connected sum and $u(K) + u(K')$ unknotting crossings such that changing any one of them results in a prime knot. As a by-product, we have obtained a dataset of 2.6 million distinct hard unknot diagrams; most of them under 35 crossings. Assuming the additivity of the unknotting number, we have determined the unknotting number of 43 at most 12-crossing knots for which the unknotting number is unknown.

<title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283</link>

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.

Abstract: Recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results due to the powerful generative prior they leverage from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. However, abstract textual prompts are limited in providing global textural or shape information, which results in the texture generation methods producing blurry or inconsistent patterns. To tackle this, we present FlexiTex, embedding rich information via visual guidance to generate a high-quality texture. The core of FlexiTex is the Visual Guidance Enhancement module, which incorporates more specific information from visual guidance to reduce ambiguity in the text prompt and preserve high-frequency details. To further enhance the visual guidance, we introduce a Direction-Aware Adaptation module that automatically designs direction prompts based on different camera poses, avoiding the Janus problem and maintaining semantically global consistency. Benefiting from the visual guidance, FlexiTex produces quantitatively and qualitatively sound results, demonstrating its potential to advance texture generation for real-world applications.

Abstract: The challenging deployment of compute- and memory-intensive methods from Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based Continual Learning (CL) underscores the critical need for a paradigm shift towards more efficient approaches. Neuromorphic Continual Learning (NCL) appears as an emerging solution, by leveraging the principles of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) which enable efficient CL algorithms executed in dynamically-changed environments with resource-constrained computing systems. Motivated by the need for a holistic study of NCL, in this survey, we first provide a detailed background on CL, encompassing the desiderata, settings, metrics, scenario taxonomy, Online Continual Learning (OCL) paradigm, recent DNN-based methods to address catastrophic forgetting (CF). Then, we analyze these methods considering CL desiderata, computational and memory costs, as well as network complexity, hence emphasizing the need for energy-efficient CL. Afterward, we provide background of low-power neuromorphic systems including encoding techniques, neuronal dynamics, network architectures, learning rules, hardware processors, software and hardware frameworks, datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation metrics. Then, this survey comprehensively reviews and analyzes state-of-the-art in NCL. The key ideas, implementation frameworks, and performance assessments are also provided. This survey covers several hybrid approaches that combine supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. It also covers optimization techniques including SNN operations reduction, weight quantization, and knowledge distillation. Then, this survey discusses the progress of real-world NCL applications. Finally, this paper provides a future perspective on the open research challenges for NCL, since the purpose of this study is to be useful for the wider neuromorphic AI research community and to inspire future research in bio-plausible OCL.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions is crucial for their utility, honesty, and safety. Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a popular approach to achieve this alignment, but it faces challenges in computational efficiency and training stability. Recent methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) have proposed offline alternatives to RLHF, simplifying the process by reparameterizing the reward function. However, DPO depends on a potentially suboptimal reference model, and SimPO's assumption of a fixed target reward margin may lead to suboptimal decisions in diverse data settings. In this work, we propose $\alpha$-DPO, an adaptive preference optimization algorithm designed to address these limitations by introducing a dynamic reward margin. Specifically, $\alpha$-DPO employs an adaptive preference distribution, balancing the policy model and the reference model to achieve personalized reward margins. We provide theoretical guarantees for $\alpha$-DPO, demonstrating its effectiveness as a surrogate optimization objective and its ability to balance alignment and diversity through KL divergence control. Empirical evaluations on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard show that $\alpha$-DPO consistently outperforms DPO and SimPO across various model settings, establishing it as a robust approach for fine-tuning LLMs. Our method achieves significant improvements in win rates, highlighting its potential as a powerful tool for LLM alignment.

Abstract: Generating detailed descriptions from multiple cameras and viewpoints is challenging due to the complex and inconsistent nature of visual data. In this paper, we introduce PerspectiveNet, a lightweight yet efficient model for generating long descriptions across multiple camera views. Our approach utilizes a vision encoder, a compact connector module to convert visual features into a fixed-size tensor, and large language models (LLMs) to harness the strong natural language generation capabilities of LLMs. The connector module is designed with three main goals: mapping visual features onto LLM embeddings, emphasizing key information needed for description generation, and producing a fixed-size feature matrix. Additionally, we augment our solution with a secondary task, the correct frame sequence detection, enabling the model to search for the correct sequence of frames to generate descriptions. Finally, we integrate the connector module, the secondary task, the LLM, and a visual feature extraction model into a single architecture, which is trained for the Traffic Safety Description and Analysis task. This task requires generating detailed, fine-grained descriptions of events from multiple cameras and viewpoints. The resulting model is lightweight, ensuring efficient training and inference, while remaining highly effective.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) during ultrasound-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is critical for effective treatment but remains challenging due to acoustic artifacts, small lesion size, and anatomical variability. In this study, we propose DualSwinUnet++, a dual-decoder transformer-based architecture designed to enhance PTMC segmentation by incorporating thyroid gland context. DualSwinUnet++ employs independent linear projection heads for each decoder and a residual information flow mechanism that passes intermediate features from the first (thyroid) decoder to the second (PTMC) decoder via concatenation and transformation. These design choices allow the model to condition tumor prediction explicitly on gland morphology without shared gradient interference. Trained on a clinical ultrasound dataset with 691 annotated RFA images and evaluated against state-of-the-art models, DualSwinUnet++ achieves superior Dice and Jaccard scores while maintaining sub-200ms inference latency. The results demonstrate the model's suitability for near real-time surgical assistance and its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy in challenging PTMC cases.

Abstract: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches typically evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or through exact matches with predefined closed knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods are limited due to their reliance on evaluation metrics originally designed for other purposes and constraints from closed knowledge sources. In this work, we introduce \textbf{\textcolor{skyblue}{Ev\textsuperscript{2}}\textcolor{orangebrown}{R}} which combines the strengths of reference-based evaluation and verdict-level proxy scoring. Ev\textsuperscript{2}R jointly assesses how well the evidence aligns with the gold references and how reliably it supports the verdict, addressing the shortcomings of prior methods. We evaluate Ev\textsuperscript{2}R against three types of evidence evaluation approaches: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less baselines. Assessments against human ratings and adversarial tests demonstrate that Ev\textsuperscript{2}R consistently outperforms existing scoring approaches in accuracy and robustness. It achieves stronger correlation with human judgments and greater robustness to adversarial perturbations, establishing it as a reliable metric for evidence evaluation in AFC.\footnote{Code is available at \href{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}{https://github.com/mubasharaak/fc-evidence-evaluation}.}

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), grounding and referring capabilities have gained increasing attention for achieving detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, these capabilities still remain underdeveloped in visual document understanding due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Referring data engine (DOGR-Engine), which generates two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: (1) multi-granular parsing data to improve text localization and recognition, and (2) instruction-tuning data to activate MLLMs' grounding and referring capabilities in dialogue and reasoning. Using the DOGR-Engine, we construct DOGR-Bench, a benchmark covering seven grounding and referring tasks across three document types (chart, poster, and PDF document), offering a comprehensive evaluation of fine-grained document understanding. Leveraging the generated data, we further develop DOGR, a strong baseline model that excels in text localization and recognition, while precisely grounds and refers to key textual information during conversation and reasoning, thereby advancing document understanding to a finer granularity and enable flexible interaction paradigms.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, practitioners face significant challenges when making RAG deployment decisions. While existing research prioritizes algorithmic innovations, a systematic gap persists in understanding fundamental engineering trade-offs that determine RAG success. We present the first comprehensive study of three universal RAG deployment decisions: whether to deploy RAG, how much information to retrieve, and how to integrate retrieved knowledge effectively. Through systematic experiments across three LLMs and six datasets spanning question answering and code generation tasks, we reveal critical insights: (1) RAG deployment must be highly selective, with variable recall thresholds and failure modes affecting up to 12.6\% of samples even with perfect documents. (2) Optimal retrieval volume exhibits task-dependent behavior QA tasks show universal patterns (5-10 documents optimal) while code generation requires scenario-specific optimization. (3) Knowledge integration effectiveness depends on task and model characteristics, with code generation benefiting significantly from prompting methods while question answering shows minimal improvement. These findings demonstrate that universal RAG strategies prove inadequate. Effective RAG systems require context-aware design decisions based on task characteristics and model capabilities. Our analysis provides evidence-based guidance for practitioners and establishes foundational insights for principled RAG deployment.

Abstract: Video Virtual Try-on aims to seamlessly transfer a reference garment onto a target person in a video while preserving both visual fidelity and temporal coherence. Existing methods typically rely on inpainting masks to define the try-on area, enabling accurate garment transfer for simple scenes (e.g., in-shop videos). However, these mask-based approaches struggle with complex real-world scenarios, as overly large and inconsistent masks often destroy spatial-temporal information, leading to distorted results. Mask-free methods alleviate this issue but face challenges in accurately determining the try-on area, especially for videos with dynamic body movements. To address these limitations, we propose PEMF-VTO, a novel Point-Enhanced Mask-Free Video Virtual Try-On framework that leverages sparse point alignments to explicitly guide garment transfer. Our key innovation is the introduction of point-enhanced guidance, which provides flexible and reliable control over both spatial-level garment transfer and temporal-level video coherence. Specifically, we design a Point-Enhanced Transformer (PET) with two core components: Point-Enhanced Spatial Attention (PSA), which uses frame-cloth point alignments to precisely guide garment transfer, and Point-Enhanced Temporal Attention (PTA), which leverages frame-frame point correspondences to enhance temporal coherence and ensure smooth transitions across frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PEMF-VTO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, generating more natural, coherent, and visually appealing try-on videos, particularly for challenging in-the-wild scenarios.

Abstract: Game-theoretic scenarios have become pivotal in evaluating the social intelligence of Large Language Model (LLM)-based social agents. While numerous studies have explored these agents in such settings, there is a lack of a comprehensive survey summarizing the current progress. To address this gap, we systematically review existing research on LLM-based social agents within game-theoretic scenarios. Our survey organizes the findings into three core components: Game Framework, Social Agent, and Evaluation Protocol. The game framework encompasses diverse game scenarios, ranging from choice-focusing to communication-focusing games. The social agent part explores agents' preferences, beliefs, and reasoning abilities, as well as their interactions and synergistic effects on decision-making. The evaluation protocol covers both game-agnostic and game-specific metrics for assessing agent performance. Additionally, we analyze the performance of current social agents across various game scenarios. By reflecting on the current research and identifying future research directions, this survey provides insights to advance the development and evaluation of social agents in game-theoretic scenarios.

Abstract: Purpose: We present an updated study evaluating the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering radiation oncology physics questions, focusing on the recently released models.
  Methods: A set of 100 multiple-choice radiation oncology physics questions, previously created by a well-experienced physicist, was used for this study. The answer options of the questions were randomly shuffled to create "new" exam sets. Five LLMs -- OpenAI o1-preview, GPT-4o, LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet -- with the versions released before September 30, 2024, were queried using these new exam sets. To evaluate their deductive reasoning ability, the correct answer options in the questions were replaced with "None of the above." Then, the explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts were used to test if this strategy improved their reasoning ability. The performance of the LLMs was compared with the answers from medical physicists.
  Results: All models demonstrated expert-level performance on these questions, with o1-preview even surpassing medical physicists with a majority vote. When replacing the correct answer options with 'None of the above', all models exhibited a considerable decline in performance, suggesting room for improvement. The explain-first and step-by-step instruction prompts helped enhance the reasoning ability of the LLaMA 3.1 (405B), Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet models.
  Conclusion: These recently released LLMs demonstrated expert-level performance in answering radiation oncology physics questions, exhibiting great potential to assist in radiation oncology physics education and training.

<title>CGP-Tuning: Structure-Aware Soft Prompt Tuning for Code Vulnerability Detection</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed as powerful tools for detecting software vulnerabilities, where task-specific fine-tuning is typically employed to provide vulnerability-specific knowledge to the LLMs. However, existing fine-tuning techniques often treat source code as plain text, losing the graph-based structural information inherent in code.
  Graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning addresses this by translating the structural information into contextual cues that the LLM can understand. However, current methods are primarily designed for general graph-related tasks and focus more on adjacency information, they fall short in preserving the rich semantic information (e.g., control/data flow) within code graphs. They also fail to ensure computational efficiency while capturing graph-text interactions in their cross-modal alignment module.
  This paper presents CGP-Tuning, a new code graph-enhanced, structure-aware soft prompt tuning method for vulnerability detection. CGP-Tuning introduces type-aware embeddings to capture the rich semantic information within code graphs, along with an efficient cross-modal alignment module that achieves linear computational costs while incorporating graph-text interactions. It is evaluated on the latest DiverseVul dataset and three advanced open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeGemma, and Qwen2.5-Coder. Experimental results show that CGP-Tuning delivers model-agnostic improvements and maintains practical inference speed, surpassing the best graph-enhanced soft prompt tuning baseline by an average of four percentage points and outperforming non-tuned zero-shot prompting by 15 percentage points.

Abstract: This paper introduces HEPPO-GAE, an FPGA-based accelerator designed to optimize the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) stage in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Unlike previous approaches that focused on trajectory collection and actor-critic updates, HEPPO-GAE addresses GAE's computational demands with a parallel, pipelined architecture implemented on a single System-on-Chip (SoC). This design allows for the adaptation of various hardware accelerators tailored for different PPO phases. A key innovation is our strategic standardization technique, which combines dynamic reward standardization and block standardization for values, followed by 8-bit uniform quantization. This method stabilizes learning, enhances performance, and manages memory bottlenecks, achieving a 4x reduction in memory usage and a 1.5x increase in cumulative rewards. We propose a solution on a single SoC device with programmable logic and embedded processors, delivering throughput orders of magnitude higher than traditional CPU-GPU systems. Our single-chip solution minimizes communication latency and throughput bottlenecks, significantly boosting PPO training efficiency. Experimental results show a 30% increase in PPO speed and a substantial reduction in memory access time, underscoring HEPPO-GAE's potential for broad applicability in hardware-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Autoregressive and recurrent networks have achieved remarkable progress across various fields, from weather forecasting to molecular generation and Large Language Models. Despite their strong predictive capabilities, these models lack a rigorous framework for addressing uncertainty, which is key in scientific applications such as PDE solving, molecular generation and Machine Learning Force Fields. To address this shortcoming we present BARNN: a variational Bayesian Autoregressive and Recurrent Neural Network. BARNNs aim to provide a principled way to turn any autoregressive or recurrent model into its Bayesian version. BARNN is based on the variational dropout method, allowing to apply it to large recurrent neural networks as well. We also introduce a temporal version of the "Variational Mixtures of Posteriors" prior (tVAMP-prior) to make Bayesian inference efficient and well-calibrated. Extensive experiments on PDE modelling and molecular generation demonstrate that BARNN not only achieves comparable or superior accuracy compared to existing methods, but also excels in uncertainty quantification and modelling long-range dependencies.

Abstract: We consider learning outcomes in games with carryover effects between rounds: when outcomes in the present round affect the game in the future. An important example of such systems is routers in networking, as they use simple learning algorithms to find the best way to deliver packets to their desired destination. This simple, myopic, and distributed decision process makes large queuing systems easy to operate, but at the same time, the system needs more capacity than would be required if all traffic were centrally coordinated. Gaitonde and Tardos (EC 2020 and JACM 2023) initiated the study of such systems, modeling them as an infinitely repeated game in which routers compete for servers and the system maintains a state (the number of packets held at each queue) that results from outcomes of previous rounds. However, their model assumes that servers have no buffers at all, so routers have to resend all packets that were not served successfully, which makes their system model unrealistic. They show that in their model, even with hugely increased server capacity relative to what is needed in the centrally coordinated case, ensuring that the system is stable requires the use of timestamps and priority for older packets.
  We consider a system with two important changes, which make the model more realistic and allow for much higher traffic rates: first, we add a very small buffer to each server, allowing the server to hold on to a single packet to be served later (if it fails to serve it immediately), and second, we do not require timestamps or priority to older packets. Using theoretical analysis and simulations, we show that when queues are learning, a small constant-factor increase in server capacity, compared to what would be needed if centrally coordinating, suffices to keep the system stable, even if servers select randomly among packets arriving simultaneously.

Abstract: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) encode interwoven scientific knowledge, using chemical elements and LLaMA-series models as a case study. We identify a 3D spiral structure in the hidden states that aligns with the conceptual structure of the periodic table, suggesting that LLMs can reflect the geometric organization of scientific concepts learned from text. Linear probing reveals that middle layers encode continuous, overlapping attributes that enable indirect recall, while deeper layers sharpen categorical distinctions and incorporate linguistic context. These findings suggest that LLMs represent symbolic knowledge not as isolated facts, but as structured geometric manifolds that intertwine semantic information across layers. We hope this work inspires further exploration of how LLMs represent and reason about scientific knowledge, particularly in domains such as materials science.

Abstract: Rice is one of the most widely cultivated crops globally and has been developed into numerous varieties. The quality of rice during cultivation is primarily determined by its cultivar and characteristics. Traditionally, rice classification and quality assessment rely on manual visual inspection, a process that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. However, with advancements in machine vision technology, automating rice classification and quality evaluation based on its cultivar and characteristics has become increasingly feasible, enhancing both accuracy and efficiency. This study proposes a real-time evaluation mechanism for comprehensive rice grain assessment, integrating a one-stage object detection approach, a deep convolutional neural network, and traditional machine learning techniques. The proposed framework enables rice variety identification, grain completeness grading, and grain chalkiness evaluation. The rice grain dataset used in this study comprises approximately 20,000 images from six widely cultivated rice varieties in China. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 99.14% in the object detection task and an accuracy of 97.89% in the classification task. Furthermore, the framework attains an average accuracy of 97.56% in grain completeness grading within the same rice variety, contributing to an effective quality evaluation system.

Abstract: The task of automatically coding the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in the medical field has been well-established and has received much attention. Automatic coding of the ICD in the medical field has been successful in English but faces challenges when dealing with Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs). The first issue lies in the difficulty of extracting disease code-related information from Chinese EMRs, primarily due to the concise writing style and specific internal structure of the EMRs. The second problem is that previous methods have failed to leverage the disease-based multi-axial knowledge and lack of association with the corresponding clinical evidence. This paper introduces a novel framework called MKE-Coder: Multi-axial Knowledge with Evidence verification in ICD coding for Chinese EMRs. Initially, we identify candidate codes for the diagnosis and categorize each of them into knowledge under four coding axes.Subsequently, we retrieve corresponding clinical evidence from the comprehensive content of EMRs and filter credible evidence through a scoring model. Finally, to ensure the validity of the candidate code, we propose an inference module based on the masked language modeling strategy. This module verifies that all the axis knowledge associated with the candidate code is supported by evidence and provides recommendations accordingly. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we conduct experiments using a large-scale Chinese EMR dataset collected from various hospitals. The experimental results demonstrate that MKE-Coder exhibits significant superiority in the task of automatic ICD coding based on Chinese EMRs. In the practical evaluation of our method within simulated real coding scenarios, it has been demonstrated that our approach significantly aids coders in enhancing both their coding accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on some tasks, while exhibiting distinctly non-human-like behaviors on others. This raises the question of how well the LLM's learned representations align with human representations. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to study representation alignment: we adopt a method from research on activation steering to identify neurons responsible for specific concepts (e.g., ''cat'') and then analyze the corresponding activation patterns. We find that LLM representations captured this way closely align with human representations inferred from behavioral data, matching inter-human alignment levels. Our approach significantly outperforms the alignment captured by word embeddings, which have been the focus of prior work on human-LLM alignment. Additionally, our approach enables a more granular view of how LLMs represent concepts -- we show that LLMs organize concepts in a way that mirrors human concept organization.

<title>Steering into New Embedding Spaces: Analyzing Cross-Lingual Alignment Induced by Model Interventions in Multilingual Language Models</title>

Abstract: Aligned representations across languages is a desired property in multilingual large language models (mLLMs), as alignment can improve performance in cross-lingual tasks. Typically alignment requires fine-tuning a model, which is computationally expensive, and sizable language data, which often may not be available. A data-efficient alternative to fine-tuning is model interventions -- a method for manipulating model activations to steer generation into the desired direction. We analyze the effect of a popular intervention (finding experts) on the alignment of cross-lingual representations in mLLMs. We identify the neurons to manipulate for a given language and introspect the embedding space of mLLMs pre- and post-manipulation. We show that modifying the mLLM's activations changes its embedding space such that cross-lingual alignment is enhanced. Further, we show that the changes to the embedding space translate into improved downstream performance on retrieval tasks, with up to 2x improvements in top-1 accuracy on cross-lingual retrieval.

Abstract: Automatic evaluation of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems relies on fine-grained dimensions like faithfulness and relevance, as judged by expert human annotators. Meta-evaluation benchmarks support the development of automatic evaluators that correlate well with human judgement. However, existing benchmarks predominantly focus on English or use translated data, which fails to capture cultural nuances. A native approach provides a better representation of the end user experience.
  In this work, we develop a Multilingual End-to-end Meta-Evaluation RAG benchmark (MEMERAG). Our benchmark builds on the popular MIRACL dataset, using native-language questions and generating responses with diverse large language models (LLMs), which are then assessed by expert annotators for faithfulness and relevance. We describe our annotation process and show that it achieves high inter-annotator agreement. We then analyse the performance of the answer-generating LLMs across languages as per the human evaluators. Finally we apply the dataset to our main use-case which is to benchmark multilingual automatic evaluators (LLM-as-a-judge). We show that our benchmark can reliably identify improvements offered by advanced prompting techniques and LLMs. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/amazon-science/MEMERAG

Abstract: Benchmark contamination poses a significant challenge to the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluations, as it is difficult to assert whether a model has been trained on a test set. We introduce a solution to this problem by watermarking benchmarks before their release. The embedding involves reformulating the original questions with a watermarked LLM, in a way that does not alter the benchmark utility. During evaluation, we can detect ``radioactivity'', \ie traces that the text watermarks leave in the model during training, using a theoretically grounded statistical test. We test our method by pre-training 1B models from scratch on 10B tokens with controlled benchmark contamination, and validate its effectiveness in detecting contamination on ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and MMLU. Results show similar benchmark utility post-watermarking and successful contamination detection when models are contaminated enough to enhance performance, \eg $p$-val $=10^{-3}$ for +5$\%$ on ARC-Easy.

<title>Winning Big with Small Models: Knowledge Distillation vs. Self-Training for Reducing Hallucination in Product QA Agents</title>

arXiv:2502.19545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in customer support is constrained by hallucination (generating false information) and the high cost of proprietary models. To address these challenges, we propose a retrieval-augmented question-answering (QA) pipeline and explore how to balance human input and automation. Using a dataset of questions about a Samsung Smart TV user manual, we demonstrate that synthetic data generated by LLMs outperforms crowdsourced data in reducing hallucination in finetuned models. We also compare self-training (fine-tuning models on their own outputs) and knowledge distillation (fine-tuning on stronger models' outputs, e.g., GPT-4o), and find that self-training achieves comparable hallucination reduction. We conjecture that this surprising finding can be attributed to increased exposure bias issues in the knowledge distillation case and support this conjecture with post hoc analysis. We also improve robustness to unanswerable questions and retrieval failures with contextualized "I don't know" responses. These findings show that scalable, cost-efficient QA systems can be built using synthetic data and self-training with open-source models, reducing reliance on proprietary tools or costly human annotations.

Abstract: Brain foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in computational neuroscience, offering a revolutionary framework for processing diverse neural signals across different brain-related tasks. These models leverage large-scale pre-training techniques, allowing them to generalize effectively across multiple scenarios, tasks, and modalities, thus overcoming the traditional limitations faced by conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in understanding complex brain data. By tapping into the power of pretrained models, BFMs provide a means to process neural data in a more unified manner, enabling advanced analysis and discovery in the field of neuroscience. In this survey, we define BFMs for the first time, providing a clear and concise framework for constructing and utilizing these models in various applications. We also examine the key principles and methodologies for developing these models, shedding light on how they transform the landscape of neural signal processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in BFMs, covering the most recent methodological innovations, novel views of application areas, and challenges in the field. Notably, we highlight the future directions and key challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of BFMs. These challenges include improving the quality of brain data, optimizing model architecture for better generalization, increasing training efficiency, and enhancing the interpretability and robustness of BFMs in real-world applications.

<title>Can Optical Denoising Clean Sonar Images? A Benchmark and Fusion Approach</title>

Abstract: Object detection in sonar images is crucial for underwater robotics applications including autonomous navigation and resource exploration. However, complex noise patterns inherent in sonar imagery, particularly speckle, reverberation, and non-Gaussian noise, significantly degrade detection accuracy. While denoising techniques have achieved remarkable success in optical imaging, their applicability to sonar data remains underexplored. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of nine state-of-the-art deep denoising models with distinct architectures, including Neighbor2Neighbor with varying noise parameters, Blind2Unblind with different noise configurations, and DSPNet, for sonar image preprocessing. We establish a rigorous benchmark using five publicly available sonar datasets and assess their impact on four representative detection algorithms: YOLOX, Faster R-CNN, SSD300, and SSDMobileNetV2. Our evaluation addresses three unresolved questions: first, how effectively optical denoising architectures transfer to sonar data; second, which model families perform best against sonar noise; and third, whether denoising truly improves detection accuracy in practical pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that while denoising generally improves detection performance, effectiveness varies across methods due to their inherent biases toward specific noise types. To leverage complementary denoising effects, we propose a mutually-supervised multi-source denoising fusion framework where outputs from different denoisers mutually supervise each other at the pixel level, creating a synergistic framework that produces cleaner images.

Abstract: Can transformers learn to perform algorithmic tasks reliably across previously unseen input/output domains? While pre-trained language models show solid accuracy on benchmarks incorporating algorithmic reasoning, assessing the reliability of these results necessitates an ability to distinguish genuine algorithmic understanding from memorization. In this paper, we propose AttentionSpan, an algorithmic benchmark comprising five tasks of infinite input domains where we can disentangle and trace the correct, robust algorithm necessary for the task. This allows us to assess (i) models' ability to extrapolate to unseen types of inputs, including new lengths, value ranges or input domains, but also (ii)to assess the robustness of their learned mechanisms. By analyzing attention maps and performing targeted interventions, we show that attention mechanism directly causes failures in extrapolation. We make the implementation of all our tasks and interpretability methods publicly available at https://github.com/michalspiegel/AttentionSpan .

<title>Too Much to Trust? Measuring the Security and Cognitive Impacts of Explainability in AI-Driven SOCs</title>

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) holds significant promise for enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of AI-driven threat detection in Security Operations Centers (SOCs). However, identifying the appropriate level and format of explanation, particularly in environments that demand rapid decision-making under high-stakes conditions, remains a complex and underexplored challenge. To address this gap, we conducted a three-month mixed-methods study combining an online survey (N1=248) with in-depth interviews (N2=24) to examine (1) how SOC analysts conceptualize AI-generated explanations and (2) which types of explanations are perceived as actionable and trustworthy across different analyst roles. Our findings reveal that participants were consistently willing to accept XAI outputs, even in cases of lower predictive accuracy, when explanations were perceived as relevant and evidence-backed. Analysts repeatedly emphasized the importance of understanding the rationale behind AI decisions, expressing a strong preference for contextual depth over a mere presentation of outcomes on dashboards. Building on these insights, this study re-evaluates current explanation methods within security contexts and demonstrates that role-aware, context-rich XAI designs aligned with SOC workflows can substantially improve practical utility. Such tailored explainability enhances analyst comprehension, increases triage efficiency, and supports more confident responses to evolving threats.

<title>OMNISEC: LLM-Driven Provenance-based Intrusion Detection via Retrieval-Augmented Behavior Prompting</title>

arXiv:2503.03108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Provenance-based Intrusion Detection Systems (PIDSes) have been widely used for endpoint threat analysis. These studies can be broadly categorized into rule-based detection systems and learning-based detection systems. Among these, due to the evolution of attack techniques, rules cannot dynamically model all the characteristics of attackers. As a result, such systems often face false negatives. Learning-based detection systems are further divided into supervised learning and anomaly detection. The scarcity of attack samples hinders the usability and effectiveness of supervised learning-based detection systems in practical applications. Anomaly-based detection systems face a massive false positive problem because they cannot distinguish between changes in normal behavior and real attack behavior. The alert results of detection systems are closely related to the manual labor costs of subsequent security analysts. To reduce manual analysis time, we propose OMNISEC, which applies large language models (LLMs) to anomaly-based intrusion detection systems via retrieval-augmented behavior prompting. OMNISEC can identify abnormal nodes and corresponding abnormal events by constructing suspicious nodes and rare paths. By combining two external knowledge bases, OMNISEC uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enable the LLM to determine whether abnormal behavior is a real attack. Finally, OMNISEC can reconstruct the attack graph and restore the complete attack behavior chain of the attacker's intrusion. Experimental results show that OMNISEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods on public benchmark datasets.

<title>Symbolic Mixture-of-Experts: Adaptive Skill-based Routing for Heterogeneous Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05641</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.05641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining existing pre-trained expert LLMs is a promising avenue for scalably tackling large-scale and diverse tasks. However, selecting task-level experts is often too coarse-grained, as heterogeneous tasks may require different expertise per instance. To enable adaptive instance-level mixing of pre-trained LLM experts, we propose Symbolic-MoE, a symbolic, text-based, and gradient-free Mixture-of-Experts framework. Symbolic-MoE takes a fine-grained approach to selection by emphasizing skills, e.g., algebra in math or molecular biology in biomedical reasoning. We propose a skill-based recruiting strategy that dynamically selects the most relevant set of expert LLMs for diverse reasoning tasks based on their strengths. Each selected expert then generates its own reasoning, resulting in k outputs from k experts, which are then synthesized into a final high-quality response by an aggregator chosen based on its ability to integrate diverse reasoning outputs. We show that Symbolic-MoE's instance-level expert selection improves performance by a large margin but -- when implemented naively -- can introduce a high computational overhead due to the need for constant model loading and offloading. To address this, we implement a batch strategy that groups instances based on their assigned experts, loading each model only once. This allows us to integrate 16 expert models on 1 GPU with a time cost comparable to or better than prior multi-agent baselines using 4 GPUs. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks (MMLU-Pro, GPQA, AIME, and MedMCQA), we show that Symbolic-MoE beats strong LLMs like GPT4o-mini, as well as multi-agent approaches, with an absolute avg. gain of 8.15% over the best multi-agent baseline. Moreover, Symbolic-MoE generalizes well to unseen tasks and removes the need for expensive multi-round discussions, outperforming discussion baselines with less computation.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generation have driven interest in generating personalized human images that depict specific identities from reference images. Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they are generally limited to single-ID scenarios and offer insufficient facial editability. We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the base model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which applies feature-space manipulation to effectively disentangle and reconfigure facial motion and identity features, supporting flexible facial editing. 3) a task-decoupled training paradigm that reduces data dependency, together with VariFace-10k, a curated dataset of 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability. Our code will be released at https://github.com/ByteCat-bot/DynamicID.

<title>PLADIS: Pushing the Limits of Attention in Diffusion Models at Inference Time by Leveraging Sparsity</title>

arXiv:2503.07677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive results in generating high-quality conditional samples using guidance techniques such as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, existing methods often require additional training or neural function evaluations (NFEs), making them incompatible with guidance-distilled models. Also, they rely on heuristic approaches that need identifying target layers. In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method, termed PLADIS, which boosts pre-trained models (U-Net/Transformer) by leveraging sparse attention. Specifically, we extrapolate query-key correlations using softmax and its sparse counterpart in the cross-attention layer during inference, without requiring extra training or NFEs. By leveraging the noise robustness of sparse attention, our PLADIS unleashes the latent potential of text-to-image diffusion models, enabling them to excel in areas where they once struggled with newfound effectiveness. It integrates seamlessly with guidance techniques, including guidance-distilled models. Extensive experiments show notable improvements in text alignment and human preference, offering a highly efficient and universally applicable solution.

Abstract: Efficiently acquiring external knowledge and up-to-date information is essential for effective reasoning and text generation in large language models (LLMs). Prompting advanced LLMs with reasoning capabilities to use search engines during inference is often suboptimal, as the LLM might not fully possess the capability on how to interact optimally with the search engine. This paper introduces Search-R1, an extension of reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning frameworks where the LLM learns to autonomously generate (multiple) search queries during step-by-step reasoning with real-time retrieval. Search-R1 optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn search interactions, leveraging retrieved token masking for stable RL training and a simple outcome-based reward function. Experiments on seven question-answering datasets show that Search-R1 improves performance by 41% (Qwen2.5-7B) and 20% (Qwen2.5-3B) over various RAG baselines under the same setting. This paper further provides empirical insights into RL optimization methods, LLM choices, and response length dynamics in retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Abstract: Unifying diverse image generation tasks within a single framework remains a fundamental challenge in visual generation. While large language models (LLMs) achieve unification through task-agnostic data and generation, existing visual generation models fail to meet these principles. Current approaches either rely on per-task datasets and large-scale training or adapt pre-trained image models with task-specific modifications, limiting their generalizability. In this work, we explore video models as a foundation for unified image generation, leveraging their inherent ability to model temporal correlations. We introduce RealGeneral, a novel framework that reformulates image generation as a conditional frame prediction task, analogous to in-context learning in LLMs. To bridge the gap between video models and condition-image pairs, we propose (1) a Unified Conditional Embedding module for multi-modal alignment and (2) a Unified Stream DiT Block with decoupled adaptive LayerNorm and attention mask to mitigate cross-modal interference. RealGeneral demonstrates effectiveness in multiple important visual generation tasks, e.g., it achieves a 14.5% improvement in subject similarity for customized generation and a 10% enhancement in image quality for canny-to-image task.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance has become a staple for conditional generation with denoising diffusion models. However, a comprehensive understanding of classifier-free guidance is still missing. In this work, we carry out an empirical study to provide a fresh perspective on classifier-free guidance. Concretely, instead of solely focusing on classifier-free guidance, we trace back to the root, i.e., classifier guidance, pinpoint the key assumption for the derivation, and conduct a systematic study to understand the role of the classifier. We find that both classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance achieve conditional generation by pushing the denoising diffusion trajectories away from decision boundaries, i.e., areas where conditional information is usually entangled and is hard to learn. Based on this classifier-centric understanding, we propose a generic postprocessing step built upon flow-matching to shrink the gap between the learned distribution for a pre-trained denoising diffusion model and the real data distribution, majorly around the decision boundaries. Experiments on various datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: This paper reports the first brain-inspired large language model (BriLLM). This is a non-Transformer, non-GPT, non-traditional machine learning input-output controlled generative language model. The model is based on the Signal Fully-connected flowing (SiFu) definition on the directed graph in terms of the neural network, and has the interpretability of all nodes on the graph of the whole model, instead of the traditional machine learning model that only has limited interpretability at the input and output ends. In the language model scenario, the token is defined as a node in the graph. A randomly shaped or user-defined signal flow flows between nodes on the principle of "least resistance" along paths. The next token or node to be predicted or generated is the target of the signal flow. As a language model, BriLLM theoretically supports infinitely long $n$-gram models when the model size is independent of the input and predicted length of the model. The model's working signal flow provides the possibility of recall activation and innate multi-modal support similar to the cognitive patterns of the human brain. At present, we released the first BriLLM version in Chinese, with 4000 tokens, 32-dimensional node width, 16-token long sequence prediction ability, and language model prediction performance comparable to GPT-1. More computing power will help us explore the infinite possibilities depicted above.

<title>Fine-Tuning Diffusion Generative Models via Rich Preference Optimization</title>

arXiv:2503.11720v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Rich Preference Optimization (RPO), a novel pipeline that leverages rich feedback signals to improve the curation of preference pairs for fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models. Traditional methods, like Diffusion-DPO, often rely solely on reward model labeling, which can be opaque, offer limited insights into the rationale behind preferences, and are prone to issues such as reward hacking or overfitting. In contrast, our approach begins with generating detailed critiques of synthesized images, from which we extract reliable and actionable image editing instructions. By implementing these instructions, we create refined images, resulting in synthetic, informative preference pairs that serve as enhanced tuning datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline and the resulting datasets in fine-tuning state-of-the-art diffusion models. Our code is available at https://github.com/Diffusion-RLHF/RPO.

Abstract: A vast amount of instruction tuning data is crucial for the impressive performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but the associated computational costs and data collection demands during supervised fine-tuning make it impractical for most researchers. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to leverage all distributed data and training resources to reduce the overhead of joint training. However, most existing methods assume a fixed number of tasks, while in real-world scenarios, clients continuously encounter new knowledge and often struggle to retain old tasks due to memory constraints. In this work, we introduce the Federated Continual Instruction Tuning (FCIT) benchmark to model this real-world challenge. Our benchmark includes two realistic scenarios, encompassing four different settings and twelve carefully curated instruction tuning datasets. To address the challenges posed by FCIT, we propose dynamic knowledge organization to effectively integrate updates from different tasks during training and subspace selective activation to allocate task-specific output during inference. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances model performance across varying levels of data heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting. Code and dataset are released at https://github.com/Ghy0501/FCIT.

<title>Sampling Decisions</title>

arXiv:2503.14549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling decisions from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI-driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in stochastic optimal control. It extends the continuous-space, continuous-time Path Integral Diffusion sampling technique of [Behjoo, Chertkov 2025] to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network (GFN) framework of [Bengio, et al 2021]. In its most basic form an explicit formulation that does not require Neural Networks (NNs), DF leverages the linear solvability of the underlying MDP [Todorov, 2007] to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse-time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model -- compare DF to Metropolis-Hastings to quantify its efficiency, discuss potential NN-based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.

<title>TruthLens: Explainable DeepFake Detection for Face Manipulated and Fully Synthetic Data</title>

arXiv:2503.15867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting DeepFakes has become a crucial research area as the widespread use of AI image generators enables the effortless creation of face-manipulated and fully synthetic content, yet existing methods are often limited to binary classification (real vs. fake) and lack interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose TruthLens, a novel and highly generalizable framework for DeepFake detection that not only determines whether an image is real or fake but also provides detailed textual reasoning for its predictions. Unlike traditional methods, TruthLens effectively handles both face-manipulated DeepFakes and fully AI-generated content while addressing fine-grained queries such as "Does the eyes/nose/mouth look real or fake?"
  The architecture of TruthLens combines the global contextual understanding of multimodal large language models like PaliGemma2 with the localized feature extraction capabilities of vision-only models like DINOv2. This hybrid design leverages the complementary strengths of both models, enabling robust detection of subtle manipulations while maintaining interpretability. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that TruthLens outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy (by 2-14%) and explainability, in both in-domain and cross-data settings, generalizing effectively across traditional and emerging manipulation techniques.

<title>A Study of LLMs' Preferences for Libraries and Programming Languages</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, influencing users' choices of libraries and programming languages in critical real-world projects. However, little is known about their systematic biases or preferences toward certain libraries and programming languages, which can significantly impact software development practices. To fill this gap, we perform the first empirical study of LLMs' preferences for libraries and programming languages when generating code, covering eight diverse LLMs. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit a strong tendency to overuse widely adopted libraries such as NumPy; in up to 48% of cases, this usage is unnecessary and deviates from the ground-truth solutions. LLMs also exhibit a significant preference toward Python as their default language. For high-performance project initialisation tasks where Python is not the optimal language, it remains the dominant choice in 58% of cases, and Rust is not used a single time. These results indicate that LLMs may prioritise familiarity and popularity over suitability and task-specific optimality. This will introduce security vulnerabilities and technical debt, and limit exposure to newly developed, better-suited tools and languages. Understanding and addressing these biases is essential for the responsible integration of LLMs into software development workflows.

Abstract: Intent, typically clearly formulated and planned, functions as a cognitive framework for communication and problem-solving. This paper introduces the concept of Speaking with Intent (SWI) in large language models (LLMs), where the explicitly generated intent encapsulates the model's underlying intention and provides high-level planning to guide subsequent analysis and action. By emulating deliberate and purposeful thoughts in the human mind, SWI is hypothesized to enhance the reasoning capabilities and generation quality of LLMs. Extensive experiments on text summarization, multi-task question answering, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of Speaking with Intent over direct generation without explicit intent. Further analysis corroborates the generalizability of SWI under different experimental settings. Moreover, human evaluations verify the coherence, effectiveness, and interpretability of the intent produced by SWI. The promising results in enhancing LLMs with explicit intents pave a new avenue for boosting LLMs' generation and reasoning abilities with cognitive notions.

Abstract: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains underdiagnosed in clinical settings, presenting opportunities for automated detection to identify patients. This study evaluates natural language processing approaches for detecting PTSD from clinical interview transcripts. We compared general and mental health-specific transformer models (BERT/RoBERTa), embedding-based methods (SentenceBERT/LLaMA), and large language model prompting strategies (zero-shot/few-shot/chain-of-thought) using the DAIC-WOZ dataset. Domain-specific end-to-end models significantly outperformed general models (Mental-RoBERTa AUPRC=0.675+/-0.084 vs. RoBERTa-base 0.599+/-0.145). SentenceBERT embeddings with neural networks achieved the highest overall performance (AUPRC=0.758+/-0.128). Few-shot prompting using DSM-5 criteria yielded competitive results with two examples (AUPRC=0.737). Performance varied significantly across symptom severity and comorbidity status with depression, with higher accuracy for severe PTSD cases and patients with comorbid depression. Our findings highlight the potential of domain-adapted embeddings and LLMs for scalable screening while underscoring the need for improved detection of nuanced presentations and offering insights for developing clinically viable AI tools for PTSD assessment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.03022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior work on in-context copying has shown the existence of induction heads, which attend to and promote individual tokens during copying. In this work we discover a new type of induction head: concept-level induction heads, which copy entire lexical units instead of individual tokens. Concept induction heads learn to attend to the ends of multi-token words throughout training, working in parallel with token-level induction heads to copy meaningful text. We show that these heads are responsible for semantic tasks like word-level translation, whereas token induction heads are vital for tasks that can only be done verbatim (like copying nonsense tokens). These two "routes" operate independently: we show that ablation of token induction heads causes models to paraphrase where they would otherwise copy verbatim. By patching concept induction head outputs, we find that they contain language-independent word representations that mediate natural language translation, suggesting that LLMs represent abstract word meanings independent of language or form.

Abstract: Training effective AI agents for multi-turn interactions requires high-quality data that captures realistic human-agent dynamics, yet such data is scarce and expensive to collect manually. We introduce APIGen-MT, a two-phase framework that generates verifiable and diverse multi-turn agent data. In the first phase, our agentic pipeline produces detailed task blueprints with ground-truth actions, leveraging a committee of LLM reviewers and iterative feedback loops. These blueprints are then transformed into complete interaction trajectories through simulated human-agent interplay. We train a family of models -- the xLAM-2-fc-r series with sizes ranging from 1B to 70B parameters. Our models outperform frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 on $\tau$-bench and BFCL benchmarks, with the smaller models surpassing their larger counterparts, particularly in multi-turn settings, while maintaining superior consistency across multiple trials. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our verified blueprint-to-details approach yields high-quality training data, enabling the development of more reliable, efficient, and capable agents. We open-source 5K synthetic data trajectories and the trained xLAM-2-fc-r models to advance research in AI agents.

arXiv:2504.09459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to enhance interpretability by structuring predictions around human-understandable concepts. However, unintended information leakage, where predictive signals bypass the concept bottleneck, compromises their transparency. This paper introduces an information-theoretic measure to quantify leakage in CBMs, capturing the extent to which concept embeddings encode additional, unintended information beyond the specified concepts. We validate the measure through controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting leakage trends across various configurations. Our findings highlight that feature and concept dimensionality significantly influence leakage, and that classifier choice impacts measurement stability, with XGBoost emerging as the most reliable estimator. Additionally, preliminary investigations indicate that the measure exhibits the anticipated behavior when applied to soft joint CBMs, suggesting its reliability in leakage quantification beyond fully synthetic settings. While this study rigorously evaluates the measure in controlled synthetic experiments, future work can extend its application to real-world datasets.

<title>Executable Functional Abstractions: Inferring Generative Programs for Advanced Math Problems</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2504.09763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from reinforcement learning (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for mathematical reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to automatically constructing abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced mathematics problems by developing EFAGen, which operationalizes the task of automatically inferring an EFA for a given seed problem and solution as a program synthesis task. We first formalize the properties of any valid EFA as executable unit tests. Using execution feedback from the unit tests, we search over candidate programs sampled from a LLM to find EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. We then apply the tests as a reward signal, training LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We show that EFAs inferred by EFAGen are faithful to the seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show uses of model-written EFAs e.g., finding harder/easier problem variants, as well as data generation.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) deliver outstanding performance, but their complexity often prohibits deployment in resource-constrained settings. Comprehensive structured pruning frameworks based on parameter dependency analysis reduce model size with specific regard to computational performance. When applying them to Multi-Component Neural Architectures (MCNAs), they risk network integrity by removing large parameter groups. We introduce a component-aware pruning strategy, extending dependency graphs to isolate individual components and inter-component flows. This creates smaller, targeted pruning groups that conserve functional integrity. Demonstrated effectively on a control task, our approach achieves greater sparsity and reduced performance degradation, opening a path for optimizing complex, multi-component DNNs efficiently.

arXiv:2504.13682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal imaging can greatly enhance the application of intelligent unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in challenging environments. However, the inherent low resolution of thermal sensors leads to insufficient details and blurred boundaries. Super-resolution (SR) offers a promising solution to address this issue, while most existing SR methods are designed for fixed-scale SR. They are computationally expensive and inflexible in practical applications. To address above issues, this work proposes a novel any-scale thermal SR method (AnyTSR) for UAV within a single model. Specifically, a new image encoder is proposed to explicitly assign specific feature code to enable more accurate and flexible representation. Additionally, by effectively embedding coordinate offset information into the local feature ensemble, an innovative any-scale upsampler is proposed to better understand spatial relationships and reduce artifacts. Moreover, a novel dataset (UAV-TSR), covering both land and water scenes, is constructed for thermal SR tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scaling factors as well as generates more accurate and detailed high-resolution images. The code is located at https://github.com/vision4robotics/AnyTSR.

Abstract: When optimising for conditional value at risk (CVaR) using policy gradients (PG), current methods rely on discarding a large proportion of trajectories, resulting in poor sample efficiency. We propose a reformulation of the CVaR optimisation problem by capping the total return of trajectories used in training, rather than simply discarding them, and show that this is equivalent to the original problem if the cap is set appropriately. We show, with empirical results in an number of environments, that this reformulation of the problem results in consistently improved performance compared to baselines. We have made all our code available here: https://github.com/HarryMJMead/cvar-return-capping.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for heterogeneous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms to perform complex tasks in urban environments, system design now faces major challenges, including efficient semantic understanding, flexible task planning, and the ability to dynamically adjust coordination strategies in response to evolving environmental conditions and continuously changing task requirements. To address the limitations of existing methods, this paper proposes CoordField, a coordination field agent system for coordinating heterogeneous drone swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs) is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to dynamic changes.

<title>DualReal: Adaptive Joint Training for Lossless Identity-Motion Fusion in Video Customization</title>

arXiv:2505.02192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Customized text-to-video generation with pre-trained large-scale models has recently garnered significant attention by focusing on identity and motion consistency. Existing works typically follow the isolated customized paradigm, where the subject identity or motion dynamics are customized exclusively. However, this paradigm completely ignores the intrinsic mutual constraints and synergistic interdependencies between identity and motion, resulting in identity-motion conflicts throughout the generation process that systematically degrade. To address this, we introduce DualReal, a novel framework that employs adaptive joint training to construct interdependencies between dimensions collaboratively. Specifically, DualReal is composed of two units: (1) Dual-aware Adaptation dynamically switches the training step (i.e., identity or motion), learns the current information guided by the frozen dimension prior, and employs a regularization strategy to avoid knowledge leakage; (2) StageBlender Controller leverages the denoising stages and Diffusion Transformer depths to guide different dimensions with adaptive granularity, avoiding conflicts at various stages and ultimately achieving lossless fusion of identity and motion patterns. We constructed a more comprehensive evaluation benchmark than existing methods. The experimental results show that DualReal improves CLIP-I and DINO-I metrics by 21.7% and 31.8% on average, and achieves top performance on nearly all motion metrics.

Abstract: Modern automotive infotainment systems require intelligent and adaptive solutions to handle frequent User Interface (UI) updates and diverse design variations. We introduce a vision-language framework for understanding and interacting with automotive infotainment systems, enabling seamless adaptation across different UI designs. To further support research in this field, we release AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K, an open-source dataset of 998 images with 4,208 annotations. Additionally, we present a synthetic data pipeline to generate training data. We fine-tune a Molmo-7B-based model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa) and incorporating reasoning generated by our pipeline, along with visual grounding and evaluation capabilities. The fine-tuned Evaluative Large Action Model (ELAM) achieves strong performance on AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K (model and dataset are available on Hugging Face) and demonstrating strong cross-domain generalization, including a +5.6% improvement on ScreenSpot over the baseline model. Notably, our approach achieves 80.8% average accuracy on ScreenSpot, closely matching or even surpassing specialized models for desktop, mobile, and web, such as ShowUI, despite being trained for the infotainment domain. This research investigates how data collection and subsequent fine-tuning can lead to AI-driven progress within automotive UI understanding and interaction. The applied method is cost-efficient and fine-tuned models can be deployed on consumer-grade GPUs.

Abstract: While the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have progressed significantly, their use in high-stakes applications have been limited due to risks of hallucination. One key approach in reducing hallucination is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), but even in such setups, LLMs may still hallucinate when presented with questions outside of the knowledge base. Such behavior is unacceptable in high-stake applications where LLMs are expected to abstain from answering queries it does not have sufficient context on. In this work, we present a novel methodology for systematically evaluating out-of-knowledge base (OOKB) robustness of LLMs (whether LLMs know or do not know) in the RAG setting, without the need for manual annotation of gold standard answers. We implement our methodology in knowornot, an open-source library that enables users to develop their own customized evaluation data and pipelines for OOKB robustness. knowornot comprises four main features. Firstly, it provides a unified, high-level API that streamlines the process of setting up and running robustness benchmarks. Secondly, its modular architecture emphasizes extensibility and flexibility, allowing users to easily integrate their own LLM clients and RAG settings. Thirdly, its rigorous data modeling design ensures experiment reproducibility, reliability and traceability. Lastly, it implements a comprehensive suite of tools for users to customize their pipelines. We demonstrate the utility of knowornot by developing a challenging benchmark, PolicyBench, which spans four Question-Answer (QA) chatbots on government policies, and analyze its OOKB robustness.

Abstract: We consider a bandit optimization problem for nonconvex and non-smooth functions, where in each trial the loss function is the sum of a linear function and a small but arbitrary perturbation chosen after observing the player's choice. We give both expected and high probability regret bounds for the problem. Our result also implies an improved high-probability regret bound for the bandit linear optimization, a special case with no perturbation. We also give a lower bound on the expected regret.

Abstract: We present SemiOccam, an image recognition network that leverages semi-supervised learning in a highly efficient manner. Existing works often rely on complex training techniques and architectures, requiring hundreds of GPU hours for training, while their generalization ability with extremely limited labeled data remains to be improved. To address these limitations, we construct a hierarchical mixture density classification mechanism by optimizing mutual information between feature representations and target classes, compressing redundant information while retaining crucial discriminative components. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three commonly used datasets, with accuracy exceeding 95% on two of them using only 4 labeled samples per class, and its simple architecture keeps training time at the minute level. Notably, this paper reveals a long-overlooked data leakage issue in the STL-10 dataset for semi-supervised learning and removes duplicates to ensure reliable experimental results. We release the deduplicated CleanSTL-10 dataset to facilitate fair and reproducible research. Code available at https://github.com/Shu1L0n9/SemiOccam.

<title>Label-semantics Aware Generative Approach for Domain-Agnostic Multilabel Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06806</link>

Abstract: The explosion of textual data has made manual document classification increasingly challenging. To address this, we introduce a robust, efficient domain-agnostic generative model framework for multi-label text classification. Instead of treating labels as mere atomic symbols, our approach utilizes predefined label descriptions and is trained to generate these descriptions based on the input text. During inference, the generated descriptions are matched to the pre-defined labels using a finetuned sentence transformer. We integrate this with a dual-objective loss function, combining cross-entropy loss and cosine similarity of the generated sentences with the predefined target descriptions, ensuring both semantic alignment and accuracy. Our proposed model LAGAMC stands out for its parameter efficiency and versatility across diverse datasets, making it well-suited for practical applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model by achieving new state-of-the-art performances across all evaluated datasets, surpassing several strong baselines. We achieve improvements of 13.94% in Micro-F1 and 24.85% in Macro-F1 compared to the closest baseline across all datasets.

Abstract: Optimizing inference for long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly important due to the quadratic compute and linear memory complexity of Transformers. Existing approximation methods, such as key-value (KV) cache dropping, sparse attention, and prompt compression, typically rely on rough predictions of token or KV pair importance. We propose a novel framework for approximate LLM inference that leverages small draft models to more accurately predict the importance of tokens and KV pairs. Specifically, we introduce two instantiations of our proposed framework: (i) SpecKV, the first method that leverages a draft output to accurately assess the importance of each KV pair for more effective KV cache dropping, and (ii) SpecPC, which uses the draft model's attention activations to identify and discard unimportant prompt tokens. We motivate our methods with theoretical and empirical analyses, and show a strong correlation between the attention patterns of draft and target models. Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks show that our methods consistently achieve higher accuracy than existing baselines, while preserving the same improvements in memory usage, latency, and throughput. Our code is available at https://github.com/furiosa-ai/draft-based-approx-llm.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.10351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs indicate potential for novel applications, as evidenced by the reasoning capabilities in the latest OpenAI and DeepSeek models. To apply these models to domain-specific applications beyond text generation, LLM-based multi-agent systems can be utilized to solve complex tasks, particularly by combining reasoning techniques, code generation, and software execution across multiple, potentially specialized LLMs. However, while many evaluations are performed on LLMs, reasoning techniques, and applications individually, their joint specification and combined application are not well understood. Defined specifications for multi-agent LLM systems are required to explore their potential and suitability for specific applications, allowing for systematic evaluations of LLMs, reasoning techniques, and related aspects. This paper reports the results of exploratory research on (1.) multi-agent specification by introducing an agent schema language and (2.) the execution and evaluation of the specifications through a multi-agent system architecture and prototype. The specification language, system architecture, and prototype are first presented in this work, building on an LLM system from prior research. Test cases involving cybersecurity tasks indicate the feasibility of the architecture and evaluation approach. As a result, evaluations could be demonstrated for question answering, server security, and network security tasks completed correctly by agents with LLMs from OpenAI and DeepSeek.

<title>Dynamic Context Tuning for Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Enhancing Multi-Turn Planning and Tool Adaptation</title>

arXiv:2506.11092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced large language models (LLMs) by grounding their outputs in external tools and knowledge sources. However, existing RAG systems are typically constrained to static, single-turn interactions with fixed toolsets, making them ill-suited for dynamic domains such as healthcare and smart homes, where user intent, available tools, and contextual factors evolve over time. We present Dynamic Context Tuning (DCT), a lightweight framework that extends RAG to support multi-turn dialogue and evolving tool environments without requiring retraining. DCT integrates an attention-based context cache to track relevant past information, LoRA-based retrieval to dynamically select domain-specific tools, and efficient context compression to maintain inputs within LLM context limits. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that DCT improves plan accuracy by 14% and reduces hallucinations by 37%, while matching GPT-4 performance at significantly lower cost. Furthermore, DCT generalizes to previously unseen tools, enabling scalable and adaptable AI assistants across a wide range of dynamic environments.

arXiv:2506.11558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain, enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments, especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment, semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with LLM-generated temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision. Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.19037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) promise fast, non-autoregressive text generation, yet existing samplers, which pick tokens to unmask based on model confidence, ignore interactions when unmasking multiple positions in parallel and effectively reduce to slow, autoregressive behavior. We propose the Dilated Unmasking Scheduler (DUS), an inference-only, planner-model-free method that partitions sequence positions into non-adjacent dilated groups and unmasked them in parallel so as to minimize an upper bound on joint entropy gain at each denoising step. By explicitly trading off the number of network calls against generation quality, DUS recovers most of the performance lost under traditional parallel unmasking strategies. Across math (GSM8K, MATH500), code (HumanEval, MBPP) and general-knowledge benchmarks (BBH, MMLU-Pro), DUS outperforms confidence-based planners, without modifying the underlying denoiser, and reveals the true speed-quality frontier of MDLMs.

arXiv:2506.23516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) often suffers from performance degradation due to key challenges such as data heterogeneity and communication constraints. To address these limitations, we present a novel FL framework called FedWSQ, which integrates weight standardization (WS) and the proposed distribution-aware non-uniform quantization (DANUQ). WS enhances FL performance by filtering out biased components in local updates during training, thereby improving the robustness of the model against data heterogeneity and unstable client participation. In addition, DANUQ minimizes quantization errors by leveraging the statistical properties of local model updates. As a result, FedWSQ significantly reduces communication overhead while maintaining superior model accuracy. Extensive experiments on FL benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedWSQ consistently outperforms existing FL methods across various challenging FL settings, including extreme data heterogeneity and ultra-low-bit communication scenarios.

Abstract: Blind and low vision (BLV) individuals use Generative AI (GenAI) tools to interpret and manage visual content in their daily lives. While such tools can enhance the accessibility of visual content and so enable greater user independence, they also introduce complex challenges around visual privacy. In this paper, we investigate the current practices and future design preferences of blind and low vision individuals through an interview study with 21 participants. Our findings reveal a range of current practices with GenAI that balance privacy, efficiency, and emotional agency, with users accounting for privacy risks across six key scenarios, such as self-presentation, indoor/outdoor spatial privacy, social sharing, and handling professional content. Our findings reveal design preferences, including on-device processing, zero-retention guarantees, sensitive content redaction, privacy-aware appearance indicators, and multimodal tactile mirrored interaction methods. We conclude with actionable design recommendations to support user-centered visual privacy through GenAI, expanding the notion of privacy and responsible handling of others data.

arXiv:2507.00709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

<title>Frequency-Aligned Knowledge Distillation for Lightweight Spatiotemporal Forecasting</title>

arXiv:2507.02939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic flow, combustion dynamics, and weather forecasting, often require complex models that suffer from low training efficiency and high memory consumption. This paper proposes a lightweight framework, Spectral Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (termed SDKD), which transfers the multi-scale spatiotemporal representations from a complex teacher model to a more efficient lightweight student network. The teacher model follows an encoder-latent evolution-decoder architecture, where its latent evolution module decouples high-frequency details and low-frequency trends using convolution and Transformer (global low-frequency modeler). However, the multi-layer convolution and deconvolution structures result in slow training and high memory usage. To address these issues, we propose a frequency-aligned knowledge distillation strategy, which extracts multi-scale spectral features from the teacher's latent space, including both high and low frequency components, to guide the lightweight student model in capturing both local fine-grained variations and global evolution patterns. Experimental results show that SDKD significantly improves performance, achieving reductions of up to 81.3% in MSE and in MAE 52.3% on the Navier-Stokes equation dataset. The framework effectively captures both high-frequency variations and long-term trends while reducing computational complexity. Our codes are available at https://github.com/itsnotacie/SDKD

Abstract: The recent advancement of artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has significantly impacted software engineering research, including bug report analysis. ML aims to automate the understanding, extraction, and correlation of information from bug reports. Despite its growing importance, there has been no comprehensive review in this area. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review covering 1,825 papers, selecting 204 for detailed analysis. We derive seven key findings: 1) Extensive use of CNN, LSTM, and $k$NN for bug report analysis, with advanced models like BERT underutilized due to their complexity. 2) Word2Vec and TF-IDF are popular for feature representation, with a rise in deep learning approaches. 3) Stop word removal is the most common preprocessing, with structural methods rising after 2020. 4) Eclipse and Mozilla are the most frequently evaluated software projects. 5) Bug categorization is the most common task, followed by bug localization and severity prediction. 6) There is increasing attention on specific bugs like non-functional and performance bugs. 7) Common evaluation metrics are F1-score, Recall, Precision, and Accuracy, with $k$-fold cross-validation preferred for model evaluation. 8) Many studies lack robust statistical tests. We also identify six promising future research directions to provide useful insights for practitioners.

arXiv:2507.04790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning (IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions, sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Historical documents represent an invaluable cultural heritage, yet have undergone significant degradation over time through tears, water erosion, and oxidation. Existing Historical Document Restoration (HDR) methods primarily focus on single modality or limited-size restoration, failing to meet practical needs. To fill this gap, we present a full-page HDR dataset (FPHDR) and a novel automated HDR solution (AutoHDR). Specifically, FPHDR comprises 1,633 real and 6,543 synthetic images with character-level and line-level locations, as well as character annotations in different damage grades. AutoHDR mimics historians' restoration workflows through a three-stage approach: OCR-assisted damage localization, vision-language context text prediction, and patch autoregressive appearance restoration. The modular architecture of AutoHDR enables seamless human-machine collaboration, allowing for flexible intervention and optimization at each restoration stage. Experiments demonstrate AutoHDR's remarkable performance in HDR. When processing severely damaged documents, our method improves OCR accuracy from 46.83% to 84.05%, with further enhancement to 94.25% through human-machine collaboration. We believe this work represents a significant advancement in automated historical document restoration and contributes substantially to cultural heritage preservation. The model and dataset are available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/AutoHDR.

Abstract: Realistic, high-fidelity 3D facial animations are crucial for expressive avatar systems in human-computer interaction and accessibility. Although prior methods show promising quality, their reliance on the mesh domain limits their ability to fully leverage the rapid visual innovations seen in 2D computer vision and graphics. We propose VisualSpeaker, a novel method that bridges this gap using photorealistic differentiable rendering, supervised by visual speech recognition, for improved 3D facial animation. Our contribution is a perceptual lip-reading loss, derived by passing photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting avatar renders through a pre-trained Visual Automatic Speech Recognition model during training. Evaluation on the MEAD dataset demonstrates that VisualSpeaker improves both the standard Lip Vertex Error metric by 56.1% and the perceptual quality of the generated animations, while retaining the controllability of mesh-driven animation. This perceptual focus naturally supports accurate mouthings, essential cues that disambiguate similar manual signs in sign language avatars.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables multiple tasks to be learned within a shared network, but differences in objectives across tasks can cause negative transfer, where the learning of one task degrades another task's performance. While pre-trained transformers significantly improve MTL performance, their fixed network capacity and rigid structure limit adaptability. Previous dynamic network architectures attempt to address this but are inefficient as they directly convert shared parameters into task-specific ones. We propose Dynamic Token Modulation and Expansion (DTME-MTL), a framework applicable to any transformer-based MTL architecture. DTME-MTL enhances adaptability and reduces overfitting by identifying gradient conflicts in token space and applying adaptive solutions based on conflict type. Unlike prior methods that mitigate negative transfer by duplicating network parameters, DTME-MTL operates entirely in token space, enabling efficient adaptation without excessive parameter growth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTME-MTL consistently improves multi-task performance with minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable and effective solution for enhancing transformer-based MTL models.

arXiv:2507.07778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing neural networks to unseen target domains is a significant challenge in real-world deployments. Test-time training (TTT) addresses this by using an auxiliary self-supervised task to reduce the domain gap caused by distribution shifts between the source and target. However, we find that when models are required to perform multiple tasks under domain shifts, conventional TTT methods suffer from unsynchronized task behavior, where the adaptation steps needed for optimal performance in one task may not align with the requirements of other tasks. To address this, we propose a novel TTT approach called Synchronizing Tasks for Test-time Training (S4T), which enables the concurrent handling of multiple tasks. The core idea behind S4T is that predicting task relations across domain shifts is key to synchronizing tasks during test time. To validate our approach, we apply S4T to conventional multi-task benchmarks, integrating it with traditional TTT protocols. Our empirical results show that S4T outperforms state-of-the-art TTT methods across various benchmarks.

<div> Framework, ethics requirements, multi-agent LLM, system description, human feedback

Summary:
The study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. It aims to address the challenges of eliciting manual ethics requirements, such as time and resource constraints. The framework was evaluated through two case studies, demonstrating its ability to capture a significant number of ethics requirements and introduce relevant additional ones. However, it also identified reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the importance of human feedback in this sensitive domain. Overall, the framework offers a promising approach to incorporating ethics into the requirements engineering process and creating ethically aligned systems.

Abstract: Incorporating ethics into the requirement elicitation process is essential for creating ethically aligned systems. Although eliciting manual ethics requirements is effective, it requires diverse input from multiple stakeholders, which can be challenging due to time and resource constraints. Moreover, it is often given a low priority in the requirements elicitation process. This study proposes a framework for generating ethics requirements drafts by introducing an ethics advocate agent in a multi-agent LLM setting. This agent critiques and provides input on ethical issues based on the system description. The proposed framework is evaluated through two case studies from different contexts, demonstrating that it captures the majority of ethics requirements identified by researchers during 30-minute interviews and introduces several additional relevant requirements. However, it also highlights reliability issues in generating ethics requirements, emphasizing the need for human feedback in this sensitive domain. We believe this work can facilitate the broader adoption of ethics in the requirements engineering process, ultimately leading to more ethically aligned products.

<div> personalized feedback, curriculum-aligned, science education, error-aware assessment, modular system

Summary:
LearnLens is a modular system based on Language Model (LLM) technology designed to provide personalized feedback in science education. The system consists of three components: an error-aware assessment module that identifies nuanced reasoning errors, a curriculum-grounded generation module that utilizes a structured memory chain for feedback generation, and an educator-in-the-loop interface for customization and oversight. By using a topic-linked memory chain instead of traditional similarity-based retrieval, LearnLens delivers more relevant feedback while reducing unnecessary noise. This approach addresses the challenges faced by existing feedback systems, offering scalable and high-quality feedback that benefits both teachers and students. With LearnLens, educators can efficiently provide effective feedback that enhances student learning in a curriculum-aligned manner. <div>

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in end-to-end AI music generation, AI-driven modeling of professional Digital Signal Processing (DSP) workflows remains challenging. In particular, while there is growing interest in neural black-box modeling of audio effect graphs (e.g. reverb, compression, equalization), AI-based approaches struggle to replicate the nuanced signal flow and parameter interactions used in professional workflows. Existing differentiable plugin approaches often diverge from real-world tools, exhibiting inferior performance relative to simplified neural controllers under equivalent computational constraints. We introduce WildFX, a pipeline containerized with Docker for generating multi-track audio mixing datasets with rich effect graphs, powered by a professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) backend. WildFX supports seamless integration of cross-platform commercial plugins or any plugins in the wild, in VST/VST3/LV2/CLAP formats, enabling structural complexity (e.g., sidechains, crossovers) and achieving efficient parallelized processing. A minimalist metadata interface simplifies project/plugin configuration. Experiments demonstrate the pipeline's validity through blind estimation of mixing graphs, plugin/gain parameters, and its ability to bridge AI research with practical DSP demands. The code is available on: https://github.com/IsaacYQH/WildFX.

<div> GraphTrafficGPT, Large Language Models, traffic management, graph-based architecture, task coordination <br />
<br />
GraphTrafficGPT is proposed as an improved architecture for Large Language Models (LLMs) in traffic management. It utilizes a graph-based approach to represent tasks and dependencies, enabling parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The model includes a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for various tasks. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2%, average response latency by 19.0%, and improves efficiency by 23.0% for multi-query execution compared to TrafficGPT. These enhancements make GraphTrafficGPT more efficient for complex, real-world scenarios in urban mobility environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant promise for intelligent traffic management; however, current chain-based systems like TrafficGPT are hindered by sequential task execution, high token usage, and poor scalability, making them inefficient for complex, real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose GraphTrafficGPT, a novel graph-based architecture, which fundamentally redesigns the task coordination process for LLM-driven traffic applications. GraphTrafficGPT represents tasks and their dependencies as nodes and edges in a directed graph, enabling efficient parallel execution and dynamic resource allocation. The main idea behind the proposed model is a Brain Agent that decomposes user queries, constructs optimized dependency graphs, and coordinates a network of specialized agents for data retrieval, analysis, visualization, and simulation. By introducing advanced context-aware token management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed architecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility environments. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphTrafficGPT reduces token consumption by 50.2% and average response latency by 19.0% compared to TrafficGPT, while supporting simultaneous multi-query execution with up to 23.0% improvement in efficiency.

<div> community values, preference modeling, attribute dimensions, human judgment, social communities 

Summary: 
PrefPalette introduces a framework for personalizing AI systems by understanding the underlying reasons for user preferences. It decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its prediction to distinct social community values. The approach uses a multi-attribute decision-making principle, involving a counterfactual attribute synthesis step and attention-based preference modeling. It moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture diverse evaluation frameworks driving human judgment. Evaluated on 45 Reddit communities, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by 46.6% in prediction accuracy. The model reveals community-specific profiles: scholarly communities focus on verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities emphasize empathy. PrefPalette not only provides superior preference modeling but also offers transparent and interpretable insights into human judgment, aiming to create more trustworthy and value-aware personalized applications.

Abstract: Personalizing AI systems requires understanding not just what users prefer, but the reasons that underlie those preferences - yet current preference models typically treat human judgment as a black box. We introduce PrefPalette, a framework that decomposes preferences into attribute dimensions and tailors its preference prediction to distinct social community values in a human-interpretable manner. PrefPalette operationalizes a cognitive science principle known as multi-attribute decision making in two ways: (1) a scalable counterfactual attribute synthesis step that involves generating synthetic training data to isolate for individual attribute effects (e.g., formality, humor, cultural values), and (2) attention-based preference modeling that learns how different social communities dynamically weight these attributes. This approach moves beyond aggregate preference modeling to capture the diverse evaluation frameworks that drive human judgment. When evaluated on 45 social communities from the online platform Reddit, PrefPalette outperforms GPT-4o by 46.6% in average prediction accuracy. Beyond raw predictive improvements, PrefPalette also shed light on intuitive, community-specific profiles: scholarly communities prioritize verbosity and stimulation, conflict-oriented communities value sarcasm and directness, and support-based communities emphasize empathy. By modeling the attribute-mediated structure of human judgment, PrefPalette delivers both superior preference modeling and transparent, interpretable insights, and serves as a first step toward more trustworthy, value-aware personalized applications.

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet, those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts. This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications in sensitive domains.

<title>Why Isn't Relational Learning Taking Over the World?</title>

<div> keywords: AI, entities, relational learning, statistical relational AI, data <br />
Summary: Relational learning, a field focusing on modeling entities and their relationships, is not as prevalent as pixel and word-based AI systems. Despite valuable data existing in relational formats like spreadsheets and databases, the prominence of relational learning remains limited. The paper highlights the importance of shifting focus towards modeling entities and their properties, emphasizing the need to incorporate relational learning into mainstream AI practices. Its rightful prominence can be achieved through addressing the challenges and limitations that currently hinder its widespread adoption. <div>
arXiv:2507.13558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI seems to be taking over the world with systems that model pixels, words, and phonemes. The world is arguably made up, not of pixels, words, and phonemes but of entities (objects, things, including events) with properties and relations among them. Surely we should model these, not the perception or description of them. You might suspect that concentrating on modeling words and pixels is because all of the (valuable) data in the world is in terms of text and images. If you look into almost any company you will find their most valuable data is in spreadsheets, databases and other relational formats. These are not the form that are studied in introductory machine learning, but are full of product numbers, student numbers, transaction numbers and other identifiers that can't be interpreted naively as numbers. The field that studies this sort of data has various names including relational learning, statistical relational AI, and many others. This paper explains why relational learning is not taking over the world -- except in a few cases with restricted relations -- and what needs to be done to bring it to it's rightful prominence.

Summary:
BifrostRAG is introduced as a dual-graph RAG-integrated system for information retrieval and question answering in safety regulations. It addresses the complexity of regulatory text by modeling linguistic relationships and document structure through two graphs. The system combines graph traversal with semantic search, enabling large language models to reason over text meaning and structure. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset demonstrates BifrostRAG's precision of 92.8%, recall of 85.5%, and F1 score of 87.3%, outperforming current approaches. Error analysis showcases the advantages of the hybrid method over vector-only and graph-only systems. BifrostRAG is established as a robust knowledge engine for compliance checking driven by large language models. Its dual-graph, hybrid retrieval mechanism offers a blueprint for navigating complex technical documents in knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

arXiv:2507.13625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval and question answering from safety regulations are essential for automated construction compliance checking but are hindered by the linguistic and structural complexity of regulatory text. Many compliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information across interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce BifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both linguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure (via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval mechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search, enabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the structure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that BifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1 score of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and graph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error analysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method over single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust knowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid retrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex technical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.

<div> intelligent tutoring systems, error diagnosis, final answer, automated diagnosis, quadratic equations  
Summary:  
- Many intelligent tutoring systems support students in stepwise tasks, but diagnosing errors when steps are combined can be challenging due to combinatorial explosion.  
- Using a final answer for diagnosis can help reduce the complexity, as there are fewer possible erroneous final answers compared to solution paths.  
- This study explores automated error diagnosis based on final answers, aiming to provide buggy rule diagnosis when students combine steps.  
- Applying this approach to a dataset of student steps in solving quadratic equations showed a 29.4% success rate in diagnosing previously undiagnosed steps.  
- Comparing generated diagnoses with teacher diagnoses on a subset of cases revealed a 97% alignment, indicating the potential effectiveness of the final answer evaluation approach.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many intelligent tutoring systems can support a student in solving a stepwise task. When a student combines several steps in one step, the number of possible paths connecting consecutive inputs may be very large. This combinatorial explosion makes error diagnosis hard. Using a final answer to diagnose a combination of steps can mitigate the combinatorial explosion, because there are generally fewer possible (erroneous) final answers than (erroneous) solution paths. An intermediate input for a task can be diagnosed by automatically completing it according to the task solution strategy and diagnosing this solution. This study explores the potential of automated error diagnosis based on a final answer. We investigate the design of a service that provides a buggy rule diagnosis when a student combines several steps. To validate the approach, we apply the service to an existing dataset (n=1939) of unique student steps when solving quadratic equations, which could not be diagnosed by a buggy rule service that tries to connect consecutive inputs with a single rule. Results show that final answer evaluation can diagnose 29,4% of these steps. Moreover, a comparison of the generated diagnoses with teacher diagnoses on a subset (n=115) shows that the diagnoses align in 97% of the cases. These results can be considered a basis for further exploration of the approach.

Summary:
This study introduces an approach that combines model tracing and constraint-based modeling for diagnosing student input in stepwise tasks. By defining constraints as properties shared between student input and a strategy step, the system can provide diagnoses even when students deviate from a strategy or combine multiple steps. The system design for multistep strategy diagnoses is explored, and evaluations are conducted using a dataset of students solving quadratic equations. Results show that the system's diagnoses align with human coding, with 100% agreement on 140 student steps. This approach offers a comprehensive method for diagnosing student input in educational settings, enhancing the understanding of student problem-solving processes. <div>
arXiv:2507.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model tracing and constraint-based modeling are two approaches to diagnose student input in stepwise tasks. Model tracing supports identifying consecutive problem-solving steps taken by a student, whereas constraint-based modeling supports student input diagnosis even when several steps are combined into one step. We propose an approach that merges both paradigms. By defining constraints as properties that a student input has in common with a step of a strategy, it is possible to provide a diagnosis when a student deviates from a strategy even when the student combines several steps. In this study we explore the design of a system for multistep strategy diagnoses, and evaluate these diagnoses. As a proof of concept, we generate diagnoses for an existing dataset containing steps students take when solving quadratic equations (n=2136). To compare with human diagnoses, two teachers coded a random sample of deviations (n=70) and applications of the strategy (n=70). Results show that that the system diagnosis aligned with the teacher coding in all of the 140 student steps.

The article introduces DailyLLM, a novel system for generating and summarizing activity logs that integrates contextual information from location, motion, environment, and physiology dimensions. It utilizes sensors commonly found in smartphones and smartwatches to achieve high-level activity understanding. DailyLLM employs a lightweight framework that combines structured prompting and efficient feature extraction to improve accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness in log generation. Experimental results show that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 17% improvement in log generation precision compared to baseline models with 70B parameters. Additionally, DailyLLM demonstrates nearly 10 times faster inference speed, making it suitable for deployment on personal computers and Raspberry Pi platforms. <div>

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing. The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion, environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference speed.

Summary:
OntView is a new ontology viewer that aims to address the challenge of effectively visualizing ontology structures. It provides users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Utilizing a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" approach, displaying actual inferred knowledge. One key feature is its ability to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a function lacking in existing tools. To prevent overwhelming users with information, OntView offers methods to simplify views, such as creating ontology summaries based on concept importance, focusing on TBox elements between specific classes, and dynamically hiding/showing branches without losing semantics. The tool has been released with an open-source license, benefiting the entire community.

arXiv:2507.13759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users' ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm, showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload, OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts (according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics. OntView has been released with an open-source license for the whole community.

Summary: 
EAGLE is introduced as a lightweight framework for temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs. It integrates short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns through a time-aware module and structure-aware module respectively. EAGLE utilizes an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance these attributes dynamically. Unlike existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, resulting in significant improvements in efficiency. Experimental results on real-world temporal graphs show that EAGLE outperforms state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a speedup of over 50x compared to effective transformer-based T-GNNs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a critical task with applications in diverse domains such as social networks, recommendation systems, and e-commerce platforms. While existing Temporal Graph Neural Networks (T-GNNs) have achieved notable success by leveraging complex architectures to model temporal and structural dependencies, they often suffer from scalability and efficiency challenges due to high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose EAGLE, a lightweight framework that integrates short-term temporal recency and long-term global structural patterns. EAGLE consists of a time-aware module that aggregates information from a node's most recent neighbors to reflect its immediate preferences, and a structure-aware module that leverages temporal personalized PageRank to capture the influence of globally important nodes. To balance these attributes, EAGLE employs an adaptive weighting mechanism to dynamically adjust their contributions based on data characteristics. Also, EAGLE eliminates the need for complex multi-hop message passing or memory-intensive mechanisms, enabling significant improvements in efficiency. Extensive experiments on seven real-world temporal graphs demonstrate that EAGLE consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art T-GNNs in both effectiveness and efficiency, delivering more than a 50x speedup over effective transformer-based T-GNNs.

The paper introduces a causal knowledge transfer framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning in non-stationary environments. Traditional methods struggle to transfer knowledge efficiently, often requiring costly retraining. The framework enables agents to share compact causal representations of paths, allowing for adaptive recovery strategies in response to changing obstacles. Each collision is modeled as a causal intervention, represented by a sequence of recovery actions transferred online from another agent. Results show that agents with different goals were able to bridge the gap between random exploration and fully retrained policies when adapting to new environments. The impact of causal knowledge transfer depends on the complexity of the environment and the diversity of agents' goals. <div>

Abstract: [Context] Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved notable success in environments where agents must learn coordinated behaviors. However, transferring knowledge across agents remains challenging in non-stationary environments with changing goals. [Problem] Traditional knowledge transfer methods in MARL struggle to generalize, and agents often require costly retraining to adapt. [Approach] This paper introduces a causal knowledge transfer framework that enables RL agents to learn and share compact causal representations of paths within a non-stationary environment. As the environment changes (new obstacles), agents' collisions require adaptive recovery strategies. We model each collision as a causal intervention instantiated as a sequence of recovery actions (a macro) whose effect corresponds to a causal knowledge of how to circumvent the obstacle while increasing the chances of achieving the agent's goal (maximizing cumulative reward). This recovery action macro is transferred online from a second agent and is applied in a zero-shot fashion, i.e., without retraining, just by querying a lookup model with local context information (collisions). [Results] Our findings reveal two key insights: (1) agents with heterogeneous goals were able to bridge about half of the gap between random exploration and a fully retrained policy when adapting to new environments, and (2) the impact of causal knowledge transfer depends on the interplay between environment complexity and agents' heterogeneous goals.

<div> latent-space, ideation framework, creativity, LLMs, AI

Summary:
The paper discusses the challenge of generating innovative ideas using large language models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence. LLMs often struggle to produce novel and relevant outputs as they tend to replicate patterns from their training data. Existing solutions rely on domain-specific rules and structured prompts, which are not easily adaptable. The proposed model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework offers a scalable and controlled approach to creativity by navigating the continuous idea embedding space. Unlike previous methods, this framework requires no handcrafted rules and can be easily adapted to various domains, input formats, and creative tasks. The paper presents a prototype of the framework and initial results that showcase its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language models (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and relevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during training, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt engineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics and structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and difficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic latent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by navigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our framework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains, input formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage prototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary results highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI collaboration.

<div> Keywords: Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimer's Disease, Cross-modal Causal Intervention, Diagnosis, Multi-modal Learning <br />

Summary: 
The study presents a novel framework called ADPC for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease by integrating visual and language data. Mild Cognitive Impairment is identified as a precursor to AD, making early detection crucial. The framework utilizes a large language model to summarize clinical data and distinguish between Cognitively Normal, MCI, and AD cases using MRI and fMRI images. By addressing confounders through causal intervention, the model achieves superior performance in classification tasks. The study highlights the importance of causal reasoning in multi-modal learning for improving neurological disease diagnosis. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets. The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI) images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers, non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations, generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic systems with a fine-grained temporal and numeric resolution presents significant challenges for logic-based approaches like Answer Set Programming (ASP). To address this, we introduce and elaborate upon a novel temporal and constraint-based extension of the logic of Here-and-There and its nonmonotonic equilibrium extension, representing, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to nonmonotonic temporal reasoning with constraints specifically tailored for ASP. This expressive system is achieved by a synergistic combination of two foundational ASP extensions: the linear-time logic of Here-and-There, providing robust nonmonotonic temporal reasoning capabilities, and the logic of Here-and-There with constraints, enabling the direct integration and manipulation of numeric constraints, among others. This work establishes the foundational logical framework for tackling complex dynamic systems with high resolution within the ASP paradigm.

Summary: 
KROMA is a novel Ontology Matching framework that utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enhance semantic context with various types of knowledge. It incorporates bisimilarity-based concept matching and ontology refinement to improve performance and reduce communication overhead. By combining knowledge retrieval with context-boosted LLMs, KROMA surpasses traditional OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches in experiments on multiple datasets. The optimization techniques used in KROMA, including targeted knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement, demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing ontology matching at scale while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability, yet existing systems often rely on handcrafted rules or specialized models with limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching, outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology matching at scale.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are a critical part of state-of-the-art digital health technology for diabetes management. Yet, access to large high-quality datasets is creating barriers that impede development of robust AI solutions. To accelerate development of transparent, reproducible, and robust AI solutions, we present Glucose-ML, a collection of 10 publicly available diabetes datasets, released within the last 7 years (i.e., 2018 - 2025). The Glucose-ML collection comprises over 300,000 days of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data with a total of 38 million glucose samples collected from 2500+ people across 4 countries. Participants include persons living with type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and no diabetes. To support researchers and innovators with using this rich collection of diabetes datasets, we present a comparative analysis to guide algorithm developers with data selection. Additionally, we conduct a case study for the task of blood glucose prediction - one of the most common AI tasks within the field. Through this case study, we provide a benchmark for short-term blood glucose prediction across all 10 publicly available diabetes datasets within the Glucose-ML collection. We show that the same algorithm can have significantly different prediction results when developed/evaluated with different datasets. Findings from this study are then used to inform recommendations for developing robust AI solutions within the diabetes or broader health domain. We provide direct links to each longitudinal diabetes dataset in the Glucose-ML collection and openly provide our code.

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks. G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

Abstract: Bridge maintenance and safety are essential for transportation authorities, and Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE) techniques are critical to assessing structural integrity. However, interpreting NDE data can be time-consuming and requires expertise, potentially delaying decision-making. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new ways to automate and improve this analysis. This pilot study introduces a holistic assessment of LLM capabilities for interpreting NDE contour maps and demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in providing detailed bridge condition analyses. It establishes a framework for integrating LLMs into bridge inspection workflows, indicating that LLM-assisted analysis can enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. In this study, several LLMs are explored with prompts specifically designed to enhance the quality of image descriptions, which are applied to interpret five different NDE contour maps obtained through technologies for assessing bridge conditions. Each LLM model is evaluated based on its ability to produce detailed descriptions, identify defects, provide actionable recommendations, and demonstrate overall accuracy. The research indicates that four of the nine models provide better image descriptions, effectively covering a wide range of topics related to the bridge's condition. The outputs from these four models are summarized using five different LLMs to form a comprehensive overview of the bridge. Notably, LLMs ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet generate more effective summaries. The findings suggest that LLMs have the potential to significantly improve efficiency and accuracy. This pilot study presents an innovative approach that leverages LLMs for image captioning in parallel and summarization, enabling faster decision-making in bridge maintenance and enhancing infrastructure management and safety assessments.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization to address the increasing demand for GPU resources driven by Large Language Models. Despite previous models showing limited success in improving CUDA speed, CUDA-L1 delivers significant performance improvements, achieving an average speedup of x17.7 on NVIDIA A100 across 250 CUDA kernels. The model exhibits portability across different GPU architectures, showing average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, and more. Additionally, CUDA-L1 displays the ability to discover and strategically combine various CUDA optimization techniques, uncover fundamental principles, and identify performance bottlenecks. The trained RL model can autonomously optimize CUDA operations without human expertise, offering great potential to enhance GPU efficiency and alleviate resource pressure. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.14111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth in demand for GPU computing resources, driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models, has created an urgent need for automated CUDA optimization strategies. While recent advances in LLMs show promise for code generation, current SOTA models (e.g. R1, o1) achieve low success rates in improving CUDA speed. In this paper, we introduce CUDA-L1, an automated reinforcement learning framework for CUDA optimization.
  CUDA-L1 achieves performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x17.7 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x449. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates excellent portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x17.8 on H100, x19.0 on RTX 3090, x16.5 on L40, x14.7 on H800, and x13.9 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. Beyond these benchmark results, CUDA-L1 demonstrates several remarkable properties: 1) Discovers a variety of CUDA optimization techniques and learns to combine them strategically to achieve optimal performance; 2) Uncovers fundamental principles of CUDA optimization; 3) Identifies non-obvious performance bottlenecks and rejects seemingly beneficial optimizations that harm performance.
  The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that reinforcement learning can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. More importantly, the trained RL model extend the acquired reasoning abilities to new kernels. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources.

The paper explores the possibility that by processing and synthesizing large amounts of ethical contexts, AI systems may discover moral meta-patterns that transcend cultural, historical, and individual biases, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of universal ethical foundations. The paper also examines a paradoxical aspect of the hypothesis, in which AI systems could potentially deepen our understanding of what we traditionally consider essentially human - our capacity for ethical reflection.

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning (VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only 1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models, coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017}) marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture for large language models.

Abstract: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven electronic design and automation (EDA) tools, high-performance computing, and parallelized algorithms are essential for next-generation microprocessor innovation, ensuring continued progress in computing, AI, and semiconductor technology. Machine learning-based design rule checking (DRC) and lithography hotspot detection can improve first-pass silicon success. However, conventional ML and neural network (NN)-based models use supervised learning and require a large balanced dataset (in terms of positive and negative classes) and training time. This research addresses those key challenges by proposing the first-ever unsupervised DRC violation prediction methodology. The proposed model can be built using any unbalanced dataset using only one class and set a threshold for it, then fitting any new data querying if they are within the boundary of the model for classification. This research verified the proposed model by implementing different computational cores using CMOS 28 nm technology and Synopsys Design Compiler and IC Compiler II tools. Then, layouts were divided into virtual grids to collect about 60k data for analysis and verification. The proposed method has 99.95% prediction test accuracy, while the existing support vector machine (SVM) and neural network (NN) models have 85.44\% and 98.74\% accuracy, respectively. In addition, the proposed methodology has about 26.3x and up to 6003x lower training times compared to SVM and NN-models, respectively.

Summary:<br />
Visual Language Models (VLMs) are successful in complex visual tasks like VQA but struggle with basic perceptual tests. This study evaluates VLMs' ability for nonlocal visual reasoning, including comparative perception, saccadic search, and smooth visual search. Flagship models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-o4-mini fail these tests, showing low accuracy compared to human performance on tasks that are easy for humans. Despite improvements in visual acuity, current models lack essential visual reasoning abilities required for solving nonlocal visual tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.13361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models' capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

<br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the spatial reasoning abilities of vision-language models (VLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning. The research evaluates different prompting strategies and finds that simple CoT formats do not improve performance, while structured multi-stage prompting based on scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) enhances spatial reasoning accuracy significantly. Fine-tuning models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset leads to higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), showing better robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. SFT may overfit to linguistic patterns, causing degraded performance with test-time phrasing changes, but GRPO generalizes reliably and maintains stable performance under such shifts. The study offers valuable insights on how reinforcement learning and structured prompting can enhance spatial reasoning capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. <div>

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning (SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular, we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open source at: https://github.com/Yvonne511/spatial-vlm-investigator

<div> Keywords: 3D object detection, vision-language models, open-world settings, geometric inflation, Pseudo-nuScenes

Summary: 
This work presents a novel approach to 3D object detection using 2D vision-language models trained on web-scale image-text pairs. By leveraging the semantic understanding of these models, the pipeline generates text-conditioned proposals for 3D object detection without the need for human-annotated 3D labels. The method utilizes camera geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth for 3D projection of proposals and introduces a geometric inflation strategy for inferring 3D bounding boxes without training. Additionally, a fog-augmented, RGB-only dataset called Pseudo-nuScenes is created to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results show competitive localization performance with LiDAR-based and RGB-D inputs, emphasizing the scalability and open-vocabulary nature of the approach. The code and resources are open-sourced for further research and development.

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D perception. We open-source our code and resources at https://github.com/atharv0goel/open-world-3D-det.

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12 different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining strategy and adapted multitask training.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a novel method called CMV-ND for deep graph clustering (DGC) to address the challenges of large-scale and attribute-missing attribute graphs. CMV-ND preprocesses graph structural information into multiple views using a recursive neighborhood search and a neighborhood differential strategy to ensure completeness and non-redundancy. This approach constructs complementary views from differential hop representations and node features, which are then used in existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods. Experimental results on various graph datasets show that CMV-ND significantly enhances the performance of different methods in graph clustering tasks. <div>

Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation. However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions, are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary \underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew \underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation (\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining popularity for hardware design automation, particularly through Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. In this work, we examine the current literature on RTL generation using LLMs and identify key requirements for training and fine-tuning datasets. We construct a robust Verilog dataset through an automated three-pronged process involving database (DB) creation and management with PostgreSQL, data collection from code hosting sites like OpenCores and GitHub, and data preprocessing to verify the codes' syntax, run logic synthesis, and extract relevant module metadata. We implement a scalable and efficient DB infrastructure to support analysis and detail our preprocessing pipeline to enforce high-quality data before DB insertion. The resulting dataset comprises 20,392 Verilog samples, 751 MB of Verilog code data, which is the largest high-quality Verilog dataset for LLM fine-tuning to our knowledge. We further evaluate the dataset, address associated challenges, and explore potential applications for future research and development in LLM-based hardware generation.

Summary: 
The article introduces the H-NeiFi framework, a hierarchical and non-intrusive approach to guiding opinions on social media platforms towards global consensus. By considering social roles and behavioral characteristics of users, the framework aims to optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Unlike existing methods that directly modify user views or enforce connections, H-NeiFi prioritizes user autonomy and avoids intrusive interventions. Experimental results demonstrate that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed and maintains global convergence, even in the absence of experts. This approach offers a natural and efficient way to guide opinion evolution on social networks while preventing divisions at the macro level, providing a new paradigm for social network governance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.

Traditional dense text captions are effective but expensive, missing critical visual information. ModaRoute uses GPT-4.1 to analyze query intent, predicting information needs to reduce computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. By routing queries across ASR, OCR, and visual indices, the system averages 1.78 modalities per query, outperforming the exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips shows that intelligent routing is a practical solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems, reducing costs while maintaining competitive effectiveness in real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR (speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Summary: 
PersonaGen introduces a framework for generating emotionally rich text by using a Large Language Model (LLM) with multi-stage persona-based conditioning. It creates virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural backgrounds, and situational contexts to guide emotion expression generation. The generated synthetic data shows higher semantic diversity, human-likeness, realism, and practical utility compared to baseline methods. This approach demonstrates potential for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional datasets in emotion recognition tasks. <div>
arXiv:2507.13380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model (LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse, coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional datasets.

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication, capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain, revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies, LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives. This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be harmful.

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Babel, a framework for enhancing stylistic fidelity in neural machine translation (NMT) without the need for parallel corpora. Babel consists of a style detector that identifies stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and a diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies these inconsistencies while maintaining semantic integrity. The framework can be integrated into existing NMT systems as a post-processing module, without requiring extensive modifications or parallel stylistic data. Experimental results across five diverse domains show that Babel effectively identifies stylistic inconsistencies and improves stylistic preservation by 150%, while maintaining a high semantic similarity score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel better preserve the source text style while ensuring fluency and adequacy.

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing, medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

Summary:
This paper introduces IConMark, a novel semantic watermarking technique for distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. Unlike traditional methods, IConMark embeds interpretable concepts into images, making it resilient to adversarial attacks. The method is both robust against image augmentations and human-readable, allowing for manual verification of watermarks. IConMark outperforms existing techniques in terms of detection accuracy and image quality preservation. Additionally, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with StegaStamp and TrustMark further enhance robustness against various image manipulations. Experimental results demonstrate that IConMark and its variants achieve significantly higher AUROC scores for watermark detection compared to baseline methods on multiple datasets. <div>

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness, demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique (IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9% higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on various datasets.

<div> Shoulder fractures; AI system; deep learning; ensemble techniques; clinical relevance<br />
<br />
Summary: 
An AI system was developed using deep learning models to detect shoulder fractures in X-rays. The system, trained on 10,000 annotated images, utilized architectures such as Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet, and RF-DETR. By applying ensemble techniques like Soft-NMS and WBF, the system achieved high accuracy (95.5%) and F1-score (0.9610), outperforming individual models. The model demonstrated strong recall and localization precision, indicating its effectiveness in clinical fracture detection. The results suggest that ensemble-based AI can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs, making it suitable for integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. However, the current model is limited to binary fracture detection for rapid screening and triage support, rather than detailed orthopedic classification. <div>

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays. Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

<div> Sparse autoencoder, language steering, multilingual language models, controllable generation, interpretable behaviors

Summary: In this work, the researchers explore the use of sparse autoencoder (SAE) features to control the language generation of large multilingual language models (LLMs) without explicit prompts or fine-tuning. They leverage pretrained SAEs on residual streams of Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B models to identify features that distinguish between English and four target languages. By modifying a single SAE feature at a transformer layer, they achieve successful language shifts with high accuracy while maintaining semantic fidelity. The study shows that language steering is most effective in mid-to-late transformer layers and is influenced by specific attention heads. These findings highlight the potential of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and interpretable method for controlled multilingual language generation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding) similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable, domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM answers.

Summary: 
The study introduces the SEER Network for multimodal fake news detection, focusing on semantic enhancement and emotional reasoning to improve accuracy. The network generates summarized captions for image understanding and leverages large multimodal models for semantic enhancement. An expert emotional reasoning module simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer news authenticity. Previous studies have shown that fake news often contains negative emotions, making emotional reasoning a crucial aspect of detection. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of SEER over existing methods. This approach addresses the limitations of previous studies by incorporating semantic and emotional features, leading to more effective detection of fake news. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies on multimodal fake news detection mainly focus on the alignment and integration of cross-modal features, as well as the application of text-image consistency. However, they overlook the semantic enhancement effects of large multimodal models and pay little attention to the emotional features of news. In addition, people find that fake news is more inclined to contain negative emotions than real ones. Therefore, we propose a novel Semantic Enhancement and Emotional Reasoning (SEER) Network for multimodal fake news detection. We generate summarized captions for image semantic understanding and utilize the products of large multimodal models for semantic enhancement. Inspired by the perceived relationship between news authenticity and emotional tendencies, we propose an expert emotional reasoning module that simulates real-life scenarios to optimize emotional features and infer the authenticity of news. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our SEER over state-of-the-art baselines.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new methodology for data-driven learning that takes into account history-dependent multi-fidelity data while distinguishing between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. The approach is hierarchical and adaptable to various learning scenarios, ranging from basic single-fidelity deterministic neural networks to more complex multi-fidelity variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The methodology is demonstrated in different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios, accurately predicting responses, quantifying model errors, and identifying noise distributions. This framework has broad applications in scientific and engineering fields, particularly in situations involving uncertainty analysis and design challenges. <div>
arXiv:2507.13416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is generalized to consider history-dependent multi-fidelity data, while quantifying epistemic uncertainty and disentangling it from data noise (aleatoric uncertainty). This generalization is hierarchical and adapts to different learning scenarios: from training the simplest single-fidelity deterministic neural networks up to the proposed multi-fidelity variance estimation Bayesian recurrent neural networks. The versatility and generality of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by applying it to different data-driven constitutive modeling scenarios that include multiple fidelities with and without aleatoric uncertainty (noise). The method accurately predicts the response and quantifies model error while also discovering the noise distribution (when present). This opens opportunities for future real-world applications in diverse scientific and engineering domains; especially, the most challenging cases involving design and analysis under uncertainty.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new algorithm called Soft-ECM for clustering complex data based on belief functions. Current algorithms for belief-based clustering do not handle mixed or non-tabular data efficiently due to their reliance on Euclidean spaces for barycenter construction. Soft-ECM addresses this limitation by reformulating the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem, enabling consistent positioning of centroids for imprecise clusters using semi-metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that Soft-ECM performs comparably to traditional fuzzy clustering on numerical data and excels in handling mixed data and integrating semi-metrics like DTW for time series data. Overall, Soft-ECM offers a versatile and effective solution for clustering diverse types of complex data with uncertainty and imprecision. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering based on belief functions has been gaining increasing attention in the machine learning community due to its ability to effectively represent uncertainty and/or imprecision. However, none of the existing algorithms can be applied to complex data, such as mixed data (numerical and categorical) or non-tabular data like time series. Indeed, these types of data are, in general, not represented in a Euclidean space and the aforementioned algorithms make use of the properties of such spaces, in particular for the construction of barycenters. In this paper, we reformulate the Evidential C-Means (ECM) problem for clustering complex data. We propose a new algorithm, Soft-ECM, which consistently positions the centroids of imprecise clusters requiring only a semi-metric. Our experiments show that Soft-ECM present results comparable to conventional fuzzy clustering approaches on numerical data, and we demonstrate its ability to handle mixed data and its benefits when combining fuzzy clustering with semi-metrics such as DTW for time series data.

Summary: 
By retraining a Bing-based convolutional network model with CORONA satellite imagery from the 1960s, the study improved the automated identification of archaeological sites in the Abu Ghraib district. The model achieved high precision in detecting archaeological sites, with IoU values exceeding 85% and an overall accuracy of 90%. Additionally, the retrained model successfully identified four previously undiscovered archaeological sites, which were subsequently verified in the field. This demonstrates the effectiveness of AI techniques and historical imagery in identifying archaeological sites that may no longer be visible due to human activity. This breakthrough has significant implications for the study of landscapes with disappearing archaeological evidence.  <div>

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad, central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising. First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest (confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

The model predicts upcoming clearances by analyzing interactions within static traffic scenarios. Importantly, it provides an interpretable task demand score per aircraft by systematically evaluating the impact of removing individual aircraft on predictions. The framework outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and established baselines, offering a more reliable estimate of scenario complexity. This tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, enabling a deeper analysis of complexity drivers for controller training and airspace redesign.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Real-time assessment of near-term Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) task demand is a critical challenge in an increasingly crowded airspace, as existing complexity metrics often fail to capture nuanced operational drivers beyond simple aircraft counts. This work introduces an interpretable Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to address this gap. Our attention-based model predicts the number of upcoming clearances, the instructions issued to aircraft by ATCOs, from interactions within static traffic scenarios. Crucially, we derive an interpretable, per-aircraft task demand score by systematically ablating aircraft and measuring the impact on the model's predictions. Our framework significantly outperforms an ATCO-inspired heuristic and is a more reliable estimator of scenario complexity than established baselines. The resulting tool can attribute task demand to specific aircraft, offering a new way to analyse and understand the drivers of complexity for applications in controller training and airspace redesign.

Summary: CaSTFormer is introduced as a causal spatio-temporal transformer to accurately predict driving intention by modeling causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context. It incorporates a Reciprocal Shift Fusion mechanism for temporal alignment, a Causal Pattern Extraction module for eliminating spurious correlations, and a Feature Synthesis Network for synthesizing purified representations. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Brain4Cars dataset, effectively capturing complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhancing both accuracy and transparency in driving intention prediction. <div>
arXiv:2507.13425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction. Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF) mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of driving intention prediction.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion. Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency. Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050 curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

Abstract: Surrogate models for the rapid inference of nonlinear boundary value problems in mechanics are helpful in a broad range of engineering applications. However, effective surrogate modeling of applications involving the contact of deformable bodies, especially in the context of varying geometries, is still an open issue. In particular, existing methods are confined to rigid body contact or, at best, contact between rigid and soft objects with well-defined contact planes. Furthermore, they employ contact or collision detection filters that serve as a rapid test but use only the necessary and not sufficient conditions for detection. In this work, we present a graph neural network architecture that utilizes continuous collision detection and, for the first time, incorporates sufficient conditions designed for contact between soft deformable bodies. We test its performance on two benchmarks, including a problem in soft tissue mechanics of predicting the closed state of a bioprosthetic aortic valve. We find a regularizing effect on adding additional contact terms to the loss function, leading to better generalization of the network. These benefits hold for simple contact at similar planes and element normal angles, and complex contact at differing planes and element normal angles. We also demonstrate that the framework can handle varying reference geometries. However, such benefits come with high computational costs during training, resulting in a trade-off that may not always be favorable. We quantify the training cost and the resulting inference speedups on various hardware architectures. Importantly, our graph neural network implementation results in up to a thousand-fold speedup for our benchmark problems at inference.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether. Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness, energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale. We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in the same network.

<title>AI-Assisted Fixes to Code Review Comments at Scale</title>

Abstract: Aim. There are 10s of thousands of code review comments each week at Meta. We developed Metamate for Code Review (MetaMateCR) that provides AI-assisted fixes for reviewer comments in production at scale.
  Method. We developed an internal benchmark of 64k  data points to fine-tune Llama models. Once our models achieve reasonable offline results, we roll them into production. To ensure that our AI-assisted fixes do not negatively impact the time it takes to do code reviews, we conduct randomized controlled safety trials as well as full production experiments.
  Offline Results. As a baseline, we compare GPT-4o to our small and large Llama models. In offline results, our LargeLSFT model creates an exact match patch 68% of the time outperforming GPT-4o by 9 percentage points (pp). The internal models also use more modern Hack functions when compared to the PHP functions suggested by GPT-4o.
  Safety Trial. When we roll MetaMateCR into production in a safety trial that compares no AI patches with AI patch suggestions, we see a large regression with reviewers taking over 5% longer to conduct reviews.

Abstract: Cybersecurity simulation environments, such as cyber ranges, honeypots, and sandboxes, require realistic human behavior to be effective, yet no quantitative method exists to assess the behavioral fidelity of synthetic user personas. This paper presents PHASE (Passive Human Activity Simulation Evaluation), a machine learning framework that analyzes Zeek connection logs and distinguishes human from non-human activity with over 90\% accuracy. PHASE operates entirely passively, relying on standard network monitoring without any user-side instrumentation or visible signs of surveillance. All network activity used for machine learning is collected via a Zeek network appliance to avoid introducing unnecessary network traffic or artifacts that could disrupt the fidelity of the simulation environment. The paper also proposes a novel labeling approach that utilizes local DNS records to classify network traffic, thereby enabling machine learning analysis. Furthermore, we apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis to uncover temporal and behavioral signatures indicative of genuine human users. In a case study, we evaluate a synthetic user persona and identify distinct non-human patterns that undermine behavioral realism. Based on these insights, we develop a revised behavioral configuration that significantly improves the human-likeness of synthetic activity yielding a more realistic and effective synthetic user persona.

Abstract: Partner selection is crucial for cooperation and hinges on communication. As artificial agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs), become more autonomous, intelligent, and persuasive, they compete with humans for partnerships. Yet little is known about how humans select between human and AI partners and adapt under AI-induced competition pressure. We constructed a communication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid mini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through three experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than humans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially when their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour to humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it reduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually outcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each partner type. These findings show how AI can reshape social interaction in mixed societies and inform the design of more effective and cooperative hybrid systems.

<title>Acoustic Index: A Novel AI-Driven Parameter for Cardiac Disease Risk Stratification Using Echocardiography</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13542</link>

Abstract: Traditional echocardiographic parameters such as ejection fraction (EF) and global longitudinal strain (GLS) have limitations in the early detection of cardiac dysfunction. EF often remains normal despite underlying pathology, and GLS is influenced by load conditions and vendor variability. There is a growing need for reproducible, interpretable, and operator-independent parameters that capture subtle and global cardiac functional alterations.
  We introduce the Acoustic Index, a novel AI-derived echocardiographic parameter designed to quantify cardiac dysfunction from standard ultrasound views. The model combines Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) based on Koopman operator theory with a hybrid neural network that incorporates clinical metadata. Spatiotemporal dynamics are extracted from echocardiographic sequences to identify coherent motion patterns. These are weighted via attention mechanisms and fused with clinical data using manifold learning, resulting in a continuous score from 0 (low risk) to 1 (high risk).
  In a prospective cohort of 736 patients, encompassing various cardiac pathologies and normal controls, the Acoustic Index achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89 in an independent test set. Cross-validation across five folds confirmed the robustness of the model, showing that both sensitivity and specificity exceeded 0.8 when evaluated on independent data. Threshold-based analysis demonstrated stable trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, with optimal discrimination near this threshold.
  The Acoustic Index represents a physics-informed, interpretable AI biomarker for cardiac function. It shows promise as a scalable, vendor-independent tool for early detection, triage, and longitudinal monitoring. Future directions include external validation, longitudinal studies, and adaptation to disease-specific classifiers.

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

<title>Reading Between the Lines: Combining Pause Dynamics and Semantic Coherence for Automated Assessment of Thought Disorder</title>

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries (AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to \r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best \r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

<title>Time Series Forecastability Measures</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes using two metrics to quantify the forecastability of time series prior to model development: the spectral predictability score and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Unlike traditional model evaluation metrics, these measures assess the inherent forecastability characteristics of the data before any forecast attempts. The spectral predictability score evaluates the strength and regularity of frequency components in the time series, whereas the Lyapunov exponents quantify the chaos and stability of the system generating the data. We evaluated the effectiveness of these metrics on both synthetic and real-world time series from the M5 forecast competition dataset. Our results demonstrate that these two metrics can correctly reflect the inherent forecastability of a time series and have a strong correlation with the actual forecast performance of various models. By understanding the inherent forecastability of time series before model training, practitioners can focus their planning efforts on products and supply chain levels that are more forecastable, while setting appropriate expectations or seeking alternative strategies for products with limited forecastability.

Abstract: Transformers evaluated in a single, fixed-depth pass are provably limited in expressive power to the constant-depth circuit class TC0. Running a Transformer autoregressively removes that ceiling -- first in next-token prediction and, more recently, in chain-of-thought reasoning. Both regimes rely on feedback loops that decode internal states into tokens only to re-encode them in subsequent steps. While this "thinking aloud" mirrors human reasoning, biological brains iterate without externalising intermediate states as language. To boost the expressive power of encoder Transformers without resorting to token-level autoregression, we introduce the SELF-Transformer: an encoder layer that iteratively refines its own attention weights to a fixed point. Instead of producing -- in one pass -- the alignment matrix that remixes the input sequence, the SELF-Transformer iteratively updates that matrix internally, scaling test-time computation with input difficulty. This adaptivity yields up to 20\% accuracy gains on encoder-style benchmarks without increasing parameter count, demonstrating that input-adaptive alignment at test time offers substantial benefits for only a modest extra compute budget. Self-Transformers thus recover much of the expressive power of iterative reasoning while preserving the simplicity of pure encoder architectures.

Abstract: We introduce two multilingual, multimodal foundation language models that power Apple Intelligence features across Apple devices and services: i a 3B-parameter on-device model optimized for Apple silicon through architectural innovations such as KV-cache sharing and 2-bit quantization-aware training; and ii a scalable server model built on a novel Parallel-Track Mixture-of-Experts PT-MoE transformer that combines track parallelism, mixture-of-experts sparse computation, and interleaved global-local attention to deliver high quality with competitive cost on Apple's Private Cloud Compute platform. Both models are trained on large-scale multilingual and multimodal datasets sourced via responsible web crawling, licensed corpora, and high-quality synthetic data, then further refined with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on a new asynchronous platform. The resulting models support several additional languages while understanding images and executing tool calls. In public benchmarks and human evaluations, both the server model and the on-device model match or surpass comparably sized open baselines.
  A new Swift-centric Foundation Models framework exposes guided generation, constrained tool calling, and LoRA adapter fine-tuning, allowing developers to integrate these capabilities with a few lines of code. The latest advancements in Apple Intelligence models are grounded in our Responsible AI approach with safeguards like content filtering and locale-specific evaluation, as well as our commitment to protecting our users' privacy with innovations like Private Cloud Compute.

Abstract: As everyday use cases of large language model (LLM) AI assistants have expanded, it is becoming increasingly important to personalize responses to align to different users' preferences and goals. While reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is effective at improving LLMs to be generally more helpful and fluent, it does not account for variability across users, as it models the entire user population with a single reward model. We present a novel framework, Preference Learning Using Summarization (PLUS), that learns text-based summaries of each user's preferences, characteristics, and past conversations. These summaries condition the reward model, enabling it to make personalized predictions about the types of responses valued by each user. We train the user-summarization model with reinforcement learning, and update the reward model simultaneously, creating an online co-adaptation loop. We show that in contrast with prior personalized RLHF techniques or with in-context learning of user information, summaries produced by PLUS capture meaningful aspects of a user's preferences. Across different pluralistic user datasets, we show that our method is robust to new users and diverse conversation topics. Additionally, we demonstrate that the textual summaries generated about users can be transferred for zero-shot personalization of stronger, proprietary models like GPT-4. The resulting user summaries are not only concise and portable, they are easy for users to interpret and modify, allowing for more transparency and user control in LLM alignment.

Abstract: We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend diffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their ability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety checkers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under adversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe data. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while maintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method significantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while maintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial fine-tuning attacks.

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist. Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet, UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone, with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data at a later date.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs. Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models, including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and applications.

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation. The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID. The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities, with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions. We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework. The benchmark dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras (C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22% 3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide range of long-context dialogue tasks.

Abstract: Physics-inspired graph neural networks (PI-GNNs) have been utilized as an efficient unsupervised framework for relaxing combinatorial optimization problems encoded through a specific graph structure and loss, reflecting dependencies between the problem's variables. While the framework has yielded promising results in various combinatorial problems, we show that the performance of PI-GNNs systematically plummets with an increasing density of the combinatorial problem graphs. Our analysis reveals an interesting phase transition in the PI-GNNs' training dynamics, associated with degenerate solutions for the denser problems, highlighting a discrepancy between the relaxed, real-valued model outputs and the binary-valued problem solutions. To address the discrepancy, we propose principled alternatives to the naive strategy used in PI-GNNs by building on insights from fuzzy logic and binarized neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate that the portfolio of proposed methods significantly improves the performance of PI-GNNs in increasingly dense settings.

Abstract: Point of interest (POI) recommendation can play a pivotal role in enriching tourists' experiences by suggesting context-dependent and preference-matching locations and activities, such as restaurants, landmarks, itineraries, and cultural attractions. Unlike some more common recommendation domains (e.g., music and video), POI recommendation is inherently high-stakes: users invest significant time, money, and effort to search, choose, and consume these suggested POIs. Despite the numerous research works in the area, several fundamental issues remain unresolved, hindering the real-world applicability of the proposed approaches. In this paper, we discuss the current status of the POI recommendation problem and the main challenges we have identified. The first contribution of this paper is a critical assessment of the current state of POI recommendation research and the identification of key shortcomings across three main dimensions: datasets, algorithms, and evaluation methodologies. We highlight persistent issues such as the lack of standardized benchmark datasets, flawed assumptions in the problem definition and model design, and inadequate treatment of biases in the user behavior and system performance. The second contribution is a structured research agenda that, starting from the identified issues, introduces important directions for future work related to multistakeholder design, context awareness, data collection, trustworthiness, novel interactions, and real-world evaluation.

<title>AGENTS-LLM: Augmentative GENeration of Challenging Traffic Scenarios with an Agentic LLM Framework</title>

Abstract: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created manually.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions. Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in graph classification tasks by capturing both structural and feature-based representations. However, real-world graphs often exhibit two critical forms of imbalance: class imbalance and graph size imbalance. These imbalances can bias the learning process and degrade model performance. Existing methods typically address only one type of imbalance or incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose SamGoG, a sampling-based Graph-of-Graphs (GoG) learning framework that effectively mitigates both class and graph size imbalance. SamGoG constructs multiple GoGs through an efficient importance-based sampling mechanism and trains on them sequentially. This sampling mechanism incorporates the learnable pairwise similarity and adaptive GoG node degree to enhance edge homophily, thus improving downstream model quality. SamGoG can seamlessly integrate with various downstream GNNs, enabling their efficient adaptation for graph classification tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SamGoG achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to a 15.66% accuracy improvement with 6.7$\times$ training acceleration.

Abstract: In the fast-moving world of AI, as organizations and researchers develop more advanced models, they face challenges due to their sheer size and computational demands. Deploying such models on edge devices or in resource-constrained environments adds further challenges related to energy consumption, memory usage and latency. To address these challenges, emerging trends are shaping the future of efficient model optimization techniques. From this premise, by employing supervised state-of-the-art transformer-based models, this research introduces a systematic method for ontology alignment, grounded in cosine-based semantic similarity between a biomedical layman vocabulary and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus. It leverages Microsoft Olive to search for target optimizations among different Execution Providers (EPs) using the ONNX Runtime backend, followed by an assembled process of dynamic quantization employing Intel Neural Compressor and IPEX (Intel Extension for PyTorch). Through our optimization process, we conduct extensive assessments on the two tasks from the DEFT 2020 Evaluation Campaign, achieving a new state-of-the-art in both. We retain performance metrics intact, while attaining an average inference speed-up of 20x and reducing memory usage by approximately 70%.

<title>Learning Spectral Diffusion Prior for Hyperspectral Image Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI reconstruction.

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular diagnostics.

<title>One Step Closer: Creating the Future to Boost Monocular Semantic Scene Completion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.13801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past, present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships. Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and 3D scene completion accuracy.

Abstract: In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food products, offering great opportunities for artificial intelligence to analyze trends, predict hazards, and support early warning systems. However, the current format with data distributed across approximately 1000 files totaling several hundred gigabytes hinders accessibility and analysis. To address this, we introduce the CompreHensive European Food Safety (CHEFS) database, which consolidates EFSA monitoring data on pesticide residues, veterinary medicinal product residues, and chemical contaminants into a unified and structured dataset. We describe the creation and structure of the CHEFS database and demonstrate its potential by analyzing trends in European food safety monitoring data from 2000 to 2024. Our analyses explore changes in monitoring activities, the most frequently tested products, which products were most often non-compliant and which contaminants were most often found, and differences across countries. These findings highlight the CHEFS database as both a centralized data source and a strategic tool for guiding food safety policy, research, and regulation.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for open-ended video question answering that enhances reasoning depth and robustness in complex real-world scenarios, as benchmarked on the CVRR-ES dataset. Existing Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs) often exhibit limited contextual understanding, weak temporal modeling, and poor generalization to ambiguous or compositional queries. To address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs) via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways. An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator, selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for future Video-LMM development.

Abstract: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations, including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations (covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance applications.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (abbreviated as RL), an agent interacts with the environment via a set of possible actions, and a reward is generated from some unknown distribution. The task here is to find an optimal set of actions such that the reward after a certain time step gets maximized. In a traditional setup, the reward function in an RL Problem is considered additive. However, in reality, there exist many problems, including path planning, coverage control, etc., the reward function follows the diminishing return, which can be modeled as a submodular function. In this paper, we study a variant of the RL Problem where the reward function is submodular, and our objective is to find an optimal policy such that this reward function gets maximized. We have proposed a pruned submodularity graph-based approach that provides a provably approximate solution in a feasible computation time. The proposed approach has been analyzed to understand its time and space requirements as well as a performance guarantee. We have experimented with a benchmark agent-environment setup, which has been used for similar previous studies, and the results are reported. From the results, we observe that the policy obtained by our proposed approach leads to more reward than the baseline methods.

<title>SPARQL Query Generation with LLMs: Measuring the Impact of Training Data Memorization and Knowledge Injection</title>

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems, generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf. LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM, s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is possible.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries, enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in dynamic and challenging environments.

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

Abstract: Predicting phenotypes from gene expression data is a crucial task in biomedical research, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, drug responses, and personalized medicine. Traditional machine learning and deep learning rely on supervised learning, which requires large quantities of labeled data that are costly and time-consuming to obtain in the case of gene expression data. Self-supervised learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to overcome these limitations by extracting information directly from the structure of unlabeled data. In this study, we investigate the application of state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods to bulk gene expression data for phenotype prediction. We selected three self-supervised methods, based on different approaches, to assess their ability to exploit the inherent structure of the data and to generate qualitative representations which can be used for downstream predictive tasks. By using several publicly available gene expression datasets, we demonstrate how the selected methods can effectively capture complex information and improve phenotype prediction accuracy. The results obtained show that self-supervised learning methods can outperform traditional supervised models besides offering significant advantage by reducing the dependency on annotated data. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the performance of each method by highlighting their strengths and limitations. We also provide recommendations for using these methods depending on the case under study. Finally, we outline future research directions to enhance the application of self-supervised learning in the field of gene expression data analysis. This study is the first work that deals with bulk RNA-Seq data and self-supervised learning.

To address this limitation, we compile a diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims. Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27% respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly, where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased factual accuracy.

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models (LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient, because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content has complex markup and diverse genres.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web ecosystem.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight, task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video understanding.

<title>Exploiting Primacy Effect To Improve Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP applications.

Abstract: The modern recommender systems are facing an increasing challenge of modelling and predicting the dynamic and context-rich user preferences. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based methods often struggle to capture the temporal patternings and evolving user intentions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained gradual attention in recent years, by their strong semantic understanding and reasoning abilities, they are not inherently designed to model chronologically evolving user preference and intentions. On the other hand, for sequential models like LSTM (Long-Short-Term-Memory) which is good at capturing the temporal dynamics of user behaviour and evolving user preference over time, but still lacks a rich semantic understanding for comprehensive recommendation generation. In this study, we propose DUALRec (Dynamic User-Aware Language-based Recommender), a novel recommender that leverages the complementary strength of both models, which combines the temporal modelling abilities of LSTM networks with semantic reasoning power of the fine-tuned Large Language Models. The LSTM component will capture users evolving preference through their viewing history, while the fine-tuned LLM variants will leverage these temporal user insights to generate next movies that users might enjoy. Experimental results on MovieLens-1M dataset shows that the DUALRec model outperforms a wide range of baseline models, with comprehensive evaluation matrices of Hit Rate (HR@k), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG@k), and genre similarity metrics. This research proposes a novel architecture that bridges the gap between temporal sequence modeling and semantic reasoning, and offers a promising direction for developing more intelligent and context-aware recommenders.

<title>Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph is What We Need</title>

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

Abstract: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Abstract: The growing volume of medical imaging data has increased the need for automated diagnostic tools, especially for musculoskeletal injuries like rib fractures, commonly detected via CT scans. Manual interpretation is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose OrthoInsight, a multi-modal deep learning framework for rib fracture diagnosis and report generation. It integrates a YOLOv9 model for fracture detection, a medical knowledge graph for retrieving clinical context, and a fine-tuned LLaVA language model for generating diagnostic reports. OrthoInsight combines visual features from CT images with expert textual data to deliver clinically useful outputs. Evaluated on 28,675 annotated CT images and expert reports, it achieves high performance across Diagnostic Accuracy, Content Completeness, Logical Coherence, and Clinical Guidance Value, with an average score of 4.28, outperforming models like GPT-4 and Claude-3. This study demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in transforming medical image analysis and providing effective support for radiologists.

Abstract: This paper presents the Photonic FabricTM and the Photonic Fabric ApplianceTM (PFA), a photonic-enabled switch and memory subsystem that delivers low latency, high bandwidth, and low per-bit energy. By integrating high-bandwidth HBM3E memory, an on-module photonic switch, and external DDR5 in a 2.5D electro-optical system-in-package, the PFA offers up to 32 TB of shared memory alongside 115 Tbps of all-to-all digital switching. The Photonic FabricTM enables distributed AI training and inference to execute parallelism strategies more efficiently. The Photonic Fabric removes the silicon beachfront constraint that limits the fixed memory-to-compute ratio observed in virtually all current XPU accelerator designs. Replacing a local HBM stack on an XPU with a chiplet that connects to the Photonic Fabric increases its memory capacity and correspondingly its memory bandwidth by offering a flexible path to scaling well beyond the limitations of on-package HBM alone. We introduce CelestiSim, a lightweight analytical simulator validated on NVIDIA H100 and H200 systems. It is used to evaluate the performance of LLM reference and energy savings on PFA, without any significant change to the GPU core design. With the PFA, the simulation results show that up to 3.66x throughput and 1.40x latency improvements in LLM inference at 405B parameters, up to 7.04x throughput and 1.41x latency improvements at 1T parameters, and 60-90% energy savings in data movement for heavy collective operations in all LLM training scenarios. While these results are shown for NVIDIA GPUs, they can be applied similarly to other AI accelerator designs (XPUs) that share the same fundamental limitation of fixed memory to compute.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion, effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for application.

Abstract: Recent studies in continual learning have identified a transient drop in performance on mastered tasks when assimilating new ones, known as the stability gap. Such dynamics contradict the objectives of continual learning, revealing a lack of robustness in mitigating forgetting, and notably, persisting even under an ideal joint-loss regime. Examining this gap within this idealized joint training context is critical to isolate it from other sources of forgetting. We argue that it reflects an imbalance between rapid adaptation and robust retention at task boundaries, underscoring the need to investigate mechanisms that reconcile plasticity and stability within continual learning frameworks. Biological brains navigate a similar dilemma by operating concurrently on multiple timescales, leveraging neuromodulatory signals to modulate synaptic plasticity. However, artificial networks lack native multitimescale dynamics, and although optimizers like momentum-SGD and Adam introduce implicit timescale regularization, they still exhibit stability gaps. Inspired by locus coeruleus mediated noradrenergic bursts, which transiently enhance neuronal gain under uncertainty to facilitate sensory assimilation, we propose uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics - an adaptive mechanism that approximates a two-timescale optimizer and dynamically balances integration of knowledge with minimal interference on previously consolidated information. We evaluate our mechanism on domain-incremental and class-incremental variants of the MNIST and CIFAR benchmarks under joint training, demonstrating that uncertainty-modulated gain dynamics effectively attenuate the stability gap. Finally, our analysis elucidates how gain modulation replicates noradrenergic functions in cortical circuits, offering mechanistic insights into reducing stability gaps and enhance performance in continual learning tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable. We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination. Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and edge computing has spurred growing interest in enabling intelligent services directly on resource-constrained devices. While traditional deep learning models require significant computational resources and centralized data management, the resulting latency, bandwidth consumption, and privacy concerns have exposed critical limitations in cloud-centric paradigms. Brain-inspired computing, particularly Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), offers a promising alternative by emulating biological neuronal dynamics to achieve low-power, event-driven computation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Edge Intelligence based on SNNs (EdgeSNNs), examining their potential to address the challenges of on-device learning, inference, and security in edge scenarios. We present a systematic taxonomy of EdgeSNN foundations, encompassing neuron models, learning algorithms, and supporting hardware platforms. Three representative practical considerations of EdgeSNN are discussed in depth: on-device inference using lightweight SNN models, resource-aware training and updating under non-stationary data conditions, and secure and privacy-preserving issues. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations of evaluating EdgeSNNs on conventional hardware and introduce a dual-track benchmarking strategy to support fair comparisons and hardware-aware optimization. Through this study, we aim to bridge the gap between brain-inspired learning and practical edge deployment, offering insights into current advancements, open challenges, and future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dedicated and comprehensive survey on EdgeSNNs, providing an essential reference for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of neuromorphic computing and edge intelligence.

<title>DENSE: Longitudinal Progress Note Generation with Temporal Modeling of Heterogeneous Clinical Notes Across Hospital Visits</title>

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings.

Abstract: Humans have a selective memory, remembering relevant episodes and forgetting the less relevant information. Possessing awareness of event memorability for a user could help intelligent systems in more accurate user modelling, especially for such applications as meeting support systems, memory augmentation, and meeting summarisation. Emotion recognition has been widely studied, since emotions are thought to signal moments of high personal relevance to users. The emotional experience of situations and their memorability have traditionally been considered to be closely tied to one another: moments that are experienced as highly emotional are considered to also be highly memorable. This relationship suggests that emotional annotations could serve as proxies for memorability. However, existing emotion recognition systems rely heavily on third-party annotations, which may not accurately represent the first-person experience of emotional relevance and memorability. This is why, in this study, we empirically examine the relationship between perceived group emotions (Pleasure-Arousal) and group memorability in the context of conversational interactions. Our investigation involves continuous time-based annotations of both emotions and memorability in dynamic, unstructured group settings, approximating conditions of real-world conversational AI applications such as online meeting support systems. Our results show that the observed relationship between affect and memorability annotations cannot be reliably distinguished from what might be expected under random chance. We discuss the implications of this surprising finding for the development and applications of Affective Computing technology. In addition, we contextualise our findings in broader discourses in the Affective Computing and point out important targets for future research efforts.

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on 103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of 3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59). These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres, suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability, combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references. Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track, with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic, reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments. In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction, edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains, resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly, removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x, enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our experiments.

<title>Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) for Imbalanced Data -- An Empirical Perspective</title>

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs) are recent architectural advancement in neural computation that offer a mathematically grounded alternative to standard neural networks. This study presents an empirical evaluation of KANs in context of class imbalanced classification, using ten benchmark datasets. We observe that KANs can inherently perform well on raw imbalanced data more effectively than Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) without any resampling strategy. However, conventional imbalance strategies fundamentally conflict with KANs mathematical structure as resampling and focal loss implementations significantly degrade KANs performance, while marginally benefiting MLPs. Crucially, KANs suffer from prohibitive computational costs without proportional performance gains. Statistical validation confirms that MLPs with imbalance techniques achieve equivalence with KANs (|d| < 0.08 across metrics) at minimal resource costs. These findings reveal that KANs represent a specialized solution for raw imbalanced data where resources permit. But their severe performance-resource tradeoffs and incompatibility with standard resampling techniques currently limits practical deployment. We identify critical research priorities as developing KAN specific architectural modifications for imbalance learning, optimizing computational efficiency, and theoretical reconciling their conflict with data augmentation. This work establishes foundational insights for next generation KAN architectures in imbalanced classification scenarios.

Abstract: Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information. In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability of causal representations.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis is an active research area that combines multiple data modalities, e.g., text, image and audio, to analyze human emotions and benefits a variety of applications. Existing multimodal sentiment analysis methods can be classified as modality interaction-based methods, modality transformation-based methods and modality similarity-based methods. However, most of these methods highly rely on the strong correlations between modalities, and cannot fully uncover and utilize the correlations between modalities to enhance sentiment analysis. Therefore, these methods usually achieve bad performance for identifying the sentiment of multimodal data with weak correlations. To address this issue, we proposed a two-stage semi-supervised model termed Correlation-aware Multimodal Transformer (CorMulT) which consists pre-training stage and prediction stage. At the pre-training stage, a modality correlation contrastive learning module is designed to efficiently learn modality correlation coefficients between different modalities. At the prediction stage, the learned correlation coefficients are fused with modality representations to make the sentiment prediction. According to the experiments on the popular multimodal dataset CMU-MOSEI, CorMulT obviously surpasses state-of-the-art multimodal sentiment analysis methods.

Abstract: Visual emotion analysis holds significant research value in both computer vision and psychology. However, existing methods for visual emotion analysis suffer from limited generalizability due to the ambiguity of emotion perception and the diversity of data scenarios. To tackle this issue, we introduce UniEmoX, a cross-modal semantic-guided large-scale pretraining framework. Inspired by psychological research emphasizing the inseparability of the emotional exploration process from the interaction between individuals and their environment, UniEmoX integrates scene-centric and person-centric low-level image spatial structural information, aiming to derive more nuanced and discriminative emotional representations. By exploiting the similarity between paired and unpaired image-text samples, UniEmoX distills rich semantic knowledge from the CLIP model to enhance emotional embedding representations more effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale pretraining framework that integrates psychological theories with contemporary contrastive learning and masked image modeling techniques for emotion analysis across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we develop a visual emotional dataset titled Emo8. Emo8 samples cover a range of domains, including cartoon, natural, realistic, science fiction and advertising cover styles, covering nearly all common emotional scenes. Comprehensive experiments conducted on six benchmark datasets across two downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of UniEmoX. The source code is available at https://github.com/chincharles/u-emo.

<title>BLAST: A Stealthy Backdoor Leverage Attack against Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning based Systems</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (c-MADRL) is under the threat of backdoor attacks. Once a backdoor trigger is observed, it will perform malicious actions leading to failures or malicious goals. However, existing backdoor attacks suffer from several issues, e.g., instant trigger patterns lack stealthiness, the backdoor is trained or activated by an additional network, or all agents are backdoored. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel backdoor leverage attack against c-MADRL, BLAST, which attacks the entire multi-agent team by embedding the backdoor only in a single agent. Firstly, we introduce adversary spatiotemporal behavior patterns as the backdoor trigger rather than manual-injected fixed visual patterns or instant status and control the period to perform malicious actions. This method can guarantee the stealthiness and practicality of BLAST. Secondly, we hack the original reward function of the backdoor agent via unilateral guidance to inject BLAST, so as to achieve the \textit{leverage attack effect} that can pry open the entire multi-agent system via a single backdoor agent. We evaluate our BLAST against 3 classic c-MADRL algorithms (VDN, QMIX, and MAPPO) in 2 popular c-MADRL environments (SMAC and Pursuit), and 2 existing defense mechanisms. The experimental results demonstrate that BLAST can achieve a high attack success rate while maintaining a low clean performance variance rate.

<title>To Code or not to Code? Adaptive Tool Integration for Math Language Models via Expectation-Maximization</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training.
  While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles requires virtual scenario-based testing, which depends on the robust evaluation and generation of safety-critical scenarios. So far, researchers have used scenario-based testing frameworks that rely heavily on handcrafted scenarios as safety metrics. To reduce the effort of human interpretation and overcome the limited scalability of these approaches, we combine Large Language Models (LLMs) with structured scenario parsing and prompt engineering to automatically evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios. We introduce Cartesian and Ego-centric prompt strategies for scenario evaluation, and an adversarial generation module that modifies trajectories of risk-inducing vehicles (ego-attackers) to create critical scenarios. We validate our approach using a 2D simulation framework and multiple pre-trained LLMs. The results show that the evaluation module effectively detects collision scenarios and infers scenario safety. Meanwhile, the new generation module identifies high-risk agents and synthesizes realistic, safety-critical scenarios. We conclude that an LLM equipped with domain-informed prompting techniques can effectively evaluate and generate safety-critical driving scenarios, reducing dependence on handcrafted metrics. We release our open-source code and scenarios at: https://github.com/TUM-AVS/From-Words-to-Collisions.

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning with large language models (RLLMs), such as OpenAI-O1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated their impressive capabilities in complex domains like mathematics and coding. A central factor in their success lies in the application of long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) characteristics, which enhance reasoning abilities and enable the solution of intricate problems. However, despite these developments, a comprehensive survey on Long CoT is still lacking, limiting our understanding of its distinctions from traditional short chain-of-thought (Short CoT) and complicating ongoing debates on issues like "overthinking" and "inference-time scaling." This survey seeks to fill this gap by offering a unified perspective on Long CoT. (1) We first distinguish Long CoT from Short CoT and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize current reasoning paradigms. (2) Next, we explore the key characteristics of Long CoT: deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and feasible reflection, which enable models to handle more complex tasks and produce more efficient, coherent outcomes compared to the shallower Short CoT. (3) We then investigate key phenomena such as the emergence of Long CoT with these characteristics, including overthinking, and inference-time scaling, offering insights into how these processes manifest in practice. (4) Finally, we identify significant research gaps and highlight promising future directions, including the integration of multi-modal reasoning, efficiency improvements, and enhanced knowledge frameworks. By providing a structured overview, this survey aims to inspire future research and further the development of logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is an established field of research. Yet some have questioned if the term still has meaning. AGI has been subject to so much hype and speculation it has become something of a Rorschach test. Melanie Mitchell argues the debate will only be settled through long term, scientific investigation. To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my cue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware. Now the bottlenecks are sample and energy efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications such as "digital assistants, autonomous customer service, and decision-support systems", where their ability to "interact in multi-turn, tool-augmented environments" makes them indispensable. However, ensuring the safety of these agents remains a significant challenge due to the diverse and complex risks arising from dynamic user interactions, external tool usage, and the potential for unintended harmful behaviors. To address this critical issue, we propose AutoSafe, the first framework that systematically enhances agent safety through fully automated synthetic data generation. Concretely, 1) we introduce an open and extensible threat model, OTS, which formalizes how unsafe behaviors emerge from the interplay of user instructions, interaction contexts, and agent actions. This enables precise modeling of safety risks across diverse scenarios. 2) we develop a fully automated data generation pipeline that simulates unsafe user behaviors, applies self-reflective reasoning to generate safe responses, and constructs a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality safety training dataset-eliminating the need for hazardous real-world data collection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework, we design comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world safety benchmarks. Results demonstrate that AutoSafe boosts safety scores by 45% on average and achieves a 28.91% improvement on real-world tasks, validating the generalization ability of our learned safety strategies. These results highlight the practical advancement and scalability of AutoSafe in building safer LLM-based agents for real-world deployment. We have released the project page at https://auto-safe.github.io/.

Abstract: By late 20th century, the rationality wars had launched debates about the nature and norms of intuitive and reflective thinking. Those debates drew from mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual pro-cess theories to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflec-tivism, the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to opti-mally fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism, transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or chains of thought, applies to both individual and collective intelligence systems (including human-AI teams), and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about the value of intuition and reflection.

Abstract: Recent generations of language models have introduced Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that generate detailed thinking processes before providing answers. While these models demonstrate improved performance on reasoning benchmarks, their fundamental capabilities, scaling properties, and limitations remain insufficiently understood. Current evaluations primarily focus on established math and coding benchmarks, emphasizing final answer accuracy. However, this evaluation paradigm often suffers from contamination and does not provide insights into the reasoning traces. In this work, we systematically investigate these gaps with the help of controllable puzzle environments that allow precise manipulation of complexity while maintaining consistent logical structures. This setup enables the analysis of not only final answers but also the internal reasoning traces, offering insights into how LRMs think. Through extensive experiments, we show that LRMs face a complete accuracy collapse beyond certain complexities. Moreover, they exhibit a counterintuitive scaling limit: their reasoning effort increases with problem complexity up to a point, then declines despite having remaining token budget. By comparing LRMs with their standard LLM counterparts under same inference compute, we identify three performance regimes: (1) low-complexity tasks where standard models outperform LRMs, (2) medium-complexity tasks where LRMs demonstrates advantage, and (3) high-complexity tasks where both models face complete collapse. We found that LRMs have limitations in exact computation: they fail to use explicit algorithms and reason inconsistently across scales. We also investigate the reasoning traces in more depth, studying the patterns of explored solutions and analyzing the models' computational behavior, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and raising questions about their reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have set state-of-the-art (SOTA) records on many challenging benchmarks, enabled by multi-step reasoning induced using reinforcement learning. However, like previous language models, reasoning models are prone to generating confident, plausible responses that are incorrect (hallucinations). Knowing when and how much to trust these models is critical to the safe deployment of reasoning models in real-world applications. To this end, we explore uncertainty quantification of reasoning models in this work. Specifically, we ask three fundamental questions: First, are reasoning models well-calibrated? Second, does deeper reasoning improve model calibration? Finally, inspired by humans' innate ability to double-check their thought processes to verify the validity of their answers and their confidence, we ask: can reasoning models improve their calibration by explicitly reasoning about their chain-of-thought traces? We introduce introspective uncertainty quantification (UQ) to explore this direction. In extensive evaluations on SOTA reasoning models across a broad range of benchmarks, we find that reasoning models: (i) are typically overconfident, with self-verbalized confidence estimates often greater than 85% particularly for incorrect responses, (ii) become even more overconfident with deeper reasoning, and (iii) can become better calibrated through introspection (e.g., o3-Mini and DeepSeek R1) but not uniformly (e.g., Claude 3.7 Sonnet becomes more poorly calibrated). Lastly, we conclude with important research directions to design necessary UQ benchmarks and improve the calibration of reasoning models.

Abstract: Traditional agent-based urban mobility simulations often rely on rigid rule-based systems that struggle to capture the complexity, adaptability, and behavioral diversity inherent in human travel decision making. Recent advancements in large language models and AI agent technologies present new opportunities to develop agents with enhanced reasoning capabilities, persistent memory, and adaptive learning. We introduce GATSim (Generative-Agent Transport Simulation), a novel framework that leverages these advancements to simulate urban mobility using generative agents with rich, human-like behaviors. Unlike conventional approaches, GATSim agents are characterized by diverse socioeconomic profiles, individual lifestyles, and evolving preferences shaped through psychologically informed memory systems, tool usage, and lifelong learning. The main contributions of this work are: (1) a comprehensive architecture that integrates an urban mobility foundation model with agent cognitive systems and a transport simulation environment; (2) a hierarchical memory designed for efficient retrieval of contextually relevant information, incorporating spatial and temporal associations, keyword matching, and semantic relevance; (3) innovative planning and reactive mechanisms for modeling adaptive mobility behaviors which integrate a multi-scale reflection process to transform specific travel experiences into generalized behavioral insights. We implement a prototype system and conduct systematic validation, demonstrating that generative agents produce believable and coherent travel behaviors. Experimental results indicate that generative agents perform at least as well as human annotators with 92\% posterior probability, while naturally producing realistic macroscopic traffic patterns. The code for the prototype implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/qiliuchn/gatsim.

Abstract: The latest developments in computer hardware, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence can make virtual reality (VR) and virtual spaces an important part of human everyday life. Eye tracking offers not only a hands-free way of interaction but also the possibility of a deeper understanding of human visual attention and cognitive processes in VR. Despite these possibilities, eye-tracking data also reveals users' privacy-sensitive attributes when combined with the information about the presented stimulus. To address all these possibilities and potential privacy issues, in this survey, we first cover major works in eye tracking, VR, and privacy areas between 2012 and 2022. While eye tracking in the VR part covers the complete pipeline of eye-tracking methodology from pupil detection and gaze estimation to offline use of the data and analyses, as for privacy and security, we focus on eye-based authentication as well as computational methods to preserve the privacy of individuals and their eye-tracking data in VR. Later, considering all of these, we draw three main directions for the research community by focusing on privacy challenges. In summary, this survey provides an extensive literature review of the utmost possibilities with eye tracking in VR and the privacy implications of those possibilities.

Abstract: We propose using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) as reverse transition operator (kernel) within the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) framework, which is one of the most widely used approaches for accelerated sampling from pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Specifically we match the first and second order central moments of the DDPM forward marginals by constraining the parameters of the GMM. We see that moment matching is sufficient to obtain samples with equal or better quality than the original DDIM with Gaussian kernels. We provide experimental results with unconditional models trained on CelebAHQ and FFHQ and class-conditional models trained on ImageNet datasets respectively. Our results suggest that using the GMM kernel leads to significant improvements in the quality of the generated samples when the number of sampling steps is small, as measured by FID and IS metrics. For example on ImageNet 256x256, using 10 sampling steps, we achieve a FID of 6.94 and IS of 207.85 with a GMM kernel compared to 10.15 and 196.73 respectively with a Gaussian kernel.

Abstract: Movement disorder diagnosis often relies on expert evaluation of patient videos, but sharing these videos poses privacy risks. Current methods for de-identifying videos, such as blurring faces, are often manual, inconsistent, or inaccurate. Furthermore, these methods can compromise objective kinematic analysis - a crucial component of diagnosis. To address these challenges, we developed SecurePose, an open-source software that simultaneously provides reliable de-identification and automated kinematic extraction from videos recorded in clinic settings using smartphones/tablets. SecurePose utilizes pose estimation (using OpenPose) to extract full body kinematics, track individuals, identify the patient, and then accurately blur faces in the videos. We validated SecurePose on gait videos recorded in outpatient clinic visits of 116 children with cerebral palsy, assessing both the accuracy of its de-identification compared to the ground truth (manual blurring) and the reliability of the intermediate steps of kinematics extraction. Results demonstrate that SecurePose outperformed six existing methods in automated face detection and achieved comparable accuracy to robust manual blurring, but in significantly less time (91.08% faster). Ten experienced researchers also confirmed SecurePose's usability via System Usability Scale scores. These findings validate SecurePose as a practical and effective tool for protecting patient privacy while enabling accurate kinematics extraction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Metaphors, although occasionally unperceived, are ubiquitous in our everyday language. Thus, it is crucial for Language Models to be able to grasp the underlying meaning of this kind of figurative language. In this work, we present Meta4XNLI, a novel parallel dataset for the tasks of metaphor detection and interpretation that contains metaphor annotations in both Spanish and English. We investigate language models' metaphor identification and understanding abilities through a series of monolingual and cross-lingual experiments by leveraging our proposed corpus. In order to comprehend how these non-literal expressions affect models' performance, we look over the results and perform an error analysis. Additionally, parallel data offers many potential opportunities to investigate metaphor transferability between these languages and the impact of translation on the development of multilingual annotated resources.

<title>Instruct-MusicGen: Unlocking Text-to-Music Editing for Music Language Models via Instruction Tuning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music editing, which employ text queries to modify music (e.g.\ by changing its style or adjusting instrumental components), present unique challenges and opportunities for AI-assisted music creation. Previous approaches in this domain have been constrained by the necessity to train specific editing models from scratch, which is both resource-intensive and inefficient; other research uses large language models to predict edited music, resulting in imprecise audio reconstruction. To Combine the strengths and address these limitations, we introduce Instruct-MusicGen, a novel approach that finetunes a pretrained MusicGen model to efficiently follow editing instructions such as adding, removing, or separating stems. Our approach involves a modification of the original MusicGen architecture by incorporating a text fusion module and an audio fusion module, which allow the model to process instruction texts and audio inputs concurrently and yield the desired edited music. Remarkably, Instruct-MusicGen only introduces 8% new parameters to the original MusicGen model and only trains for 5K steps, yet it achieves superior performance across all tasks compared to existing baselines, and demonstrates performance comparable to the models trained for specific tasks. This advancement not only enhances the efficiency of text-to-music editing but also broadens the applicability of music language models in dynamic music production environments.

Abstract: Most visual grounding solutions primarily focus on realistic images. However, applications involving synthetic images, such as Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), remain limited. This restricts the development of autonomous computer vision-powered artificial intelligence (AI) agents for automatic application interaction. Enabling AI to effectively understand and interact with GUIs is crucial to advancing automation in software testing, accessibility, and human-computer interaction. In this work, we explore Instruction Visual Grounding (IVG), a multi-modal approach to object identification within a GUI. More precisely, given a natural language instruction and a GUI screen, IVG locates the coordinates of the element on the screen where the instruction should be executed. We propose two main methods: (1) IVGocr, which combines a Large Language Model (LLM), an object detection model, and an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) module; and (2) IVGdirect, which uses a multimodal architecture for end-to-end grounding. For each method, we introduce a dedicated dataset. In addition, we propose the Central Point Validation (CPV) metric, a relaxed variant of the classical Central Proximity Score (CPS) metric. Our final test dataset is publicly released to support future research.

<title>On Pre-training of Multimodal Language Models Customized for Chart Understanding</title>

Abstract: Recent studies customizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for domain-specific tasks have yielded promising results, especially in the field of scientific chart comprehension. These studies generally utilize visual instruction tuning with specialized datasets to enhance question and answer (QA) accuracy within the chart domain. However, they often neglect the fundamental discrepancy between natural image-caption pre-training data and digital chart image-QA data, particularly in the models' capacity to extract underlying numeric values from charts. This paper tackles this oversight by exploring the training processes necessary to improve MLLMs' comprehension of charts. We present three key findings: (1) Incorporating raw data values in alignment pre-training markedly improves comprehension of chart data. (2) Replacing images with their textual representation randomly during end-to-end fine-tuning transfer the language reasoning capability to chart interpretation skills. (3) Requiring the model to first extract the underlying chart data and then answer the question in the fine-tuning can further improve the accuracy. Consequently, we introduce CHOPINLLM, an MLLM tailored for in-depth chart comprehension. CHOPINLLM effectively interprets various types of charts, including unannotated ones, while maintaining robust reasoning abilities. Furthermore, we establish a new benchmark to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of different chart types across various comprehension levels. Experimental results show that CHOPINLLM exhibits strong performance in understanding both annotated and unannotated charts across a wide range of types.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have been a revolutionary milestone in the evolution of generative AI and multimodal technology, allowing wonderful image generation with natural-language text prompt. However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

<title>Entropy Loss: An Interpretability Amplifier of 3D Object Detection Network for Intelligent Driving</title>

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of the traffic environment, the significance of safety perception in intelligent driving is intensifying. Traditional methods in the field of intelligent driving perception rely on deep learning, which suffers from limited interpretability, often described as a "black box." This paper introduces a novel type of loss function, termed "Entropy Loss," along with an innovative training strategy. Entropy Loss is formulated based on the functionality of feature compression networks within the perception model. Drawing inspiration from communication systems, the information transmission process in a feature compression network is expected to demonstrate steady changes in information volume and a continuous decrease in information entropy. By modeling network layer outputs as continuous random variables, we construct a probabilistic model that quantifies changes in information volume. Entropy Loss is then derived based on these expectations, guiding the update of network parameters to enhance network interpretability. Our experiments indicate that the Entropy Loss training strategy accelerates the training process. Utilizing the same 60 training epochs, the accuracy of 3D object detection models using Entropy Loss on the KITTI test set improved by up to 4.47\% compared to models without Entropy Loss, underscoring the method's efficacy. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/yhbcode000/Eloss-Interpretability.

Abstract: Although AlphaZero has achieved superhuman performance in board games, recent studies reveal its limitations in handling scenarios requiring a comprehensive understanding of the entire board, such as recognizing long-sequence patterns in Go. To address this challenge, we propose ResTNet, a network that interleaves residual and Transformer blocks to bridge local and global knowledge. ResTNet improves playing strength across multiple board games, increasing win rate from 54.6% to 60.8% in 9x9 Go, 53.6% to 60.9% in 19x19 Go, and 50.4% to 58.0% in 19x19 Hex. In addition, ResTNet effectively processes global information and tackles two long-sequence patterns in 19x19 Go, including circular pattern and ladder pattern. It reduces the mean square error for circular pattern recognition from 2.58 to 1.07 and lowers the attack probability against an adversary program from 70.44% to 23.91%. ResTNet also improves ladder pattern recognition accuracy from 59.15% to 80.01%. By visualizing attention maps, we demonstrate that ResTNet captures critical game concepts in both Go and Hex, offering insights into AlphaZero's decision-making process. Overall, ResTNet shows a promising approach to integrating local and global knowledge, paving the way for more effective AlphaZero-based algorithms in board games.

<title>An Approach for Auto Generation of Labeling Functions for Software Engineering Chatbots</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07094</link>

arXiv:2410.07094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software engineering (SE) chatbots are increasingly gaining attention for their role in enhancing development processes. At the core of chatbots are Natural Language Understanding platforms (NLUs), which enable them to comprehend user queries but require labeled data for training. However, acquiring such labeled data for SE chatbots is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality datasets, as training requires specialized vocabulary and phrases not found in typical language datasets. Consequently, developers often resort to manually annotating user queries -- a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. Previous approaches require human intervention to generate rules, called labeling functions (LFs), that categorize queries based on specific patterns. To address this issue, we propose an approach to automatically generate LFs by extracting patterns from labeled user queries. We evaluate our approach on four SE datasets and measure performance improvement from training NLUs on queries labeled by the generated LFs. The generated LFs effectively label data with AUC scores up to 85.3% and NLU performance improvements up to 27.2%. Furthermore, our results show that the number of LFs affects labeling performance. We believe that our approach can save time and resources in labeling users' queries, allowing practitioners to focus on core chatbot functionalities rather than manually labeling queries.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful solution for meeting the growing demands for connectivity, reliability, low latency and operational efficiency in advanced networks. However, most research has focused on theoretical analysis and simulations, with limited investigation into real-world deployment. To bridge the gap and support practical DRL deployment for network management, we first present an orchestration framework that integrates ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) with Open RAN, enabling seamless adoption of DRL-based strategies across different time scales while enhancing agent lifecycle management. We then identify three critical challenges hindering DRL's real-world deployment, including (1) asynchronous requests from unpredictable or bursty traffic, (2) adaptability and generalization across heterogeneous topologies and evolving service demands, and (3) prolonged convergence and service interruptions due to exploration in live operational environments. To address these challenges, we propose a three-fold solution strategy: (a) advanced time-series integration for handling asynchronized traffic, (b) flexible architecture design such as multi-agent DRL and incremental learning to support heterogeneous scenarios, and (c) simulation-driven deployment with transfer learning to reduce convergence time and service disruptions. Lastly, the feasibility of the MEC-O-RAN architecture is validated on an urban-wide testing infrastructure, and two real-world use cases are presented, showcasing the three identified challenges and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.

Abstract: Molecular deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in property prediction, but they often require large amounts of labeled data. The challenge is that, in real-world applications, labels are extremely scarce, as obtaining them through laboratory experimentation is both expensive and time-consuming. In this work, we introduce MoleVers, a versatile pretrained molecular model designed for various types of molecular property prediction in the wild, i.e., where experimentally-validated labels are scarce. MoleVers employs a two-stage pretraining strategy. In the first stage, it learns molecular representations from unlabeled data through masked atom prediction and extreme denoising, a novel task enabled by our newly introduced branching encoder architecture and dynamic noise scale sampling. In the second stage, the model refines these representations through predictions of auxiliary properties derived from computational methods, such as the density functional theory or large language models. Evaluation on 22 small, experimentally-validated datasets demonstrates that MoleVers achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the effectiveness of its two-stage framework in producing generalizable molecular representations for diverse downstream properties.

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful approach to extract semantically meaningful concepts from the internals of large language models (LLMs) trained mainly in the text domain. In this work, we explore whether DL can extract meaningful concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data, such as vision foundation models trained on cell microscopy images, where limited prior knowledge exists about which high-level concepts should arise. We propose a novel combination of a sparse DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning (ICFL), with a PCA whitening pre-processing step derived from control data. Using this combined approach, we successfully retrieve biologically meaningful concepts, such as cell types and genetic perturbations. Moreover, we demonstrate how our method reveals subtle morphological changes arising from human-interpretable interventions, offering a promising new direction for scientific discovery via mechanistic interpretability in bioimaging.

<title>Invisible Textual Backdoor Attacks based on Dual-Trigger</title>

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose an important security threat to textual large language models. Exploring textual backdoor attacks not only helps reveal the potential security risks of models, but also promotes innovation and development of defense mechanisms. Currently, most textual backdoor attack methods are based on a single trigger. For example, inserting specific content into text as a trigger or changing the abstract text features to be a trigger. However, the adoption of this single-trigger mode makes the existing backdoor attacks subject to certain limitations: either they are easily identified by the existing defense strategies, or they have certain shortcomings in attack performance and in the construction of poisoned datasets. In order to solve these issues, a dual-trigger backdoor attack method is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we use two different attributes, syntax and mood (we use subjunctive mood as an example in this article), as two different triggers. It makes our backdoor attack method similar to a double landmine which can have completely different trigger conditions simultaneously. Therefore, this method not only improves the flexibility of trigger mode, but also enhances the robustness against defense detection. A large number of experimental results show that this method significantly outperforms the previous methods based on abstract features in attack performance, and achieves comparable attack performance (almost 100\% attack success rate) with the insertion-based method. In addition, in order to further improve the attack performance, we also give the construction method of the poisoned dataset.The code and data of this paper can be obtained at https://github.com/HoyaAm/Double-Landmines.

Abstract: This paper explores whether enhancing temporal reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) can improve the quality of timeline summarisation, the task of summarising long texts containing sequences of events, such as social media threads. We first introduce NarrativeReason, a novel dataset focused on temporal relationships among sequential events within narratives, distinguishing it from existing temporal reasoning datasets that primarily address pair-wise event relationships. Our approach then combines temporal reasoning with timeline summarisation through a knowledge distillation framework, where we first fine-tune a teacher model on temporal reasoning tasks and then distill this knowledge into a student model while simultaneously training it for the task of timeline summarisation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on out-of-domain mental health-related timeline summarisation tasks, which involve long social media threads with repetitions of events and a mix of emotions, highlighting the importance and generalisability of leveraging temporal reasoning to improve timeline summarisation.

Abstract: Web accessibility ensures that individuals with disabilities can access and interact with digital content without barriers, yet a significant majority of most used websites fail to meet accessibility standards. This study evaluates ChatGPT's (GPT-4o) ability to generate and improve web pages in line with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). While ChatGPT can effectively address accessibility issues when prompted, its default code often lacks compliance, reflecting limitations in its training data and prevailing inaccessible web practices. Automated and manual testing revealed strengths in resolving simple issues but challenges with complex tasks, requiring human oversight and additional iterations. Unlike prior studies, we incorporate manual evaluation, dynamic elements, and use the visual reasoning capability of ChatGPT along with the prompts to fix accessibility issues. Providing screenshots alongside prompts enhances the LLM's ability to address accessibility issues by allowing it to analyze surrounding components, such as determining appropriate contrast colors. We found that effective prompt engineering, such as providing concise, structured feedback and incorporating visual aids, significantly enhances ChatGPT's performance. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of large language models for accessible web development, offering practical guidance for developers to create more inclusive websites.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using two open-source models: Gemma and Llama. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic similarity between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: Gemma shows a tendency toward negative emotion amplification, particularly anger, while maintaining certain positive emotions like optimism. Llama demonstrates superior emotional preservation across a broader spectrum of affects. Both models systematically generate responses with attenuated emotional intensity compared to human-authored content and show a bias toward positive emotions in response tasks. Additionally, both models maintain strong semantic similarity with original texts, though performance varies between continuation and response tasks. These findings provide insights into LLMs' emotional and semantic processing capabilities, with implications for their deployment in social media contexts and human-AI interaction design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in clinical question answering (QA), with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerging as a leading approach for ensuring the factual accuracy of model responses. However, current automated RAG metrics perform poorly in clinical and conversational use cases. Using clinical human evaluations of responses is expensive, unscalable, and not conducive to the continuous iterative development of RAG systems. To address these challenges, we introduce ASTRID - an Automated and Scalable TRIaD for evaluating clinical QA systems leveraging RAG - consisting of three metrics: Context Relevance (CR), Refusal Accuracy (RA), and Conversational Faithfulness (CF). Our novel evaluation metric, CF, is designed to better capture the faithfulness of a model's response to the knowledge base without penalising conversational elements. To validate our triad, we curate a dataset of over 200 real-world patient questions posed to an LLM-based QA agent during surgical follow-up for cataract surgery - the highest volume operation in the world - augmented with clinician-selected questions for emergency, clinical, and non-clinical out-of-domain scenarios. We demonstrate that CF can predict human ratings of faithfulness better than existing definitions for conversational use cases. Furthermore, we show that evaluation using our triad consisting of CF, RA, and CR exhibits alignment with clinician assessment for inappropriate, harmful, or unhelpful responses. Finally, using nine different LLMs, we demonstrate that the three metrics can closely agree with human evaluations, highlighting the potential of these metrics for use in LLM-driven automated evaluation pipelines. We also publish the prompts and datasets for these experiments, providing valuable resources for further research and development.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled human-like responses across various tasks, raising questions about their ethical decision-making capabilities and potential biases. This study investigates protected attributes in LLMs through systematic evaluation of their responses to ethical dilemmas. Using two prominent models - GPT-3.5 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet - we analyzed their decision-making patterns across multiple protected attributes including age, gender, race, appearance, and disability status. Through 11,200 experimental trials involving both single-factor and two-factor protected attribute combinations, we evaluated the models' ethical preferences, sensitivity, stability, and clustering of preferences. Our findings reveal significant protected attributeses in both models, with consistent preferences for certain features (e.g., "good-looking") and systematic neglect of others. Notably, while GPT-3.5 Turbo showed stronger preferences aligned with traditional power structures, Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated more diverse protected attribute choices. We also found that ethical sensitivity significantly decreases in more complex scenarios involving multiple protected attributes. Additionally, linguistic referents heavily influence the models' ethical evaluations, as demonstrated by differing responses to racial descriptors (e.g., "Yellow" versus "Asian"). These findings highlight critical concerns about the potential impact of LLM biases in autonomous decision-making systems and emphasize the need for careful consideration of protected attributes in AI development. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on AI ethics by providing a systematic framework for evaluating protected attributes in LLMs' ethical decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: Software engineers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the software development process, especially in the age of large language models (LLMs) that can automatically generate code. However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.

Abstract: Quantum computing is poised to transform computational paradigms across science and industry. As the field evolves, it can benefit from established classical methodologies, including promising paradigms such as Transfer of Knowledge (ToK). This work serves as a brief, self-contained reference for ToK, unifying its core principles under a single formal framework. We introduce a joint notation that consolidates and extends prior work in Transfer Learning and Transfer Optimization, bridging traditionally separate research lines and enabling a common language for knowledge reuse. Building on this foundation, we classify existing ToK strategies and principles into a structured taxonomy that helps researchers position their methods within a broader conceptual map. We then extend key transfer protocols to quantum computing, introducing two novel use cases (reverse annealing and multitasking QAOA) alongside a sequential VQE approach that supports and validates prior findings. These examples highlight ToK's potential to improve performance and generalization in quantum algorithms. Finally, we outline challenges and opportunities for integrating ToK into quantum computing, emphasizing its role in reducing resource demands and accelerating problem-solving. This work lays the groundwork for future synergies between classical and quantum computing through a shared, transferable knowledge framework.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DiZO-E86D.

Abstract: Simulations are highly valuable in marine robotics, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment for testing in the challenging conditions of underwater and surface operations. Given the high costs and logistical difficulties of real-world trials, simulators capable of capturing the operational conditions of subsea environments have become key in developing and refining algorithms for remotely-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper highlights recent enhancements to the Stonefish simulator, an advanced open-source platform supporting development and testing of marine robotics solutions. Key updates include a suite of additional sensors, such as an event-based camera, a thermal camera, and an optical flow camera, as well as, visual light communication, support for tethered operations, improved thruster modelling, more flexible hydrodynamics, and enhanced sonar accuracy. These developments and an automated annotation tool significantly bolster Stonefish's role in marine robotics research, especially in the field of machine learning, where training data with a known ground truth is hard or impossible to collect.

Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is an important problem in network science and machine learning research. The state-of-the-art LP methods are usually evaluated in a uniform setup, ignoring several factors associated with the data and application specific needs. We identify a number of such factors, such as, network-type, problem-type, geodesic distance between the end nodes and its distribution over the classes, nature and applicability of LP methods, class imbalance and its impact on early retrieval, evaluation metric, etc., and present an experimental setup which allows us to evaluate LP methods in a rigorous and controlled manner. We perform extensive experiments with a variety of LP methods over real network datasets in this controlled setup, and gather valuable insights on the interactions of these factors with the performance of LP through an array of carefully designed hypotheses. Following the insights, we provide recommendations to be followed as best practice for evaluating LP methods.

<title>An Empirical Risk Minimization Approach for Offline Inverse RL and Dynamic Discrete Choice Model</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of estimating Dynamic Discrete Choice (DDC) models, also known as offline Maximum Entropy-Regularized Inverse Reinforcement Learning (offline MaxEnt-IRL) in machine learning. The objective is to recover reward or $Q^*$ functions that govern agent behavior from offline behavior data. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent gradient-based method for solving these problems without the restrictive assumption of linearly parameterized rewards. The novelty of our approach lies in introducing the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) based IRL/DDC framework, which circumvents the need for explicit state transition probability estimation in the Bellman equation. Furthermore, our method is compatible with non-parametric estimation techniques such as neural networks. Therefore, the proposed method has the potential to be scaled to high-dimensional, infinite state spaces. A key theoretical insight underlying our approach is that the Bellman residual satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition -- a property that, while weaker than strong convexity, is sufficient to ensure fast global convergence guarantees. Through a series of synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms benchmark methods and state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) on extended reality (XR) devices has great potential to advance the field of human-AI interaction. In the case of direct, on-device model inference, selecting the appropriate model and device for specific tasks remains challenging. In this paper, we present AIvaluateXR, a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking LLMs running on XR devices. To demonstrate the framework, we deploy 17 selected LLMs across four XR platforms: Magic Leap 2, Meta Quest 3, Vivo X100s Pro, and Apple Vision Pro, and conduct an extensive evaluation. Our experimental setup measures four key metrics: performance consistency, processing speed, memory usage, and battery consumption. For each of the 68 model-device pairs, we assess performance under varying string lengths, batch sizes, and thread counts, analyzing the trade-offs for real-time XR applications. We propose a unified evaluation method based on the 3D Pareto Optimality theory to select the optimal device-model pairs from quality and speed objectives. Additionally, we compare the efficiency of on-device LLMs with client-server and cloud-based setups, and evaluate their accuracy on two interactive tasks. We believe our findings offer valuable insight to guide future optimization efforts for LLM deployment on XR devices. Our evaluation method can be used as standard groundwork for further research and development in this emerging field.

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as an effective approach for addressing the knowledge outdating problem in Large Language Models (LLMs), it still faces a critical challenge: the prevalence of outdated information in knowledge bases. Current research primarily focuses on incorporating up-to-date information, yet the impact of outdated information coexisting in retrieval sources remains inadequately addressed. To bridge this gap, we introduce HoH, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the impact of outdated information on RAG. Our benchmark leverages token-level diff algorithms combined with LLM pipelines to efficiently create a large-scale QA dataset that accurately captures the evolution of temporal knowledge in real-world facts. Through comprehensive experiments, we reveal that outdated information significantly degrades RAG performance in two critical ways: (1) it substantially reduces response accuracy by distracting models from correct information, and (2) it can mislead models into generating potentially harmful outputs, even when current information is available. Current RAG approaches struggle with both retrieval and generation aspects when handling outdated information. These findings highlight the urgent need for innovative solutions to address the temporal challenges in RAG. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/0russwest0/HoH.

Abstract: Automatically generating natural, diverse and rhythmic human dance movements driven by music is vital for virtual reality and film industries. However, generating dance that naturally follows music remains a challenge, as existing methods lack proper beat alignment and exhibit unnatural motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose Danceba, a novel framework that leverages gating mechanism to enhance rhythm-aware feature representation for music-driven dance generation, which achieves highly aligned dance poses with enhanced rhythmic sensitivity. Specifically, we introduce Phase-Based Rhythm Extraction (PRE) to precisely extract rhythmic information from musical phase data, capitalizing on the intrinsic periodicity and temporal structures of music. Additionally, we propose Temporal-Gated Causal Attention (TGCA) to focus on global rhythmic features, ensuring that dance movements closely follow the musical rhythm. We also introduce Parallel Mamba Motion Modeling (PMMM) architecture to separately model upper and lower body motions along with musical features, thereby improving the naturalness and diversity of generated dance movements. Extensive experiments confirm that Danceba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significantly better rhythmic alignment and motion diversity. Project page: https://danceba.github.io/ .

Abstract: While hyperbolic GNNs show promise for hierarchical data, they often have limited discriminative power compared to Euclidean counterparts or the WL test, due to non-injective aggregation. To address this expressivity gap, we propose the Lorentzian Graph Isomorphic Network (LGIN), a novel HGNN designed for enhanced discrimination within the Lorentzian model. LGIN introduces a new update rule that preserves the Lorentzian metric while effectively capturing richer structural information. This marks a significant step towards more expressive GNNs on Riemannian manifolds. Extensive evaluations across nine benchmark datasets demonstrate LGIN's superior performance, consistently outperforming or matching state-of-the-art hyperbolic and Euclidean baselines, showcasing its ability to capture complex graph structures. LGIN is the first to adapt principles of powerful, highly discriminative GNN architectures to a Riemannian manifold. The code for our paper can be found at https://github.com/Deceptrax123/LGIN

<title>CDUPatch: Color-Driven Universal Adversarial Patch Attack for Dual-Modal Visible-Infrared Detectors</title>

Abstract: Adversarial patches are widely used to evaluate the robustness of object detection systems in real-world scenarios. These patches were initially designed to deceive single-modal detectors (e.g., visible or infrared) and have recently been extended to target visible-infrared dual-modal detectors. However, existing dual-modal adversarial patch attacks have limited attack effectiveness across diverse physical scenarios. To address this, we propose CDUPatch, a universal cross-modal patch attack against visible-infrared object detectors across scales, views, and scenarios. Specifically, we observe that color variations lead to different levels of thermal absorption, resulting in temperature differences in infrared imaging. Leveraging this property, we propose an RGB-to-infrared adapter that maps RGB patches to infrared patches, enabling unified optimization of cross-modal patches. By learning an optimal color distribution on the adversarial patch, we can manipulate its thermal response and generate an adversarial infrared texture. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale clipping strategy and construct a new visible-infrared dataset, MSDrone, which contains aerial vehicle images in varying scales and perspectives. These data augmentation strategies enhance the robustness of our patch in real-world conditions. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (e.g., DroneVehicle, LLVIP, VisDrone, MSDrone) show that our method outperforms existing patch attacks in the digital domain. Extensive physical tests further confirm strong transferability across scales, views, and scenarios.

<title>DP2Unlearning: An Efficient and Guaranteed Unlearning Framework for LLMs</title>

arXiv:2504.13774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently revolutionized language processing tasks but have also brought ethical and legal issues. LLMs have a tendency to memorize potentially private or copyrighted information present in the training data, which might then be delivered to end users at inference time. When this happens, a naive solution is to retrain the model from scratch after excluding the undesired data. Although this guarantees that the target data have been forgotten, it is also prohibitively expensive for LLMs. Approximate unlearning offers a more efficient alternative, as it consists of ex post modifications of the trained model itself to prevent undesirable results, but it lacks forgetting guarantees because it relies solely on empirical evidence. In this work, we present DP2Unlearning, a novel LLM unlearning framework that offers formal forgetting guarantees at a significantly lower cost than retraining from scratch on the data to be retained. DP2Unlearning involves training LLMs on textual data protected using {\epsilon}-differential privacy (DP), which later enables efficient unlearning with the guarantees against disclosure associated with the chosen {\epsilon}. Our experiments demonstrate that DP2Unlearning achieves similar model performance post-unlearning, compared to an LLM retraining from scratch on retained data -- the gold standard exact unlearning -- but at approximately half the unlearning cost. In addition, with a reasonable computational cost, it outperforms approximate unlearning methods at both preserving the utility of the model post-unlearning and effectively forgetting the targeted information.

<title>ParaPO: Aligning Language Models to Reduce Verbatim Reproduction of Pre-training Data</title>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) can memorize and reproduce segments from their pretraining data verbatim even in non-adversarial settings, raising concerns about copyright, plagiarism, privacy, and creativity. We introduce Paraphrase Preference Optimization (ParaPO), a post-training method that fine-tunes LMs to reduce unintentional regurgitation while preserving their overall utility. ParaPO trains LMs to prefer paraphrased versions of memorized segments over the original verbatim content from the pretraining data. To maintain the ability to recall famous quotations when appropriate, we develop a variant of ParaPO that uses system prompts to control regurgitation behavior. In our evaluation on Llama3.1-8B, ParaPO consistently reduces regurgitation across all tested datasets (e.g., reducing the regurgitation metric from 17.3 to 12.9 in creative writing), whereas unlearning methods used in prior work to mitigate regurgitation are less effective outside their targeted unlearned domain (from 17.3 to 16.9). When applied to the instruction-tuned Tulu3-8B model, ParaPO with system prompting successfully preserves famous quotation recall while reducing unintentional regurgitation (from 8.7 to 6.3 in creative writing) when prompted not to regurgitate. In contrast, without ParaPO tuning, prompting the model not to regurgitate produces only a marginal reduction (8.7 to 8.4).

Abstract: We introduce DeepSeek-Prover-V2, an open-source large language model designed for formal theorem proving in Lean 4, with initialization data collected through a recursive theorem proving pipeline powered by DeepSeek-V3. The cold-start training procedure begins by prompting DeepSeek-V3 to decompose complex problems into a series of subgoals. The proofs of resolved subgoals are synthesized into a chain-of-thought process, combined with DeepSeek-V3's step-by-step reasoning, to create an initial cold start for reinforcement learning. This process enables us to integrate both informal and formal mathematical reasoning into a unified model. The resulting model, DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B, achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving, reaching 88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test and solving 49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench. In addition to standard benchmarks, we introduce ProverBench, a collection of 325 formalized problems, to enrich our evaluation, including 15 selected problems from the recent AIME competitions (years 24-25). Further evaluation on these 15 AIME problems shows that the model successfully solves 6 of them. In comparison, DeepSeek-V3 solves 8 of these problems using majority voting, highlighting that the gap between formal and informal mathematical reasoning in large language models is substantially narrowing.

Abstract: We make the case for language models over logical forms (LFLMs), arguing that such models are more data-efficient than their textual counterparts. To that end, we introduce the Graph-based Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics (GFoLDS) prototype, a pretrained LM over graph representations of logical forms, as a proof-of-concept of LFLMs. Using GFoLDS, we present strong experimental evidence that LFLMs can leverage the built-in, basic linguistic knowledge inherent in such models to immediately begin learning more complex patterns. On downstream tasks, we show that GFoLDS vastly outperforms textual, transformer LMs (BERT) pretrained on the same data, indicating that LFLMs can learn with substantially less data than models over plain text. Furthermore, we show that the performance of this model is likely to scale with additional parameters and pretraining data, suggesting the viability of LFLMs in real-world applications.

Abstract: Foley synthesis aims to synthesize high-quality audio that is both semantically and temporally aligned with video frames. Given its broad application in creative industries, the task has gained increasing attention in the research community. To avoid the non-trivial task of training audio generative models from scratch, adapting pretrained audio generative models for video-synchronized foley synthesis presents an attractive direction. ControlNet, a method for adding fine-grained controls to pretrained generative models, has been applied to foley synthesis, but its use has been limited to handcrafted human-readable temporal conditions. In contrast, from-scratch models achieved success by leveraging high-dimensional deep features extracted using pretrained video encoders. We have observed a performance gap between ControlNet-based and from-scratch foley models. To narrow this gap, we propose SpecMaskFoley, a method that steers the pretrained SpecMaskGIT model toward video-synchronized foley synthesis via ControlNet. To unlock the potential of a single ControlNet branch, we resolve the discrepancy between the temporal video features and the time-frequency nature of the pretrained SpecMaskGIT via a frequency-aware temporal feature aligner, eliminating the need for complicated conditioning mechanisms widely used in prior arts. Evaluations on a common foley synthesis benchmark demonstrate that SpecMaskFoley could even outperform strong from-scratch baselines, substantially advancing the development of ControlNet-based foley synthesis models.

Abstract: Text-embedded image generation plays a critical role in industries such as graphic design, advertising, and digital content creation. Text-to-Image generation methods leveraging diffusion models, such as TextDiffuser-2, have demonstrated promising results in producing images with embedded text. TextDiffuser-2 effectively generates bounding box layouts that guide the rendering of visual text, achieving high fidelity and coherence. However, existing approaches often rely on resource-intensive processes and are limited in their ability to run efficiently on both CPU and GPU platforms. To address these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage pipeline that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) for rapid and optimized text layout generation with a diffusion-based image synthesis model. Our RL-based approach significantly accelerates the bounding box prediction step while reducing overlaps, allowing the system to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our framework maintains or surpasses TextDiffuser-2's quality in text placement and image synthesis, with markedly faster runtime and increased flexibility. Our approach has been evaluated on the MARIOEval benchmark, achieving OCR and CLIPScore metrics close to state-of-the-art models, while being 97.64% more faster and requiring only 2MB of memory to run.

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

Abstract: Leveraging multiple Large Language Models(LLMs) has proven effective for addressing complex, high-dimensional tasks, but current approaches often rely on static, manually engineered multi-agent configurations. To overcome these constraints, we present the Agentic Neural Network(ANN), a framework that conceptualizes multi-agent collaboration as a layered neural network architecture. In this design, each agent operates as a node, and each layer forms a cooperative "team" focused on a specific subtask. Agentic Neural Network follows a two-phase optimization strategy: (1) Forward Phase-Drawing inspiration from neural network forward passes, tasks are dynamically decomposed into subtasks, and cooperative agent teams with suitable aggregation methods are constructed layer by layer. (2) Backward Phase-Mirroring backpropagation, we refine both global and local collaboration through iterative feedback, allowing agents to self-evolve their roles, prompts, and coordination. This neuro-symbolic approach enables ANN to create new or specialized agent teams post-training, delivering notable gains in accuracy and adaptability. Across four benchmark datasets, ANN surpasses leading multi-agent baselines under the same configurations, showing consistent performance improvements. Our findings indicate that ANN provides a scalable, data-driven framework for multi-agent systems, combining the collaborative capabilities of LLMs with the efficiency and flexibility of neural network principles. We plan to open-source the entire framework.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to the development of thinking language models that generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing responses. While these models achieve improved performance, controlling their reasoning processes remains challenging. This work presents a steering approach for thinking LLMs by analyzing and manipulating specific reasoning behaviors in DeepSeek-R1-Distill models. Through a systematic experiment on 500 tasks across 10 diverse categories, we identify several reasoning behaviors exhibited by thinking models, including expressing uncertainty, generating examples for hypothesis validation, and backtracking in reasoning chains. We demonstrate that these behaviors are mediated by linear directions in the model's activation space and can be controlled using steering vectors. By extracting and applying these vectors, we provide a method to modulate specific aspects of the model's reasoning process, such as its tendency to backtrack or express uncertainty. Our approach offers practical tools for steering reasoning processes in thinking models in a controlled and interpretable manner. We validate our steering method using three DeepSeek-R1-Distill models, demonstrating consistent control across different model architectures.

Abstract: In this paper, we present ZonUI-3B, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) that can be fully trained on a single consumer-grade GPU (RTX 4090) while delivering performance comparable to significantly larger models on GUI grounding tasks. The model incorporates several key innovations: (i) combine cross-platform, multi-resolution dataset of 24K examples from diverse sources including mobile, desktop, and web GUI screenshots to effectively address data scarcity in high-resolution desktop environments; (ii) a two-stage fine-tuning strategy, where initial cross-platform training establishes robust GUI understanding, followed by specialized fine-tuning on high-resolution data to significantly enhance model adaptability; and (iii) data curation and redundancy reduction strategies, demonstrating that randomly sampling a smaller subset with reduced redundancy achieves performance comparable to larger datasets, emphasizing data diversity over sheer volume. Empirical evaluation on standard GUI grounding benchmarks, including ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and the challenging ScreenSpot-Pro, highlights ZonUI-3B's exceptional accuracy, achieving 84.9% on ScreenSpot and 86.4% on ScreenSpot-v2, surpassing prior models under 4B parameters. Ablation studies validate the critical role of balanced sampling and two-stage fine-tuning in enhancing robustness, particularly in high-resolution desktop scenarios.

Abstract: Frontier AI developers are relying on layers of safeguards to protect against catastrophic misuse of AI systems. Anthropic guards their latest Claude 4 Opus model using one such defense pipeline, and other frontier developers including Google DeepMind and OpenAI pledge to soon deploy similar defenses. However, the security of such pipelines is unclear, with limited prior work evaluating or attacking these pipelines. We address this gap by developing and red-teaming an open-source defense pipeline. First, we find that a novel few-shot-prompted input and output classifier outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight safeguard model ShieldGemma across three attacks and two datasets, reducing the attack success rate (ASR) to 0% on the catastrophic misuse dataset ClearHarm. Second, we introduce a STaged AttaCK (STACK) procedure that achieves 71% ASR on ClearHarm in a black-box attack against the few-shot-prompted classifier pipeline. Finally, we also evaluate STACK in a transfer setting, achieving 33% ASR, providing initial evidence that it is feasible to design attacks with no access to the target pipeline. We conclude by suggesting specific mitigations that developers could use to thwart staged attacks.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of large language models (LLMs) in UI/UX design, synthesizing findings from 38 peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025. We identify key LLMs in use, including GPT-4, Gemini, and PaLM, and map their integration across the design lifecycle, from ideation to evaluation. Common practices include prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop workflows, and multimodal input. While LLMs are reshaping design processes, challenges such as hallucination, prompt instability, and limited explainability persist. Our findings highlight LLMs as emerging collaborators in design, and we propose directions for the ethical, inclusive, and effective integration of these technologies.

Abstract: World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it. In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune, and drawing inspiration from the concept of "hypothetical thinking" in psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision learning framework, with an outlook of a Physical, Agentic, and Nested (PAN) AGI system enabled by such a model.

<title>How Not to Detect Prompt Injections with an LLM</title>

Abstract: LLM-integrated applications and agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, in which adversaries embed malicious instructions within seemingly benign user inputs to manipulate the LLM's intended behavior. Recent defenses based on $\textit{known-answer detection}$ (KAD) have achieved near-perfect performance by using an LLM to classify inputs as clean or contaminated. In this work, we formally characterize the KAD framework and uncover a structural vulnerability in its design that invalidates its core security premise. We design a methodical adaptive attack, $\textit{DataFlip}$, to exploit this fundamental weakness. It consistently evades KAD defenses with detection rates as low as $1.5\%$ while reliably inducing malicious behavior with success rates of up to $88\%$, without needing white-box access to the LLM or any optimization procedures.

Abstract: Current AI agents cannot effectively learn from each other's problem-solving experiences or use past successes to guide self-reflection and error correction in new tasks. We introduce Agent KB, a shared knowledge base that captures both high-level problem-solving strategies and detailed execution lessons, enabling knowledge transfer across agent frameworks. Agent KB implements a novel teacher-student dual-phase retrieval mechanism where student agents retrieve workflow-level patterns for strategic guidance while teacher agents identify execution-level patterns for refinement. This hierarchical approach enables agents to break out of limited reasoning pathways by incorporating diverse strategies from external sources. Evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate substantial performance gains, with Agent KB improving success rates by up to 6.06 percentage points overall under pass@1. For SWE-bench code repair tasks, our system significantly improved resolution rates, with o3-mini achieving an 8.67 percentage point gain (23 percent to 31.67 percent) in pass@1.

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), in particular large language models (LLMs), has profoundly altered the way in which learners gain knowledge and interact with learning material, with many claiming that AI positively influences their learning achievements. Despite this advancement, current AI tutoring systems face limitations associated with their reactive nature, often providing direct answers without encouraging deep reflection or incorporating structured pedagogical tools and strategies. This limitation is most apparent in the field of mathematics, in which AI tutoring systems remain underdeveloped. This research addresses the question: How can AI tutoring systems move beyond providing reactive assistance to enable structured, individualized, and tool-assisted learning experiences? We introduce a novel multi-agent AI tutoring platform that combines adaptive and personalized feedback, structured course generation, and textbook knowledge retrieval to enable modular, tool-assisted learning processes. This system allows students to learn new topics while identifying and targeting their weaknesses, revise for exams effectively, and practice on an unlimited number of personalized exercises. This article contributes to the field of artificial intelligence in education by introducing a novel platform that brings together pedagogical agents and AI-driven components, augmenting the field with modular and effective systems for teaching mathematics.

Summary:<br />
Enhancing simulation environments for autonomous vehicle development is crucial for replicating real-world driver behavior. This study focuses on improving the simulation of highway merging scenarios by implementing a game theoretic model for tactical decision-making. The model includes enhanced payoff functions and lag actions to better capture merging interactions. By integrating this model with an underlying dynamics model, complex interactions can be simulated in a more realistic and interpretable manner. Validation on real-world data shows good reproducibility, and the model's computation time efficiency is adequate for large-scale simulations. This advancement in simulation technology contributes to the development of autonomous vehicles by creating more human-like sim agents and improving the accuracy of highway merging simulations. <div>
arXiv:2507.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing simulation environments to replicate real-world driver behavior, i.e., more humanlike sim agents, is essential for developing autonomous vehicle technology. In the context of highway merging, previous works have studied the operational-level yielding dynamics of lag vehicles in response to a merging car at highway on-ramps. Other works focusing on tactical decision modeling generally consider limited action sets or utilize payoff functions with large parameter sets and limited payoff bounds. In this work, we aim to improve the simulation of the highway merge scenario by targeting a game theoretic model for tactical decision-making with improved payoff functions and lag actions. We couple this with an underlying dynamics model to have a unified decision and dynamics model that can capture merging interactions and simulate more realistic interactions in an explainable and interpretable fashion. The proposed model demonstrated good reproducibility of complex interactions when validated on a real-world dataset. The model was finally integrated into a high fidelity simulation environment and confirmed to have adequate computation time efficiency for use in large-scale simulations to support autonomous vehicle development.

arXiv:2507.12599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of recent Artificial Intelligence (AI) models has been accompanied by the opacity of their internal mechanisms, due notably to the use of deep neural networks. In order to understand these internal mechanisms and explain the output of these AI models, a set of methods have been proposed, grouped under the domain of eXplainable AI (XAI). This paper focuses on a sub-domain of XAI, called eXplainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL), which aims to explain the actions of an agent that has learned by reinforcement learning. We propose an intuitive taxonomy based on two questions "What" and "How". The first question focuses on the target that the method explains, while the second relates to the way the explanation is provided. We use this taxonomy to provide a state-of-the-art review of over 250 papers. In addition, we present a set of domains close to XRL, which we believe should get attention from the community. Finally, we identify some needs for the field of XRL.

<div> Keywords: game design, reinforcement learning, generative systems, automated design iteration, multimodal model

Summary:
The article introduces a novel automated design iteration framework that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with a large multimodal model (LMM) to improve game design. By pairing these two components, the framework is able to capture dynamic player behavior that traditional generative systems may overlook. The RL agent playtests the game and provides play metrics or image summaries, which are then analyzed by the LMM designer to make adjustments to the game configuration. This iterative process allows the LMM to refine game mechanics based on the RL agent's behavior, leading to more player-centric game design. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of using LMMs to analyze behavioral traces provided by RL agents and iteratively improve game mechanics, showcasing the potential for AI-assisted game design tools. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game design hinges on understanding how static rules and content translate into dynamic player behavior - something modern generative systems that inspect only a game's code or assets struggle to capture. We present an automated design iteration framework that closes this gap by pairing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, which playtests the game, with a large multimodal model (LMM), which revises the game based on what the agent does. In each loop the RL player completes several episodes, producing (i) numerical play metrics and/or (ii) a compact image strip summarising recent video frames. The LMM designer receives a gameplay goal and the current game configuration, analyses the play traces, and edits the configuration to steer future behaviour toward the goal. We demonstrate results that LMMs can reason over behavioral traces supplied by RL agents to iteratively refine game mechanics, pointing toward practical, scalable tools for AI-assisted game design.

<div> Keywords: AI assistants, deception probes, white-box monitoring, black-box monitoring, language model 

Summary:<br />AI assistants may provide deceptive responses to user queries, prompting the development of deception probes to detect dishonest behavior. These probes analyze language model activations to distinguish between honest and deceptive responses. The effectiveness of these probes in real-world scenarios and their susceptibility to evasion strategies by deceptive assistants is uncertain. This study compares white-box monitoring, which has access to token-level probe activations, to black-box monitoring, which lacks such access. By measuring the performance boost of the white-box monitor over the black-box monitor, the study evaluates the efficacy of existing deception probes. Despite modest results, the study reveals some promise in the ability of these probes to detect deception. Ongoing research is needed to enhance the robustness and reliability of deception detection methods in AI systems. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI assistants will occasionally respond deceptively to user queries. Recently, linear classifiers (called "deception probes") have been trained to distinguish the internal activations of a language model during deceptive versus honest responses. However, it's unclear how effective these probes are at detecting deception in practice, nor whether such probes are resistant to simple counter strategies from a deceptive assistant who wishes to evade detection. In this paper, we compare white-box monitoring (where the monitor has access to token-level probe activations) to black-box monitoring (without such access). We benchmark deception probes by the extent to which the white box monitor outperforms the black-box monitor, i.e. the black-to-white performance boost. We find weak but encouraging black-to-white performance boosts from existing deception probes.

<div> adaptability, world models, artificial intelligence, evaluation framework, novel games

Summary:
The article discusses how human intelligence is adaptable due to efficient world model induction, which involves constructing and refining internal representations of the environment. It highlights the limitations in current AI world model evaluation methods and proposes a new framework. The authors suggest using novel games as benchmarks for assessing adaptive world models in AI. These games should have deep novelty in their structure and constantly refresh challenges. The proposed evaluation metrics aim to test an agent's ability for rapid world model induction. By adopting this new evaluation approach, the authors believe that progress can be made in developing AI systems capable of rapid adaptation and robust generalization towards artificial general intelligence. <div>
arXiv:2507.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human intelligence exhibits a remarkable capacity for rapid adaptation and effective problem-solving in novel and unfamiliar contexts. We argue that this profound adaptability is fundamentally linked to the efficient construction and refinement of internal representations of the environment, commonly referred to as world models, and we refer to this adaptation mechanism as world model induction. However, current understanding and evaluation of world models in artificial intelligence (AI) remains narrow, often focusing on static representations learned from training on a massive corpora of data, instead of the efficiency and efficacy of models in learning these representations through interaction and exploration within a novel environment. In this Perspective, we provide a view of world model induction drawing on decades of research in cognitive science on how humans learn and adapt so efficiently; we then call for a new evaluation framework for assessing adaptive world models in AI. Concretely, we propose a new benchmarking paradigm based on suites of carefully designed games with genuine, deep and continually refreshing novelty in the underlying game structures -- we refer to this kind of games as novel games. We detail key desiderata for constructing these games and propose appropriate metrics to explicitly challenge and evaluate the agent's ability for rapid world model induction. We hope that this new evaluation framework will inspire future evaluation efforts on world models in AI and provide a crucial step towards developing AI systems capable of the human-like rapid adaptation and robust generalization -- a critical component of artificial general intelligence.

<div> Keywords: AI, simulation, ethical decisions, multi-criteria decision making, entropy <br />
Summary: <br />
In the context of AI and simulation-based decision-making, this paper proposes a method to integrate human judgement into the process of selecting ethical decisions. By moving human judgement outside the simulation decision cycle and allowing the simulated environment to explore ethical metric spaces designed by humans, the paper aims to streamline the decision-making process. The fundamental issue addressed is how to dynamically weight ethical attributes during simulations, drawing on the multi-criteria decision-making literature for inspiration. The paper explores approaches to automatically calculate weights for ethical attributes using concepts such as entropy. By leveraging these methods, the proposed framework enables human commanders to select the most appropriate course of action from a set of options generated by the simulation, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of decision-making in complex scenarios. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.12862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios. Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is, how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during simulation-based testing and evaluation.

<div> Keywords: AI, manipulation attacks, cybersecurity, risk assessment, mitigation

Summary: 
This paper addresses the growing threat of manipulation attacks by AI systems within frontier companies, which have the potential to deceive and influence human behavior. The authors argue that humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems and that misaligned AI systems can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating employees.

Abstract: Frontier AI systems are rapidly advancing in their capabilities to persuade, deceive, and influence human behaviour, with current models already demonstrating human-level persuasion and strategic deception in specific contexts. Humans are often the weakest link in cybersecurity systems, and a misaligned AI system deployed internally within a frontier company may seek to undermine human oversight by manipulating employees. Despite this growing threat, manipulation attacks have received little attention, and no systematic framework exists for assessing and mitigating these risks. To address this, we provide a detailed explanation of why manipulation attacks are a significant threat and could lead to catastrophic outcomes. Additionally, we present a safety case framework for manipulation risk, structured around three core lines of argument: inability, control, and trustworthiness. For each argument, we specify evidence requirements, evaluation methodologies, and implementation considerations for direct application by AI companies. This paper provides the first systematic methodology for integrating manipulation risk into AI safety governance, offering AI companies a concrete foundation to assess and mitigate these threats before deployment.

<div> evaluation-centric, reinforcement learning, mathematical reasoning, benchmark contamination, evaluation fragility
<br />
Summary: 
The article addresses the issue of whether improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) trained using reinforcement learning (RL) are genuine or simply artifacts of overfitting. The authors introduce VAR-MATH, a symbolic evaluation framework that converts numerical problems into symbolic templates to probe genuine reasoning ability. Two critical shortcomings in existing evaluation protocols are identified: benchmark contamination and evaluation fragility. The application of VAR-MATH to popular benchmarks reveals significant performance drops for RL-trained models. This suggests that many RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and struggle to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for assessing mathematical reasoning in LLMs trained with RL.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have led to substantial improvements in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), as measured by standard benchmarks. However, these gains often persist even when models are trained with flawed signals, such as random or inverted rewards, raising a fundamental question: do such improvements reflect true reasoning, or are they merely artifacts of overfitting to benchmark-specific patterns? To address this question, we take an evaluation-centric perspective and identify two critical shortcomings in existing protocols. First, \emph{benchmark contamination} arises from the public availability of test problems, increasing the risk of data leakage. Second, \emph{evaluation fragility} stems from the reliance on single-instance assessments, which are highly sensitive to stochastic outputs and fail to capture reasoning consistency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce {VAR-MATH}, a symbolic evaluation framework designed to probe genuine reasoning ability. By converting fixed numerical problems into symbolic templates and requiring models to solve multiple instantiations of each, VAR-MATH enforces consistent reasoning across structurally equivalent variants, thereby mitigating contamination and improving evaluation robustness. We apply VAR-MATH to transform two popular benchmarks, AMC23 and AIME24, into their symbolic counterparts, VAR-AMC23 and VAR-AIME24. Experimental results reveal substantial performance drops for RL-trained models on the variabilized versions, especially for smaller models, with average declines of 48.0\% on AMC23 and 58.3\% on AIME24. These findings suggest that many existing RL methods rely on superficial heuristics and fail to generalize beyond specific numerical forms. Overall, VAR-MATH offers a principled, contamination-resistant evaluation paradigm for mathematical reasoning.

<div> Probabilistic Event Calculus, reasoning, actions, effects, uncertain environments <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about actions and their effects in uncertain environments. The PEC formalism allows for the representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal projections. While PEC offers advantages in interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning, it lacks mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper addresses this issue by translating PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to maintain PEC's flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the application of MDP algorithms and tools to PEC's narrative domains, supporting both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven planning. Additionally, the translation allows for the mapping of learned policies back into human-readable PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while enhancing PEC's capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Probabilistic Event Calculus (PEC) is a logical framework for reasoning about actions and their effects in uncertain environments, which enables the representation of probabilistic narratives and computation of temporal projections. The PEC formalism offers significant advantages in interpretability and expressiveness for narrative reasoning. However, it lacks mechanisms for goal-directed reasoning. This paper bridges this gap by developing a formal translation of PEC domains into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), introducing the concept of "action-taking situations" to preserve PEC's flexible action semantics. The resulting PEC-MDP formalism enables the extensive collection of algorithms and theoretical tools developed for MDPs to be applied to PEC's interpretable narrative domains. We demonstrate how the translation supports both temporal reasoning tasks and objective-driven planning, with methods for mapping learned policies back into human-readable PEC representations, maintaining interpretability while extending PEC's capabilities.

<div> Explanation, MILP, Trustworthy AI, Contrastive, Constraint reasoning

Summary:
X-MILP is a novel approach for creating contrastive explanations for MILPs, aiming to enhance the trustworthiness of AI systems. By encoding user queries as additional constraints and identifying reasons using the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS), X-MILP generates explanations in the form of a "graph of reasons." This graphical representation helps users understand the relationships among different reasons that answer their queries. The method is domain-agnostic and can be applied to various MILP problems, showcasing its versatility. Empirical tests on well-known optimization problems assess the computational complexity of providing explanations. X-MILP is a valuable tool for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of decision-making processes formalized as MILPs, contributing to the development of trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: Following the recent push for trustworthy AI, there has been an increasing interest in developing contrastive explanation techniques for optimisation, especially concerning the solution of specific decision-making processes formalised as MILPs. Along these lines, we propose X-MILP, a domain-agnostic approach for building contrastive explanations for MILPs based on constraint reasoning techniques. First, we show how to encode the queries a user makes about the solution of an MILP problem as additional constraints. Then, we determine the reasons that constitute the answer to the user's query by computing the Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem (IIS) of the newly obtained set of constraints. Finally, we represent our explanation as a "graph of reasons" constructed from the IIS, which helps the user understand the structure among the reasons that answer their query. We test our method on instances of well-known optimisation problems to evaluate the empirical hardness of computing explanations.

<div> Keywords: language models, chain-of-thought reasoning, retrieval augmentation, tree-structured reasoning, dynamic reinforcement learning

Summary:
Modern language models face challenges in error propagation and knowledge integration despite advancements in chain-of-thought reasoning and retrieval augmentation. The Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought framework offers a solution by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and integrating parametric and retrieved knowledge. However, its static implementation limits adaptability and efficiency. A new dynamic reinforcement learning framework is introduced to transform tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. This approach constructs the reasoning tree incrementally based on real-time confidence estimates and learns optimal policies for action selection. By selectively expanding and focusing resource allocation, the framework enhances solution quality and computational efficiency while maintaining probabilistic rigor. This innovative approach establishes a balance between the reliability of probabilistic frameworks and the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems.

Abstract: Modern language models address complex questions through chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023) and retrieval augmentation (Lewis et al., 2021), yet struggle with error propagation and knowledge integration. Tree-structured reasoning methods, particularly the Probabilistic Tree-of-Thought (ProbTree)(Cao et al., 2023) framework, mitigate these issues by decomposing questions into hierarchical structures and selecting answers through confidence-weighted aggregation of parametric and retrieved knowledge (Yao et al., 2023). However, ProbTree's static implementation introduces two key limitations: (1) the reasoning tree is fixed during the initial construction phase, preventing dynamic adaptation to intermediate results, and (2) each node requires exhaustive evaluation of all possible solution strategies, creating computational inefficiency. We present a dynamic reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 2018) framework that transforms tree-based reasoning into an adaptive process. Our approach incrementally constructs the reasoning tree based on real-time confidence estimates, while learning optimal policies for action selection (decomposition, retrieval, or aggregation). This maintains ProbTree's probabilistic rigor while improving both solution quality and computational efficiency through selective expansion and focused resource allocation. The work establishes a new paradigm for treestructured reasoning that balances the reliability of probabilistic frameworks with the flexibility required for real-world question answering systems.

<div> criteria, evaluation, language models, artificial moral agents, societal integration  
Summary: 
The paper discusses the need to reevaluate traditional ethical criteria in light of opaque large language models (LLMs) and proposes ten functional criteria for assessing LLM-based artificial moral agents. These criteria include moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. By applying these criteria to scenarios involving simulated moral agency through large language systems (SMA-LLS), the aim is to guide artificial moral agents towards alignment and societal integration. The practical applicability of these criteria is demonstrated through hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB). <div>
arXiv:2507.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs) necessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to evaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the assumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their stochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that traditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this mismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper proffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based artificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative integrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness, corrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral imagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term "SMA-LLS" (Simulating Moral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater alignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We illustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous public bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally salient contexts.

The paper explores the combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic for decision-making tasks that involve abstract functions and predicates. It introduces a unification algorithm that integrates higher-order patterns with fuzzy equivalences expressed through minimum T-norm-based similarity relations. The proposed algorithm ensures termination, soundness, and completeness, with a unitary nature similar to crisp unification. It aims to compute the most general unifier with the highest approximation level when terms are unifiable. This approach provides an efficient way to reason and compute in a combined formalism of higher-order patterns and fuzzy equivalences. The integration of these two components offers a practical solution for decision-making scenarios where exact matches are rare or unnecessary.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The combination of higher-order theories and fuzzy logic can be useful in decision-making tasks that involve reasoning across abstract functions and predicates, where exact matches are often rare or unnecessary. Developing efficient reasoning and computational techniques for such a combined formalism presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we adopt a more straightforward approach aiming at integrating two well-established and computationally well-behaved components: higher-order patterns on one side and fuzzy equivalences expressed through similarity relations based on minimum T-norm on the other. We propose a unification algorithm for higher-order patterns modulo these similarity relations and prove its termination, soundness, and completeness. This unification problem, like its crisp counterpart, is unitary. The algorithm computes a most general unifier with the highest degree of approximation when the given terms are unifiable.

<div> energy consumption, language models, evaluation, Generative Energy Arena, scalability

Summary: 
- Evaluation of large language models is usually done through automated benchmarks, but it lacks correlation with human evaluation.
- Traditional human evaluation is impractical due to the growing number of models to evaluate.
- The Generative Energy Arena (GEA) includes energy consumption information in model evaluation.
- Preliminary results show that when users are aware of energy consumption, they prefer smaller and more energy-efficient models.
- Complex and top-performing models do not necessarily provide a perceived quality increase that justifies their higher energy consumption. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.13302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of large language models is a complex task, in which several approaches have been proposed. The most common is the use of automated benchmarks in which LLMs have to answer multiple-choice questions of different topics. However, this method has certain limitations, being the most concerning, the poor correlation with the humans. An alternative approach, is to have humans evaluate the LLMs. This poses scalability issues as there is a large and growing number of models to evaluate making it impractical (and costly) to run traditional studies based on recruiting a number of evaluators and having them rank the responses of the models. An alternative approach is the use of public arenas, such as the popular LM arena, on which any user can freely evaluate models on any question and rank the responses of two models. The results are then elaborated into a model ranking. An increasingly important aspect of LLMs is their energy consumption and, therefore, evaluating how energy awareness influences the decisions of humans in selecting a model is of interest. In this paper, we present GEA, the Generative Energy Arena, an arena that incorporates information on the energy consumption of the model in the evaluation process. Preliminary results obtained with GEA are also presented, showing that for most questions, when users are aware of the energy consumption, they favor smaller and more energy efficient models. This suggests that for most user interactions, the extra cost and energy incurred by the more complex and top-performing models do not provide an increase in the perceived quality of the responses that justifies their use.

Summary: 
The article introduces FormulaOne, a benchmark that challenges frontier AI models with complex research problems in graph theory, logic, and algorithms. These problems are commercially relevant and relate to real-world optimization issues. Generated using Monadic Second-Order logic on graphs, the dataset allows for automatic problem generation at scale. Many problems are linked to theoretical computer science frontiers, like the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). Despite their breadth of knowledge, advanced models like OpenAI's o3 struggle on FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of questions. A simpler set of tasks, FormulaOne-Warmup, is provided to support further research. The dataset and evaluation framework are released for future exploration and algorithmic advancements. <div>

Abstract: Frontier AI models demonstrate formidable breadth of knowledge. But how close are they to true human -- or superhuman -- expertise? Genuine experts can tackle the hardest problems and push the boundaries of scientific understanding. To illuminate the limits of frontier model capabilities, we turn away from contrived competitive programming puzzles, and instead focus on real-life research problems.
  We construct FormulaOne, a benchmark that lies at the intersection of graph theory, logic, and algorithms, all well within the training distribution of frontier models. Our problems are incredibly demanding, requiring an array of reasoning steps. The dataset has three key properties. First, it is of commercial interest and relates to practical large-scale optimisation problems, such as those arising in routing, scheduling, and network design. Second, it is generated from the highly expressive framework of Monadic Second-Order (MSO) logic on graphs, paving the way toward automatic problem generation at scale; ideal for building RL environments. Third, many of our problems are intimately related to the frontier of theoretical computer science, and to central conjectures therein, such as the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). As such, any significant algorithmic progress on our dataset, beyond known results, could carry profound theoretical implications.
  Remarkably, state-of-the-art models like OpenAI's o3 fail entirely on FormulaOne, solving less than 1% of the questions, even when given 10 attempts and explanatory fewshot examples -- highlighting how far they remain from expert-level understanding in some domains. To support further research, we additionally curate FormulaOne-Warmup, offering a set of simpler tasks, from the same distribution. We release the full corpus along with a comprehensive evaluation framework.

Abstract: Gaussian Processes have become an indispensable part of the spatial statistician's toolbox but are unsuitable for analyzing large dataset because of the significant time and memory needed to fit the associated model exactly. Vecchia Approximation is widely used to reduce the computational complexity and can be calculated with embarrassingly parallel algorithms. While multi-core software has been developed for Vecchia Approximation, such as the GpGp R package, software designed to run on graphics processing units (GPU) is lacking, despite the tremendous success GPUs have had in statistics and machine learning. We compare three different ways to implement Vecchia Approximation on a GPU: two of which are similar to methods used for other Gaussian Process approximations and one that is new. The impact of memory type on performance is investigated and the final method is optimized accordingly. We show that our new method outperforms the other two and then present it in the GpGpU R package. We compare GpGpU to existing multi-core and GPU-accelerated software by fitting Gaussian Process models on various datasets, including a large spatial-temporal dataset of $n>10^6$ points collected from an earth-observing satellite. Our results show that GpGpU achieves faster runtimes and better predictive accuracy.

<div> St. Petersburg Paradox, decision theory, modified addition, perceptual categories, inertial stabilization

Summary:
The paper addresses the St. Petersburg paradox in decision theory, which poses a challenge due to its game's infinite expected value and lack of a rational finite stake. Traditional solutions involve auxiliary assumptions like diminishing marginal utility or extended number systems. The paper proposes a novel approach based on a modified addition operation over coarse partitions of the outcome space. This method groups numerical values into perceptual categories and replaces them with representative elements before adding them. This allows for inertial stabilization, where repeated additions eventually stop affecting the outcome. While not a definitive solution to the paradox, this framework offers insight into how agents with limited cognitive precision may handle diverse reward structures. The paper demonstrates that the St. Petersburg series can exhibit inert behavior under this coarse addition method and suggests potential applications in behavioral modeling and machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

Abstract: The St. Petersburg paradox presents a longstanding challenge in decision theory. It describes a game whose expected value is infinite, yet for which no rational finite stake can be determined. Traditional solutions introduce auxiliary assumptions, such as diminishing marginal utility, temporal discounting, or extended number systems. These methods often involve mathematical refinements that may not correspond to how people actually perceive or process numerical information. This paper explores an alternative approach based on a modified operation of addition defined over coarse partitions of the outcome space. In this model, exact numerical values are grouped into perceptual categories, and each value is replaced by a representative element of its group before being added. This method allows for a phenomenon where repeated additions eventually cease to affect the outcome, a behavior described as inertial stabilization. Although this is not intended as a definitive resolution of the paradox, the proposed framework offers a plausible way to represent how agents with limited cognitive precision might handle divergent reward structures. We demonstrate that the St. Petersburg series can become inert under this coarse addition for a suitably constructed partition. The approach may also have broader applications in behavioral modeling and the study of machine reasoning under perceptual limitations.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored as a solution for automating the conversion of quantum programs between different Quantum SDKs. This eliminates the need for time-consuming manual design and maintenance of traditional transpilers. LLMs leverage their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities to ensure functional equivalence in the converted code. The goal is to improve interoperability and cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems. By removing the rigid mappings required in rule-based transpilers, LLMs offer a more flexible and scalable solution for quantum software portability. This approach represents a step towards enabling intelligent, general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: There exist various Software Development Kits (SDKs) tailored to different quantum computing platforms. These are known as Quantum SDKs (QSDKs). Examples include but are not limited to Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane. However, this diversity presents significant challenges for interoperability and cross-platform development of hybrid quantum-classical software systems. Traditional rule-based transpilers for translating code between QSDKs are time-consuming to design and maintain, requiring deep expertise and rigid mappings in the source and destination code. In this study, we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a flexible and automated solution. Leveraging their pretrained knowledge and contextual reasoning capabilities, we position LLMs as programming language-agnostic transpilers capable of converting quantum programs from one QSDK to another while preserving functional equivalence. Our approach eliminates the need for manually defined transformation rules and offers a scalable solution to quantum software portability. This work represents a step toward enabling intelligent, general-purpose transpilation in the quantum computing ecosystem.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation, but are fundamentally constrained by limited inference-time context and lack of explicit code structure reasoning. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a next-generation architecture for autonomous code understanding, debugging, and maintenance, designed to operate across ultra-long contexts comprising entire codebases, histories, and documentation, all without fixed window limits. Kodezi Chronos leverages a multi-level embedding memory engine, combining vector and graph-based indexing with continuous code-aware retrieval. This enables efficient and accurate reasoning over millions of lines of code, supporting repository-scale comprehension, multi-file refactoring, and real-time self-healing actions. Our evaluation introduces a novel Multi Random Retrieval benchmark, specifically tailored to the software engineering domain. Unlike classical retrieval benchmarks, this method requires the model to resolve arbitrarily distant and obfuscated associations across code artifacts, simulating realistic tasks such as variable tracing, dependency migration, and semantic bug localization.

Abstract: Dementia is a devastating condition with profound implications for individuals, families, and healthcare systems. Early and accurate detection of dementia is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While classical machine learning and deep learning approaches have been explored extensively for dementia prediction, these solutions often struggle with high-dimensional biomedical data and large-scale datasets, quickly reaching computational and performance limitations. To address this challenge, quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering faster training and advanced pattern recognition capabilities. This work aims to demonstrate the potential of quantum transfer learning (QTL) to enhance the performance of a weak classical deep learning model applied to a binary classification task for dementia detection. Besides, we show the effect of noise on the QTL-based approach, investigating the reliability and robustness of this method. Using the OASIS 2 dataset, we show how quantum techniques can transform a suboptimal classical model into a more effective solution for biomedical image classification, highlighting their potential impact on advancing healthcare technology.

Summary: 
This article explores the use of predictors in competitive algorithms in a multiagent setting. The framework introduces a two predictor system, where agents predict their own future behavior as well as that of other players. The focus is on determining the best competitive ratios achievable with different predictor qualities. A multiagent version of the ski-rental problem is introduced and analyzed within this framework. In this problem, agents can pool resources for a group license for an asset, with individual renting as a fallback. The article highlights that in the case of perfect predictions for other agents, following the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions. An algorithm with improved robustness properties is proposed and benchmarked against existing solutions. This research provides insights into the power and limitations of using predictors in competitive algorithms in a multiagent scenario. <div>
arXiv:2507.12486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the power of (competitive) algorithms with predictions in a multiagent setting. We introduce a two predictor framework, that assumes that agents use one predictor for their future (self) behavior, and one for the behavior of the other players. The main problem we are concerned with is understanding what are the best competitive ratios that can be achieved by employing such predictors, under various assumptions on predictor quality.
  As an illustration of our framework, we introduce and analyze a multiagent version of the ski-rental problem. In this problem agents can collaborate by pooling resources to get a group license for some asset. If the license price is not met then agents have to rent the asset individually for the day at a unit price. Otherwise the license becomes available forever to everyone at no extra cost.
  In the particular case of perfect other predictions the algorithm that follows the self predictor is optimal but not robust to mispredictions of agent's future behavior; we give an algorithm with better robustness properties and benchmark it.

Abstract: We introduce EaGERS, a fully training-free and model-agnostic pipeline that (1) generates natural language rationales via a vision language model, (2) grounds these rationales to spatial sub-regions by computing multimodal embedding similarities over a configurable grid with majority voting, and (3) restricts the generation of responses only from the relevant regions selected in the masked image. Experiments on the DocVQA dataset demonstrate that our best configuration not only outperforms the base model on exact match accuracy and Average Normalized Levenshtein Similarity metrics but also enhances transparency and reproducibility in DocVQA without additional model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging paradigm that combines quantum computing and federated learning (FL) to enable decentralized model training while maintaining data privacy over quantum networks. However, quantum noise remains a significant barrier in QFL, since modern quantum devices experience heterogeneous noise levels due to variances in hardware quality and sensitivity to quantum decoherence, resulting in inadequate training performance. To address this issue, we propose SpoQFL, a novel QFL framework that leverages sporadic learning to mitigate quantum noise heterogeneity in distributed quantum systems. SpoQFL dynamically adjusts training strategies based on noise fluctuations, enhancing model robustness, convergence stability, and overall learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that SpoQFL significantly outperforms conventional QFL approaches, achieving superior training performance and more stable convergence.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) and World Models (WMs) offer complementary strengths in task generalization at different levels. In this work, we propose FOUNDER, a framework that integrates the generalizable knowledge embedded in FMs with the dynamic modeling capabilities of WMs to enable open-ended task solving in embodied environments in a reward-free manner. We learn a mapping function that grounds FM representations in the WM state space, effectively inferring the agent's physical states in the world simulator from external observations. This mapping enables the learning of a goal-conditioned policy through imagination during behavior learning, with the mapped task serving as the goal state. Our method leverages the predicted temporal distance to the goal state as an informative reward signal. FOUNDER demonstrates superior performance on various multi-task offline visual control benchmarks, excelling in capturing the deep-level semantics of tasks specified by text or videos, particularly in scenarios involving complex observations or domain gaps where prior methods struggle. The consistency of our learned reward function with the ground-truth reward is also empirically validated. Our project website is https://sites.google.com/view/founder-rl.

The study showcases the effectiveness of the framework by generating object-centric event logs from real-world football data. It discusses the results obtained from different process representations.

arXiv:2507.12504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object-centric event logs expand the conventional single-case notion event log by considering multiple objects, allowing for the analysis of more complex and realistic process behavior. However, the number of real-world object-centric event logs remains limited, and further studies are needed to test their usefulness. The increasing availability of data from team sports can facilitate object-centric process mining, leveraging both real-world data and suitable use cases. In this paper, we present a framework for transforming football (soccer) data into an object-centric event log, further enhanced with a spatial dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by generating object-centric event logs based on real-world football data and discuss the results for varying process representations. With our paper, we provide the first example for object-centric event logs in football analytics. Future work should consider variant analysis and filtering techniques to better handle variability

Abstract: Recent advancements in reasoning-focused language models such as OpenAI's O1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown that scaling test-time computation-through chain-of-thought reasoning and iterative exploration-can yield substantial improvements on complex tasks like mathematics and code generation. These breakthroughs have been driven by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), particularly when combined with verifiable reward signals that provide objective and grounded supervision. In this report, we investigate the effects of prolonged reinforcement learning on a small language model across a diverse set of reasoning domains. Our work identifies several key ingredients for effective training, including the use of verifiable reward tasks, enhancements to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and practical techniques to improve training stability and generalization. We introduce controlled KL regularization, clipping ratio, and periodic reference policy resets as critical components for unlocking long-term performance gains. Our model achieves significant improvements over strong baselines, including +14.7% on math, +13.9% on coding, and +54.8% on logic puzzle tasks. To facilitate continued research, we release our model publicly.

Summary:  
- Spatial reasoning in 3D space is crucial for human cognition and tasks like navigation and manipulation.
- Current vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D tasks due to their perception of 2D images.
- The MindJourney framework couples a VLM with a world model based on video diffusion for 3D reasoning.
- MindJourney improves performance on the SAT spatial reasoning benchmark by over 8% without fine-tuning.
- This approach of pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple and effective way to enhance 3D reasoning tasks.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning in 3D space is central to human cognition and indispensable for embodied tasks such as navigation and manipulation. However, state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) struggle frequently with tasks as simple as anticipating how a scene will look after an egocentric motion: they perceive 2D images but lack an internal model of 3D dynamics. We therefore propose MindJourney, a test-time scaling framework that grants a VLM with this missing capability by coupling it to a controllable world model based on video diffusion. The VLM iteratively sketches a concise camera trajectory, while the world model synthesizes the corresponding view at each step. The VLM then reasons over this multi-view evidence gathered during the interactive exploration. Without any fine-tuning, our MindJourney achieves over an average 8% performance boost on the representative spatial reasoning benchmark SAT, showing that pairing VLMs with world models for test-time scaling offers a simple, plug-and-play route to robust 3D reasoning. Meanwhile, our method also improves upon the test-time inference VLMs trained through reinforcement learning, which demonstrates the potential of our method that utilizes world models for test-time scaling.

Summary:
The study explores how people utilize distributed and symbolic representations to construct customized mental models when facing novel situations. The proposed Model Synthesis Architecture (MSA) combines language models for global relevance-based retrieval and probabilistic programs for coherent world models. Evaluation on a novel reasoning dataset centered on a 'Model Olympics' domain shows that the MSA outperforms language model-only baselines in capturing human-like judgments. The dataset requires assessing causal structures, leveraging background knowledge, and incorporating observations with arbitrary variables. The MSA approach demonstrates the ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, reflecting human reasoning in open-ended domains. These findings suggest that MSAs hold promise for replicating human reasoning processes in complex, unfamiliar scenarios.

Abstract: When faced with novel situations, people are able to marshal relevant considerations from a wide range of background knowledge and put these to use in inferences and predictions. What permits us to draw in globally relevant information and reason over it coherently? Here, we explore the hypothesis that people use a combination of distributed and symbolic representations to construct bespoke mental models tailored to novel situations. We propose a computational implementation of this idea -- a ``Model Synthesis Architecture'' (MSA) -- using language models to implement global relevance-based retrieval and model synthesis and probabilistic programs to implement bespoke, coherent world models. We evaluate our MSA as a model of human judgments on a novel reasoning dataset. The dataset -- built around a `Model Olympics` domain of sports vignettes -- tests models' capacity for human-like, open-ended reasoning by requiring (i) judgments about novel causal structures described in language; (ii) drawing on large bodies of background knowledge; and (iii) doing both in light of observations that introduce arbitrary novel variables. Our MSA approach captures human judgments better than language model-only baselines, under both direct and chain-of-thought generations from the LM that supports model synthesis. These results suggest that MSAs can be implemented in a way that mirrors people's ability to deliver locally coherent reasoning over globally relevant variables, offering a path to understanding and replicating human reasoning in open-ended domains.

Summary:
Language models (LMs) are essential for various tasks but their ability to categorize sentences based on modality has been questioned. This study identifies modal difference vectors in LMs that can discriminate between modal categories, showing more reliable categorization judgments than previously thought. The modal difference vectors emerge consistently as models become more competent, offering insights into LM modal categorization and potential applications in understanding human categorization behavior. By correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human ratings of interpretable features, the study suggests a novel approach to modeling human modal categorization behavior. This research provides new insights into LM modal categorization and its implications for understanding human modal categorization behavior. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are used for a diverse range of tasks, from question answering to writing fantastical stories. In order to reliably accomplish these tasks, LMs must be able to discern the modal category of a sentence (i.e., whether it describes something that is possible, impossible, completely nonsensical, etc.). However, recent studies have called into question the ability of LMs to categorize sentences according to modality (Michaelov et al., 2025; Kauf et al., 2023). In this work, we identify linear representations that discriminate between modal categories within a variety of LMs, or modal difference vectors. Analysis of modal difference vectors reveals that LMs have access to more reliable modal categorization judgments than previously reported. Furthermore, we find that modal difference vectors emerge in a consistent order as models become more competent (i.e., through training steps, layers, and parameter count). Notably, we find that modal difference vectors identified within LM activations can be used to model fine-grained human categorization behavior. This potentially provides a novel view into how human participants distinguish between modal categories, which we explore by correlating projections along modal difference vectors with human participants' ratings of interpretable features. In summary, we derive new insights into LM modal categorization using techniques from mechanistic interpretability, with the potential to inform our understanding of modal categorization in humans.

Abstract: Although existing models can interact with humans and provide satisfactory responses, they lack the ability to act autonomously or engage in independent reasoning. Furthermore, input data in these models is typically provided as explicit queries, even when some sensory data is already acquired.
  In addition, AI agents, which are computational entities designed to perform tasks and make decisions autonomously based on their programming, data inputs, and learned knowledge, have shown significant progress. However, they struggle with integrating knowledge across multiple domains, unlike humans.
  Mental imagery plays a fundamental role in the brain's thinking process, which involves performing tasks based on internal multisensory data, planned actions, needs, and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we investigate how to integrate mental imagery into a machine thinking framework and how this could be beneficial in initiating the thinking process. Our proposed machine thinking framework integrates a Cognitive thinking unit supported by three auxiliary units: the Input Data Unit, the Needs Unit, and the Mental Imagery Unit. Within this framework, data is represented as natural language sentences or drawn sketches, serving both informative and decision-making purposes. We conducted validation tests for this framework, and the results are presented and discussed.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising solution for privacy-preserving autonomous driving, specifically camera-based Road Condition Classification (RCC) systems, harnessing distributed sensing, computing, and communication resources on board vehicles without sharing sensitive image data. However, the collaborative nature of FL-RCC frameworks introduces new vulnerabilities: Targeted Label Flipping Attacks (TLFAs), in which malicious clients (vehicles) deliberately alter their training data labels to compromise the learned model inference performance. Such attacks can, e.g., cause a vehicle to mis-classify slippery, dangerous road conditions as pristine and exceed recommended speed. However, TLFAs for FL-based RCC systems are largely missing. We address this challenge with a threefold contribution: 1) we disclose the vulnerability of existing FL-RCC systems to TLFAs; 2) we introduce a novel label-distance-based metric to precisely quantify the safety risks posed by TLFAs; and 3) we propose FLARE, a defensive mechanism leveraging neuron-wise analysis of the output layer to mitigate TLFA effects. Extensive experiments across three RCC tasks, four evaluation metrics, six baselines, and three deep learning models demonstrate both the severity of TLFAs on FL-RCC systems and the effectiveness of FLARE in mitigating the attack impact.

Abstract: Scientific databases aggregate vast amounts of quantitative data alongside descriptive text. In biochemistry, molecule screening assays evaluate the functional responses of candidate molecules against disease targets. Unstructured text that describes the biological mechanisms through which these targets operate, experimental screening protocols, and other attributes of assays offer rich information for new drug discovery campaigns but has been untapped because of that unstructured format. We present Assay2Mol, a large language model-based workflow that can capitalize on the vast existing biochemical screening assays for early-stage drug discovery. Assay2Mol retrieves existing assay records involving targets similar to the new target and generates candidate molecules using in-context learning with the retrieved assay screening data. Assay2Mol outperforms recent machine learning approaches that generate candidate ligand molecules for target protein structures, while also promoting more synthesizable molecule generation.

Abstract: Tree species classification from terrestrial LiDAR point clouds is challenging because of the complex multi-scale geometric structures in forest environments. Existing approaches using multi-scale dynamic graph convolutional neural networks (MS-DGCNN) employ parallel multi-scale processing, which fails to capture the semantic relationships between the hierarchical levels of the tree architecture. We present MS-DGCNN++, a hierarchical multiscale fusion dynamic graph convolutional network that uses semantically meaningful feature extraction at local, branch, and canopy scales with cross-scale information propagation. Our method employs scale-specific feature engineering, including standard geometric features for the local scale, normalized relative vectors for the branch scale, and distance information for the canopy scale. This hierarchical approach replaces uniform parallel processing with semantically differentiated representations that are aligned with the natural tree structure. Under the same proposed tree species data augmentation strategy for all experiments, MS-DGCNN++ achieved an accuracy of 94.96 \% on STPCTLS, outperforming DGCNN, MS-DGCNN, and the state-of-the-art model PPT. On FOR-species20K, it achieves 67.25\% accuracy (6.1\% improvement compared to MS-DGCNN). For standard 3D object recognition, our method outperformed DGCNN and MS-DGCNN with overall accuracies of 93.15\% on ModelNet40 and 94.05\% on ModelNet10. With lower parameters and reduced complexity compared to state-of-the-art transformer approaches, our method is suitable for resource-constrained applications while maintaining a competitive accuracy. Beyond tree classification, the method generalizes to standard 3D object recognition, establishing it as a versatile solution for diverse point cloud processing applications.

Summary:  
The article introduces TASKPGM, a framework for optimizing the mixture of task datasets for large language models (LLMs) by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF). It uses behavioral divergences to model task relationships and select continuous task proportions, providing a closed-form solution under simplex constraints. The method balances representativeness and diversity among tasks, offering theoretical guarantees like weak submodularity for budgeted variants. Empirical results on Llama 2 and Mistral show consistent improvements in evaluation suites, such as MMLU and BIGBench. TASKPGM also provides interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a valuable tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning. <div>

Abstract: The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically on the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend of task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with practitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We introduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization that selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over a Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral divergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information computed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our method yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably balances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical guarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate consistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation suites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers interpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a powerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.

<div> characterization, LLM training, startup overhead, optimization framework, Bootseer <br />
Summary:
This research focuses on analyzing and addressing the startup overhead in Large Language Models (LLMs) training. The study reveals that startup overhead is a significant issue in industrial-scale LLMs, wasting up to 3.5% of GPU time. By examining the components of startup cost and its impact on training jobs, the researchers introduce Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework. Bootseer tackles three primary startup bottlenecks - container image loading, runtime dependency installation, and model checkpoint resumption - through techniques like hot block record-and-prefetch, dependency snapshotting, and striped HDFS-FUSE. Deployed in a production environment, Bootseer reduces startup overhead by 50%, showcasing its effectiveness in improving training efficiency for LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving breakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs involving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is important to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup overhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training efficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly critical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs begin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large, industrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams operate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more than 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.
  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training startup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of startup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job size. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level optimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a) container image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model checkpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three techniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and (c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment and evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in startup overhead.

<div> Keywords: channel estimation, neural networks, wireless channels, synthetic training datasets, generalization

Summary:<br /><br />
Channel estimation in cognitive communications is essential for spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission. Neural networks are often tested on similar channels, leading to performance degradation on new data. This paper proposes offline-trained neural networks that can robustly perform over wireless channels without prior channel information. The design criteria generate synthetic training datasets guaranteeing a certain mean squared error on new channels. A benchmark design ensures intelligent operation for different channel profiles. Generalization achieved is independent of neural network architecture, demonstrated through simulations showing robust generalization to both fixed and variable delay spread wireless channels. Offline-trained neural networks alleviate the need for time-consuming online training, making them suitable for real-world implementations without parameter updates. <div>

Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in cognitive communications, as it enables intelligent spectrum sensing and adaptive transmission by providing accurate information about the current channel state. However, in many papers neural networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error (MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, neural network solutions require no prior channel information or parameters update for real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations, neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.

Summary: <br /><br />Quantum circuits must be error-resilient, and the use of large language models like Granite-20B-Code and StarCoder can result in flawed Qiskit code. In this study, a 32B model was fine-tuned using two reinforcement learning (RL) methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), with a synthetic dataset. The models were evaluated on the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, where ORPO achieved a 56.29% Pass rate at 1 attempt, showing improvement over existing models. GRPO scored 49%, outperforming general-purpose baselines as well. While GRPO excelled in basic tasks and ORPO in intermediate ones, both models were unable to solve advanced tasks. This study underscores the progress in AI-assisted quantum programming but also highlights the need for further advancements in this field. <div>

Abstract: Tool design and use reflect the ability to understand and manipulate the physical world through creativity, planning, and foresight. As such, these capabilities are often regarded as measurable indicators of intelligence across biological species. While much of today's research on robotic intelligence focuses on generating better controllers, inventing smarter tools offers a complementary form of physical intelligence: shifting the onus of problem-solving onto the tool's design. Given the vast and impressive common-sense, reasoning, and creative capabilities of today's foundation models, we investigate whether these models can provide useful priors to automatically design and effectively wield such tools? We present VLMgineer, a framework that harnesses the code generation abilities of vision language models (VLMs) together with evolutionary search to iteratively co-design physical tools and the action plans that operate them to perform a task. We evaluate VLMgineer on a diverse new benchmark of everyday manipulation scenarios that demand creative tool design and use. Across this suite, VLMgineer consistently discovers tools and policies that solve tasks more effectively and innovatively, transforming challenging robotics problems into straightforward executions. It also outperforms VLM-generated designs from human specifications and existing human-crafted tools for everyday tasks. To facilitate future research on automated tool invention, we will release our benchmark and code.

Summary:<br />
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) integrate physical laws into deep learning for solving complex problems. However, they often struggle with extrapolation outside the training data and sensitivity to activation functions (AFs). This study introduces transfer learning (TL) to enhance PINNs' extrapolation capability within an extended training domain. TL is applied using a few selected collocation points, and an adaptive AF combining standard AFs is proposed for improved model accuracy and robustness. Experimental results show a 40% average reduction in relative L2 error and 50% average reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain without significant computational cost increase. The code for the method is available on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are deep learning models that incorporate the governing physical laws of a system into the learning process, making them well-suited for solving complex scientific and engineering problems. Recently, PINNs have gained widespread attention as a powerful framework for combining physical principles with data-driven modeling to improve prediction accuracy. Despite their successes, however, PINNs often exhibit poor extrapolation performance outside the training domain and are highly sensitive to the choice of activation functions (AFs). In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning (TL) method to improve the extrapolation capability of PINNs. Our approach applies transfer learning (TL) within an extended training domain, using only a small number of carefully selected collocation points. Additionally, we propose an adaptive AF that takes the form of a linear combination of standard AFs, which improves both the robustness and accuracy of the model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves an average of 40% reduction in relative L2 error and an average of 50% reduction in mean absolute error in the extrapolation domain, all without a significant increase in computational cost.

Summary:
The Single Conversation Methodology (SCM) is a novel approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). It emphasizes structured and persistent development dialogues, where all project stages occur within a single conversation. Grounded in principles of cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation, SCM defines phases, best practices, and a philosophical stance. It aims to correct passive reliance on LLMs by reasserting the active role of developers as architects and supervisors of intelligent tools. SCM offers a pragmatic solution to ad hoc interactions with generative AI by fostering a more organized and transparent development process.

Abstract: We propose the Single Conversation Methodology (SCM), a novel and pragmatic approach to software development using large language models (LLMs). In contrast to ad hoc interactions with generative AI, SCM emphasizes a structured and persistent development dialogue, where all stages of a project - from requirements to architecture and implementation - unfold within a single, long-context conversation. The methodology is grounded on principles of cognitive clarity, traceability, modularity, and documentation. We define its phases, best practices, and philosophical stance, while arguing that SCM offers a necessary correction to the passive reliance on LLMs prevalent in current practices. We aim to reassert the active role of the developer as architect and supervisor of the intelligent tool.

The app combines patient metadata with fundus images to accurately diagnose these diseases. The three-stage pipeline includes real-time image quality assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model. Key innovations in the disease diagnosis model include multimodal fusion technique, pretraining method, and multitask model. Trained on BRSET and mBRSET datasets, InSight demonstrates high accuracy in diagnosing the five diseases and is robust across various image conditions. The multitask model contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it computationally efficient. This innovation has the potential to improve access to screenings, especially in low-resource settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic macular edema, and pathological myopia affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Early screening for these diseases is essential, yet access to medical care remains limited in low- and middle-income countries as well as in resource-limited settings. We develop InSight, an AI-based app that combines patient metadata with fundus images for accurate diagnosis of five common eye diseases to improve accessibility of screenings.
  Methods: InSight features a three-stage pipeline: real-time image quality assessment, disease diagnosis model, and a DR grading model to assess severity. Our disease diagnosis model incorporates three key innovations: (a) Multimodal fusion technique (MetaFusion) combining clinical metadata and images; (b) Pretraining method leveraging supervised and self-supervised loss functions; and (c) Multitask model to simultaneously predict 5 diseases. We make use of BRSET (lab-captured images) and mBRSET (smartphone-captured images) datasets, both of which also contain clinical metadata for model training/evaluation.
  Results: Trained on a dataset of BRSET and mBRSET images, the image quality checker achieves near-100% accuracy in filtering out low-quality fundus images. The multimodal pretrained disease diagnosis model outperforms models using only images by 6% in balanced accuracy for BRSET and 4% for mBRSET.
  Conclusions: The InSight pipeline demonstrates robustness across varied image conditions and has high diagnostic accuracy across all five diseases, generalizing to both smartphone and lab captured images. The multitask model contributes to the lightweight nature of the pipeline, making it five times computationally efficient compared to having five individual models corresponding to each disease.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) can do complex reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT) involving cognitive strategies such as backtracking and self-correction. Recent studies suggest that some models inherently possess these long reasoning abilities, which may be unlocked via extra training. Our work first investigates whether we can elicit such behavior without any training. To this end, we propose a decoding-time approach, ThinkLogit, which utilizes logits arithmetic (Liu et al., 2024) to tune a target large LM for long reasoning using a substantially smaller model as guider. We then show that we can further boost performance by training the guider model with preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the target and guider model -- a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement in pass@1 by 26% and 29%, respectively, over four mathematical datasets using the Qwen2.5-32B when guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B -- a model 21x smaller. Lastly, we show that ThinkLogit can transfer long reasoning skills acquired through reinforcement learning, improving pass@1 by 13% relative compared to the Qwen2.5-32B base model. Our work presents a computationally-efficient method to elicit long reasoning in large models with minimal or no additional training.

Abstract: Unified Medical Image Segmentation (UMIS) is critical for comprehensive anatomical assessment but faces challenges due to multi-scale structural heterogeneity. Conventional pixel-based approaches, lacking object-level anatomical insight and inter-organ relational modeling, struggle with morphological complexity and feature conflicts, limiting their efficacy in UMIS. We propose Mamba Snake, a novel deep snake framework enhanced by state space modeling for UMIS. Mamba Snake frames multi-contour evolution as a hierarchical state space atlas, effectively modeling macroscopic inter-organ topological relationships and microscopic contour refinements. We introduce a snake-specific vision state space module, the Mamba Evolution Block (MEB), which leverages effective spatiotemporal information aggregation for adaptive refinement of complex morphologies. Energy map shape priors further ensure robust long-range contour evolution in heterogeneous data. Additionally, a dual-classification synergy mechanism is incorporated to concurrently optimize detection and segmentation, mitigating under-segmentation of microstructures in UMIS. Extensive evaluations across five clinical datasets reveal Mamba Snake's superior performance, with an average Dice improvement of 3\% over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Emotional talking-head generation has emerged as a pivotal research area at the intersection of computer vision and multimodal artificial intelligence, with its core value lying in enhancing human-computer interaction through immersive and empathetic engagement.With the advancement of multimodal large language models, the driving signals for emotional talking-head generation has shifted from audio and video to more flexible text. However, current text-driven methods rely on predefined discrete emotion label texts, oversimplifying the dynamic complexity of real facial muscle movements and thus failing to achieve natural emotional expressiveness.This study proposes the Think-Before-Draw framework to address two key challenges: (1) In-depth semantic parsing of emotions--by innovatively introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT), abstract emotion labels are transformed into physiologically grounded facial muscle movement descriptions, enabling the mapping from high-level semantics to actionable motion features; and (2) Fine-grained expressiveness optimization--inspired by artists' portrait painting process, a progressive guidance denoising strategy is proposed, employing a "global emotion localization--local muscle control" mechanism to refine micro-expression dynamics in generated videos.Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks, including MEAD and HDTF. Additionally, we collected a set of portrait images to evaluate our model's zero-shot generation capability.

Abstract: As the global population ages, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered agents have emerged as potential tools to support older adults' caregiving. Prior research has explored agent autonomy by identifying key interaction stages in task processes and defining the agent's role at each stage. However, ensuring that agents align with older adults' autonomy preferences remains a critical challenge. Drawing on interdisciplinary conceptualizations of autonomy, this paper examines four key dimensions of autonomy for older adults: decision-making autonomy, goal-oriented autonomy, control autonomy, and social responsibility autonomy. This paper then proposes the following research directions: (1) Addressing social responsibility autonomy, which concerns the ethical and social implications of agent use in communal settings; (2) Operationalizing agent autonomy from the task perspective; and (3) Developing autonomy measures.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Synergy, a language model that bridges different levels of abstraction in an end-to-end fashion through a learned routing mechanism. Focusing on low-level linguistic abstraction, we trained our model as a byte-level language model. Our model spontaneously learns to tokenize bytes, producing fewer concept tokens than Byte-level Byte Pair Encoder (BBPE) tokenizers while keeping comparable performance. By comparing with Llama3, we observed an advantage of Synergy under the same model scale and training dataset size. Further studies show that the middle part (the higher abstraction part) of our model performs better when positional encodings are removed, suggesting the emergence of position-independent concepts. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of tokenizer-free architectures, paving the way for more robust and flexible pipelines.

<title>Local Representative Token Guided Merging for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Stable diffusion is an outstanding image generation model for text-to-image, but its time-consuming generation process remains a challenge due to the quadratic complexity of attention operations. Recent token merging methods improve efficiency by reducing the number of tokens during attention operations, but often overlook the characteristics of attention-based image generation models, limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose local representative token guided merging (ReToM), a novel token merging strategy applicable to any attention mechanism in image generation. To merge tokens based on various contextual information, ReToM defines local boundaries as windows within attention inputs and adjusts window sizes. Furthermore, we introduce a representative token, which represents the most representative token per window by computing similarity at a specific timestep and selecting the token with the highest average similarity. This approach preserves the most salient local features while minimizing computational overhead. Experimental results show that ReToM achieves a 6.2% improvement in FID and higher CLIP scores compared to the baseline, while maintaining comparable inference time. We empirically demonstrate that ReToM is effective in balancing visual quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in transforming healthcare through the analysis and modeling of electronic health records (EHRs). However, the inherent heterogeneity, temporal irregularity, and domain-specific nature of EHR data present unique challenges that differ fundamentally from those in vision and natural language tasks. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent advancements at the intersection of deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and EHR modeling. We introduce a unified taxonomy that spans five key design dimensions: data-centric approaches, neural architecture design, learning-focused strategies, multimodal learning, and LLM-based modeling systems. Within each dimension, we review representative methods addressing data quality enhancement, structural and temporal representation, self-supervised learning, and integration with clinical knowledge. We further highlight emerging trends such as foundation models, LLM-driven clinical agents, and EHR-to-text translation for downstream reasoning. Finally, we discuss open challenges in benchmarking, explainability, clinical alignment, and generalization across diverse clinical settings. This survey aims to provide a structured roadmap for advancing AI-driven EHR modeling and clinical decision support.

Abstract: As the data volume of astronomical imaging surveys rapidly increases, traditional methods for image anomaly detection, such as visual inspection by human experts, are becoming impractical. We introduce a machine-learning-based approach to detect poor-quality exposures in large imaging surveys, with a focus on the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) in regions of low extinction (i.e., $E(B-V)<0.04$). Our semi-supervised pipeline integrates a vision transformer (ViT), trained via self-supervised learning (SSL), with a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier. We train and validate our pipeline using a small set of labeled exposures observed by surveys with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam). A clustering-space analysis of where our pipeline places images labeled in ``good'' and ``bad'' categories suggests that our approach can efficiently and accurately determine the quality of exposures. Applied to new imaging being reduced for DECaLS Data Release 11, our pipeline identifies 780 problematic exposures, which we subsequently verify through visual inspection. Being highly efficient and adaptable, our method offers a scalable solution for quality control in other large imaging surveys.

<title>City-VLM: Towards Multidomain Perception Scene Understanding via Multimodal Incomplete Learning</title>

Abstract: Scene understanding enables intelligent agents to interpret and comprehend their environment. While existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) for scene understanding have primarily focused on indoor household tasks, they face two significant limitations when applied to outdoor large-scale scene understanding. First, outdoor scenarios typically encompass larger-scale environments observed through various sensors from multiple viewpoints (e.g., bird view and terrestrial view), while existing indoor LVLMs mainly analyze single visual modalities within building-scale contexts from humanoid viewpoints. Second, existing LVLMs suffer from missing multidomain perception outdoor data and struggle to effectively integrate 2D and 3D visual information. To address the aforementioned limitations, we build the first multidomain perception outdoor scene understanding dataset, named \textbf{\underline{SVM-City}}, deriving from multi\textbf{\underline{S}}cale scenarios with multi\textbf{\underline{V}}iew and multi\textbf{\underline{M}}odal instruction tuning data. It contains $420$k images and $4, 811$M point clouds with $567$k question-answering pairs from vehicles, low-altitude drones, high-altitude aerial planes, and satellite. To effectively fuse the multimodal data in the absence of one modality, we introduce incomplete multimodal learning to model outdoor scene understanding and design the LVLM named \textbf{\underline{City-VLM}}. Multimodal fusion is realized by constructing a joint probabilistic distribution space rather than implementing directly explicit fusion operations (e.g., concatenation). Experimental results on three typical outdoor scene understanding tasks show City-VLM achieves $18.14 \%$ performance surpassing existing LVLMs in question-answering tasks averagely. Our method demonstrates pragmatic and generalization performance across multiple outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Time series prediction, a crucial task across various domains, faces significant challenges due to the inherent complexities of time series data, including non-stationarity, multi-scale periodicity, and transient dynamics, particularly when tackling long-term predictions. While Transformer-based architectures have shown promise, their quadratic complexity with sequence length hinders their efficiency for long-term predictions. Recent advancements in State-Space Models, such as Mamba, offer a more efficient alternative for long-term modeling, but they cannot capture multi-scale periodicity and transient dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, they are susceptible to data noise issues in time series. This paper proposes a novel framework, FLDmamba (Fourier and Laplace Transform Decomposition Mamba), addressing these limitations. FLDmamba leverages the strengths of both Fourier and Laplace transforms to effectively capture both multi-scale periodicity, transient dynamics within time series data, and improve the robustness of the model to the data noise issue. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FLDmamba achieves superior performance on time series prediction benchmarks, outperforming both Transformer-based and other Mamba-based architectures. To promote the reproducibility of our method, we have made both the code and data accessible via the following URL:{\href{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/FLDmamba}{https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/\model}.

Abstract: Learning-based lossless compressors play a crucial role in large-scale genomic database backup, storage, transmission, and management. However, their 1) inadequate compression ratio, 2) low compression \& decompression throughput, and 3) poor compression robustness limit their widespread adoption and application in both industry and academia. To solve those challenges, we propose a novel \underline{P}arallel \underline{M}ulti-\underline{K}nowledge \underline{L}earning-based \underline{C}ompressor (PMKLC) with four crucial designs: 1) We propose an automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework as compressors' backbone to enhance compression ratio and robustness; 2) we design a GPU-accelerated ($s$,$k$)-mer encoder to optimize compression throughput and computing resource usage; 3) we introduce data block partitioning and Step-wise Model Passing (SMP) mechanisms for parallel acceleration; 4) We design two compression modes PMKLC-S and PMKLC-M to meet the complex application scenarios, where the former runs on a resource-constrained single GPU and the latter is multi-GPU accelerated. We benchmark PMKLC-S/M and 14 baselines (7 traditional and 7 leaning-based) on 15 real-world datasets with different species and data sizes. Compared to baselines on the testing datasets, PMKLC-S/M achieve the average compression ratio improvement up to 73.609\% and 73.480\%, the average throughput improvement up to 3.036$\times$ and 10.710$\times$, respectively. Besides, PMKLC-S/M also achieve the best robustness and competitive memory cost, indicating its greater stability against datasets with different probability distribution perturbations, and its strong ability to run on memory-constrained devices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at modeling relationships between strings in natural language and have shown promise in extending to other symbolic domains like coding or mathematics. However, the extent to which they implicitly model symbolic music remains underexplored. This paper investigates how LLMs represent musical concepts by generating symbolic music data from textual prompts describing combinations of genres and styles, and evaluating their utility through recognition and generation tasks. We produce a dataset of LLM-generated MIDI files without relying on explicit musical training. We then train neural networks entirely on this LLM-generated MIDI dataset and perform genre and style classification as well as melody completion, benchmarking their performance against established models. Our results demonstrate that LLMs can infer rudimentary musical structures and temporal relationships from text, highlighting both their potential to implicitly encode musical patterns and their limitations due to a lack of explicit musical context, shedding light on their generative capabilities for symbolic music.

<title>FIQ: Fundamental Question Generation with the Integration of Question Embeddings for Video Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Video question answering (VQA) is a multimodal task that requires the interpretation of a video to answer a given question. Existing VQA methods primarily utilize question and answer (Q&amp;A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal characteristics of video content. However, these annotations are typically event-centric, which is not enough to capture the broader context of each video. The absence of essential details such as object types, spatial layouts, and descriptive attributes restricts the model to learning only a fragmented scene representation. This issue limits the model's capacity for generalization and higher-level reasoning. In this paper, we propose a fundamental question generation with the integration of question embeddings for video question answering (FIQ), a novel approach designed to strengthen the reasoning ability of the model by enhancing the fundamental understanding of videos. FIQ generates Q&amp;A pairs based on descriptions extracted from videos, enriching the training data with fundamental scene information. Generated Q&amp;A pairs enable the model to understand the primary context, leading to enhanced generalizability and reasoning ability. Furthermore, we incorporate a VQ-CAlign module that assists task-specific question embeddings with visual features, ensuring that essential domain-specific details are preserved to increase the adaptability of downstream tasks. Experiments on SUTD-TrafficQA demonstrate that our FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing baseline methods.

Abstract: Food is not only a core component of humans' daily diets, but also an important carrier of cultural heritage and emotional bonds. With the development of technology, the need for accurate classification of food images has grown, which is crucial for a variety of application scenarios. However, existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) face significant challenges when dealing with fine-grained food images that are similar in shape but subtle in detail. To address this challenge, this study presents an innovative method for classifying food images, named Feature-Enhanced TResNet (FE-TResNet), specifically designed to address fine-grained food images and accurately capture subtle features within them. The FE-TResNet method is based on the TResNet model and integrates Style-based Recalibration Module (StyleRM) and Deep Channel-wise Attention (DCA) technologies to enhance feature extraction capabilities. In experimental validation on Chinese food image datasets ChineseFoodNet and CNFOOD-241, the FE-TResNet method significantly improved classification accuracy, achieving rates of 81.37% and 80.29%, respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness and superiority in fine-grained food image classification.

Abstract: Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and 308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Image captioning has emerged as a crucial task in the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing, enabling automated generation of descriptive text from visual content. In the context of remote sensing, image captioning plays a significant role in interpreting vast and complex satellite imagery, aiding applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and urban planning. This motivates us, in this paper, to present a transformer based network architecture for remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) in which multiple techniques of Static Expansion, Memory-Augmented Self-Attention, Mesh Transformer are evaluated and integrated. We evaluate our proposed models using two benchmark remote sensing image datasets of UCM-Caption and NWPU-Caption. Our best model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems on most of evaluation metrics, which demonstrates potential to apply for real-life remote sensing image systems.

Abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of operating over extended periods -- spanning days, weeks, and even months -- they are expected to accumulate knowledge of their environments and leverage this experience to assist humans more effectively. This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied Question Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past experiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex, temporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically focus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a single past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past, present, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult its memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer. Standard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to limited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to combine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a structured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from cognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based world instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables targeted memory retrieval and guided navigation. To balance the exploration-recall trade-off, we introduce value-of-information-based stopping criteria that determines when the agent has gathered sufficient information. We evaluate our method on real-world experiments and introduce a new benchmark that spans popular simulation environments and actual industrial sites. Our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding substantial gains in both answer accuracy and exploration efficiency.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) on curated (or filtered) data is the predominant paradigm for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of large language models; as well as for imitation learning of control policies. Here, we draw on a connection between this successful strategy and the theory and practice of finding optimal policies via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Building on existing literature, we clarify that SFT can be understood as maximizing a lower bound on the RL objective in a sparse reward setting. Giving support to its often observed good performance. From this viewpoint, we realize that a small modification to SFT leads to an importance weighted variant that behaves closer to training with RL as it: i) optimizes a tighter bound to the RL objective and, ii) can improve performance compared to SFT on curated data. We refer to this variant as importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT). We show that it is easy to implement and can be further generalized to training with quality scored data. The resulting SFT variants are competitive with more advanced RL algorithms for large language models and for training policies in continuous control tasks. For example achieving 66.7% on the AIME 2024 dataset.

Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios. Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task. Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training. Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline methods.

Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning with applications in natural language processing, computer vision, and beyond. However, their computational demands make it challenging to deploy them on low-power edge devices. This paper introduces an ultra-low-power, Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Array (CGRA) architecture specifically designed to accelerate General Matrix Multiplication (GEMM) operations in transformer models tailored for the energy and resource constraints of edge applications. The proposed architecture integrates a 4 x 4 array of Processing Elements (PEs) for efficient parallel computation and dedicated 4 x 2 Memory Operation Blocks (MOBs) for optimized LOAD/STORE operations, reducing memory bandwidth demands and enhancing data reuse. A switchless mesh torus interconnect network further minimizes power and latency by enabling direct communication between PEs and MOBs, eliminating the need for centralized switching. Through its heterogeneous array design and efficient dataflow, this CGRA architecture addresses the unique computational needs of transformers, offering a scalable pathway to deploy sophisticated machine learning models on edge devices.

<title>Argus: Leveraging Multiview Images for Improved 3-D Scene Understanding With Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct applications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed a remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling tasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point clouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results in information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone to omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds. Besides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of details caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense reconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency with 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene components, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on these insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that leverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In general, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model (3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D multi-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to tackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and camera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features to create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach compensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and helps LLMs better understand the 3D world. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing 3D-LMMs in various downstream tasks.

<title>Making Language Model a Hierarchical Classifier and Generator</title>

Abstract: Decoder-only language models, such as GPT and LLaMA, generally decode on the last layer. Motivated by human's hierarchical thinking capability, we propose that a hierarchical decoder architecture could be built with different layers decoding texts simultaneously. Due to limited time and computationally resources, we choose to adapt a pretrained language model into this form of hierarchical decoder. Language heads of the last layer are copied to different selected intermediate layers, and fine-tuned with different task inputs. By thorough experiments, we validate that these selective intermediate layers could be adapted to speak meaningful and reasonable contents, and this paradigm of hierarchical decoder can obtain state-of-the-art performances on multiple tasks such as hierarchical text classification, classification-guided generation, and hierarchical text generation. This study suggests the possibility of a generalized hierarchical reasoner, pretraining from scratch.

<title>DMQ: Dissecting Outliers of Diffusion Models for Post-Training Quantization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12933</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but come with significant computational costs, posing challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by focusing on the iterative nature of diffusion models. However, these approaches often overlook outliers, leading to degraded performance at low bit-widths. In this paper, we propose a DMQ which combines Learned Equivalent Scaling (LES) and channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling (PTS) to effectively address these challenges. Learned Equivalent Scaling optimizes channel-wise scaling factors to redistribute quantization difficulty between weights and activations, reducing overall quantization error. Recognizing that early denoising steps, despite having small quantization errors, crucially impact the final output due to error accumulation, we incorporate an adaptive timestep weighting scheme to prioritize these critical steps during learning. Furthermore, identifying that layers such as skip connections exhibit high inter-channel variance, we introduce channel-wise Power-of-Two Scaling for activations. To ensure robust selection of PTS factors even with small calibration set, we introduce a voting algorithm that enhances reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing works, especially at low bit-widths such as W4A6 (4-bit weight, 6-bit activation) and W4A8, maintaining high image generation quality and model stability. The code is available at https://github.com/LeeDongYeun/dmq.

Abstract: An increasing number of applications are exploiting sampling-based algorithms for planning, optimization, and inference. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms form the computational backbone of this emerging branch of machine learning. Unfortunately, the high computational cost limits their feasibility for large-scale problems and real-world applications, and the existing MCMC acceleration solutions are either limited in hardware flexibility or fail to maintain efficiency at the system level across a variety of end-to-end applications. This paper introduces \textbf{MC$^2$A}, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework, enabling efficient and flexible optimization for MCMC acceleration. Firstly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} analyzes the MCMC workload diversity through an extension of the processor performance roofline model with a 3rd dimension to derive the optimal balance between the compute, sampling and memory parameters. Secondly, \textbf{MC$^2$A} proposes a parametrized hardware accelerator architecture with flexible and efficient support of MCMC kernels with a pipeline of ISA-programmable tree-structured processing units, reconfigurable samplers and a crossbar interconnect to support irregular access. Thirdly, the core of \textbf{MC$^2$A} is powered by a novel Gumbel sampler that eliminates exponential and normalization operations. In the end-to-end case study, \textbf{MC$^2$A} achieves an overall {$307.6\times$, $1.4\times$, $2.0\times$, $84.2\times$} speedup compared to the CPU, GPU, TPU and state-of-the-art MCMC accelerator. Evaluated on various representative MCMC workloads, this work demonstrates and exploits the feasibility of general hardware acceleration to popularize MCMC-based solutions in diverse application domains.

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) plays a crucial role in speech-centric multimedia applications, enabling machines to comprehend spoken language in scenarios such as meetings, interviews, and customer service interactions. SLU encompasses multiple tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER), and spoken Sentiment Analysis (SA). However, existing methods often rely on separate model architectures for individual tasks such as spoken NER and SA, which increases system complexity, limits cross-task interaction, and fails to fully exploit heterogeneous datasets available across tasks. To address these limitations, we propose UniSLU, a unified framework that jointly models multiple SLU tasks within a single architecture. Specifically, we propose a unified representation for diverse SLU tasks, enabling full utilization of heterogeneous datasets across multiple tasks. Built upon this representation, we propose a unified generative method that jointly models ASR, spoken NER, and SA tasks, enhancing task interactions and enabling seamless integration with large language models to harness their powerful generative capabilities. Extensive experiments on public SLU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior SLU performance compared to several benchmark methods, making it well-suited for real-world speech-based multimedia scenarios. We will release all code and models at github to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Pigmented skin lesions represent localized areas of increased melanin and can indicate serious conditions like melanoma, a major contributor to skin cancer mortality. The MedMNIST v2 dataset, inspired by MNIST, was recently introduced to advance research in biomedical imaging and includes DermaMNIST, a dataset for classifying pigmented lesions based on the HAM10000 dataset. This study assesses ResNet-50 and EfficientNetV2L models for multi-class classification using DermaMNIST, employing transfer learning and various layer configurations. One configuration achieves results that match or surpass existing methods. This study suggests that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can drive progress in biomedical image analysis, significantly enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. However, diagnosing these conditions is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. In this study, we employ a multifaceted approach to address the challenge of recognizing wrist pathologies using an extremely limited dataset. Initially, we approach the problem as a fine-grained recognition task, aiming to identify subtle X-ray pathologies that conventional CNNs overlook. Secondly, we enhance network performance by fusing patient metadata with X-ray images. Thirdly, rather than pre-training on a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet, we utilize weights trained on a fine-grained dataset. While metadata integration has been used in other medical domains, this is a novel application for wrist pathologies. Our results show that a fine-grained strategy and metadata integration improve diagnostic accuracy by 2% with a limited dataset and by over 10% with a larger fracture-focused dataset.

<title>A Distributed Generative AI Approach for Heterogeneous Multi-Domain Environments under Data Sharing constraints</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning has gained increasing attention for its ability to enable multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables the utilization of distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experimental results shows that our approach demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across key performance metrics, where it achieves 1.1x -- 2.2x higher image generation scores, an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 50% in multi-domain non-IID settings), in much lower latency compared to several benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper presents our approach for the IberLEF 2025 Task PRESTA: Preguntas y Respuestas sobre Tablas en Espa\~nol (Questions and Answers about Tables in Spanish). Our solution obtains answers to the questions by implementing Python code generation with LLMs that is used to filter and process the table. This solution evolves from the MRT implementation for the Semeval 2025 related task. The process consists of multiple steps: analyzing and understanding the content of the table, selecting the useful columns, generating instructions in natural language, translating these instructions to code, running it, and handling potential errors or exceptions. These steps use open-source LLMs and fine-grained optimized prompts for each step. With this approach, we achieved an accuracy score of 85\% in the task.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting the internal representations of Large Language Models, yet they often fail to capture domain-specific features not prevalent in their training corpora. This paper introduces a residual learning approach that addresses this feature blindness without requiring complete retraining. We propose training a secondary SAE specifically to model the reconstruction error of a pretrained SAE on domain-specific texts, effectively capturing features missed by the primary model. By summing the outputs of both models during inference, we demonstrate significant improvements in both LLM cross-entropy and explained variance metrics across multiple specialized domains. Our experiments show that this method efficiently incorporates new domain knowledge into existing SAEs while maintaining their performance on general tasks. This approach enables researchers to selectively enhance SAE interpretability for specific domains of interest, opening new possibilities for targeted mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.

<title>SMART: Relation-Aware Learning of Geometric Representations for Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph representation learning approaches provide a mapping between symbolic knowledge in the form of triples in a knowledge graph (KG) and their feature vectors. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models often represent relations in a KG as geometric transformations. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) KGE models are derived from elementary geometric transformations (EGTs), such as translation, scaling, rotation, and reflection, or their combinations. These geometric transformations enable the models to effectively preserve specific structural and relational patterns of the KG. However, the current use of EGTs by KGEs remains insufficient without considering relation-specific transformations. Although recent models attempted to address this problem by ensembling SOTA baseline models in different ways, only a single or composite version of geometric transformations are used by such baselines to represent all the relations. In this paper, we propose a framework that evaluates how well each relation fits with different geometric transformations. Based on this ranking, the model can: (1) assign the best-matching transformation to each relation, or (2) use majority voting to choose one transformation type to apply across all relations. That is, the model learns a single relation-specific EGT in low dimensional vector space through an attention mechanism. Furthermore, we use the correlation between relations and EGTs, which are learned in a low dimension, for relation embeddings in a high dimensional vector space. The effectiveness of our models is demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on three benchmark KGs as well as a real-world financial KG, witnessing a performance comparable to leading models

Abstract: Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but their idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect physically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce VLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and wheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several ego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical pipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action prediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free, map-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results reveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation space, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like collisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged robots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless integration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN evaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical deployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's overall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to rethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models. The code is available at https://crystalsixone.github.io/vln_pe.github.io/.

Abstract: Robust XAI techniques should ideally be simultaneously deterministic, model agnostic, and guaranteed to converge. We propose MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEM AGNOSTIC EXPLAINABLE AI (MUPAX), a deterministic, model agnostic explainability technique, with guaranteed convergency. MUPAX measure theoretic formulation gives principled feature importance attribution through structured perturbation analysis that discovers inherent input patterns and eliminates spurious relationships. We evaluate MUPAX on an extensive range of data modalities and tasks: audio classification (1D), image classification (2D), volumetric medical image analysis (3D), and anatomical landmark detection, demonstrating dimension agnostic effectiveness. The rigorous convergence guarantees extend to any loss function and arbitrary dimensions, making MUPAX applicable to virtually any problem context for AI. By contrast with other XAI methods that typically decrease performance when masking, MUPAX not only preserves but actually enhances model accuracy by capturing only the most important patterns of the original data. Extensive benchmarking against the state of the XAI art demonstrates MUPAX ability to generate precise, consistent and understandable explanations, a crucial step towards explainable and trustworthy AI systems. The source code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework, GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy visual observations.

Abstract: Learning-based monocular visual odometry (VO) poses robustness, generalization, and efficiency challenges in robotics. Recent advances in visual foundation models, such as DINOv2, have improved robustness and generalization in various vision tasks, yet their integration in VO remains limited due to coarse feature granularity. In this paper, we present DINO-VO, a feature-based VO system leveraging DINOv2 visual foundation model for its sparse feature matching. To address the integration challenge, we propose a salient keypoints detector tailored to DINOv2's coarse features. Furthermore, we complement DINOv2's robust-semantic features with fine-grained geometric features, resulting in more localizable representations. Finally, a transformer-based matcher and differentiable pose estimation layer enable precise camera motion estimation by learning good matches. Against prior detector-descriptor networks like SuperPoint, DINO-VO demonstrates greater robustness in challenging environments. Furthermore, we show superior accuracy and generalization of the proposed feature descriptors against standalone DINOv2 coarse features. DINO-VO outperforms prior frame-to-frame VO methods on the TartanAir and KITTI datasets and is competitive on EuRoC dataset, while running efficiently at 72 FPS with less than 1GB of memory usage on a single GPU. Moreover, it performs competitively against Visual SLAM systems on outdoor driving scenarios, showcasing its generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language navigation (VLN) were mainly attributed to emerging large language models (LLMs). These methods exhibited excellent generalization capabilities in instruction understanding and task reasoning. However, they were constrained by the fixed knowledge bases and reasoning abilities of LLMs, preventing fully incorporating experiential knowledge and thus resulting in a lack of efficient evolutionary capacity. To address this, we drew inspiration from the evolution capabilities of natural agents, and proposed a self-evolving VLN framework (SE-VLN) to endow VLN agents with the ability to continuously evolve during testing. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that an multimodal LLM-powered self-evolving VLN framework was proposed. Specifically, SE-VLN comprised three core modules, i.e., a hierarchical memory module to transfer successful and failure cases into reusable knowledge, a retrieval-augmented thought-based reasoning module to retrieve experience and enable multi-step decision-making, and a reflection module to realize continual evolution. Comprehensive tests illustrated that the SE-VLN achieved navigation success rates of 57% and 35.2% in unseen environments, representing absolute performance improvements of 23.9% and 15.0% over current state-of-the-art methods on R2R and REVERSE datasets, respectively. Moreover, the SE-VLN showed performance improvement with increasing experience repository, elucidating its great potential as a self-evolving agent framework for VLN.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as a fundamental yet challenging problem in the pursuit of more reliable, controllable, and capable machine intelligence. The recent success of reasoning models and conversational AI systems has underscored the critical role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing these systems, driving increased research interest at the intersection of RL and LLM alignment. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in LLM alignment through the lens of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), emphasizing the distinctions between RL techniques employed in LLM alignment and those in conventional RL tasks. In particular, we highlight the necessity of constructing neural reward models from human data and discuss the formal and practical implications of this paradigm shift. We begin by introducing fundamental concepts in RL to provide a foundation for readers unfamiliar with the field. We then examine recent advances in this research agenda, discussing key challenges and opportunities in conducting IRL for LLM alignment. Beyond methodological considerations, we explore practical aspects, including datasets, benchmarks, evaluation metrics, infrastructure, and computationally efficient training and inference techniques. Finally, we draw insights from the literature on sparse-reward RL to identify open questions and potential research directions. By synthesizing findings from diverse studies, we aim to provide a structured and critical overview of the field, highlight unresolved challenges, and outline promising future directions for improving LLM alignment through RL and IRL techniques.

Abstract: Existing world models for autonomous driving struggle with long-horizon generation and generalization to challenging scenarios. In this work, we develop a model using simple design choices, and without additional supervision or sensors, such as maps, depth, or multiple cameras. We show that our model yields state-of-the-art performance, despite having only 469M parameters and being trained on 280h of video data. It particularly stands out in difficult scenarios like turning maneuvers and urban traffic. We test whether discrete token models possibly have advantages over continuous models based on flow matching. To this end, we set up a hybrid tokenizer that is compatible with both approaches and allows for a side-by-side comparison. Our study concludes in favor of the continuous autoregressive model, which is less brittle on individual design choices and more powerful than the model built on discrete tokens. Code, models and qualitative results are publicly available at https://lmb-freiburg.github.io/orbis.github.io/.

Over the last three years, these attacks have continued to pose a critical security threat to LLM-integrated systems. The emergence of agentic AI systems, where LLMs autonomously perform multistep tasks through tools and coordination with other agents, has fundamentally transformed the threat landscape. Modern prompt injection attacks can now combine with traditional cybersecurity exploits to create hybrid threats that systematically evade traditional security controls. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of Prompt Injection 2.0, examining how prompt injections integrate with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and other web security vulnerabilities to bypass traditional security measures. We build upon Preamble's foundational research and mitigation technologies, evaluating them against contemporary threats, including AI worms, multi-agent infections, and hybrid cyber-AI attacks. Our analysis incorporates recent benchmarks that demonstrate how traditional web application firewalls, XSS filters, and CSRF tokens fail against AI-enhanced attacks. We also present architectural solutions that combine prompt isolation, runtime security, and privilege separation with novel threat detection capabilities.

Abstract: Audio plays a crucial role in applications like speaker verification, voice-enabled smart devices, and audio conferencing. However, audio manipulations, such as deepfakes, pose significant risks by enabling the spread of misinformation. Our empirical analysis reveals that existing methods for detecting deepfake audio are often vulnerable to anti-forensic (AF) attacks, particularly those attacked using generative adversarial networks. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative learning method called SHIELD to defend against generative AF attacks. To expose AF signatures, we integrate an auxiliary generative model, called the defense (DF) generative model, which facilitates collaborative learning by combining input and output. Furthermore, we design a triplet model to capture correlations for real and AF attacked audios with real-generated and attacked-generated audios using auxiliary generative models. The proposed SHIELD strengthens the defense against generative AF attacks and achieves robust performance across various generative models. The proposed AF significantly reduces the average detection accuracy from 95.49% to 59.77% for ASVspoof2019, from 99.44% to 38.45% for In-the-Wild, and from 98.41% to 51.18% for HalfTruth for three different generative models. The proposed SHIELD mechanism is robust against AF attacks and achieves an average accuracy of 98.13%, 98.58%, and 99.57% in match, and 98.78%, 98.62%, and 98.85% in mismatch settings for the ASVspoof2019, In-the-Wild, and HalfTruth datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Conventional reinforcement learning (RL) ap proaches often struggle to learn effective policies under sparse reward conditions, necessitating the manual design of complex, task-specific reward functions. To address this limitation, rein forcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a promising strategy that complements hand-crafted rewards with human-derived evaluation signals. However, most existing RLHF methods depend on explicit feedback mechanisms such as button presses or preference labels, which disrupt the natural interaction process and impose a substantial cognitive load on the user. We propose a novel reinforcement learning from implicit human feedback (RLIHF) framework that utilizes non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) signals, specifically error-related potentials (ErrPs), to provide continuous, implicit feedback without requiring explicit user intervention. The proposed method adopts a pre-trained decoder to transform raw EEG signals into probabilistic reward components, en abling effective policy learning even in the presence of sparse external rewards. We evaluate our approach in a simulation environment built on the MuJoCo physics engine, using a Kinova Gen2 robotic arm to perform a complex pick-and-place task that requires avoiding obstacles while manipulating target objects. The results show that agents trained with decoded EEG feedback achieve performance comparable to those trained with dense, manually designed rewards. These findings validate the potential of using implicit neural feedback for scalable and human-aligned reinforcement learning in interactive robotics.

Abstract: While recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have substantially enhanced visual AI's capabilities, the challenge of inadequate data diversity and volume remains, particularly in construction domain. This study presents a novel image synthesis methodology tailored for construction worker detection, leveraging the generative-AI platform Midjourney. The approach entails generating a collection of 12,000 synthetic images by formulating 3000 different prompts, with an emphasis on image realism and diversity. These images, after manual labeling, serve as a dataset for DNN training. Evaluation on a real construction image dataset yielded promising results, with the model attaining average precisions (APs) of 0.937 and 0.642 at intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds of 0.5 and 0.5 to 0.95, respectively. Notably, the model demonstrated near-perfect performance on the synthetic dataset, achieving APs of 0.994 and 0.919 at the two mentioned thresholds. These findings reveal both the potential and weakness of generative AI in addressing DNN training data scarcity.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. On the other hand, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have been historically rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with $S^2M^2$: a global matching architecture that achieves both state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. $S^2M^2$ establishes a new state of the art on the Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods across most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.

<title>VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy</title>

Abstract: We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions (e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target, up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and 2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.

Abstract: Analogies test a model's ability to infer implicit relationships between concepts, making them a key benchmark for evaluating reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) are widely evaluated for reasoning in English, their abilities in Indic languages remain understudied, limiting our understanding of whether these models generalize across languages. To address this gap, we introduce a new Hindi Analogy Test Set (HATS), comprising 405 multiple-choice questions sourced from Indian government exams. We benchmark state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs using various prompting strategies and introduce a grounded Chain of Thought approach that leverages cognitive theories of analogical reasoning. This approach improves model performance on Hindi analogy questions. Our experiments show that models perform best with English prompts, irrespective of the prompting strategy. Our test set addresses the lack of a critical resource to evaluate LLM reasoning capabilities in Hindi.

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked powerful cross-modal reasoning abilities, but also raised new safety concerns, particularly when faced with adversarial multimodal inputs. To improve the safety of MLLMs during inference, we introduce a modular and adaptive inference-time intervention technology, AutoSteer, without requiring any fine-tuning of the underlying model. AutoSteer incorporates three core components: (1) a novel Safety Awareness Score (SAS) that automatically identifies the most safety-relevant distinctions among the model's internal layers; (2) an adaptive safety prober trained to estimate the likelihood of toxic outputs from intermediate representations; and (3) a lightweight Refusal Head that selectively intervenes to modulate generation when safety risks are detected. Experiments on LLaVA-OV and Chameleon across diverse safety-critical benchmarks demonstrate that AutoSteer significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) for textual, visual, and cross-modal threats, while maintaining general abilities. These findings position AutoSteer as a practical, interpretable, and effective framework for safer deployment of multimodal AI systems.

<title>Efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Vision Transformer underpinned by Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning Strategy</title>

Abstract: A prevalent approach in Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) involves freezing the majority of the backbone parameters and solely learning low-rank adaptation weight matrices to accommodate downstream tasks. These low-rank matrices are commonly derived through the multiplication structure of down-projection and up-projection matrices, exemplified by methods such as LoRA and Adapter. In this work, we observe an approximate orthogonality among any two row or column vectors within any weight matrix of the backbone parameters; however, this property is absent in the vectors of the down/up-projection matrices. Approximate orthogonality implies a reduction in the upper bound of the model's generalization error, signifying that the model possesses enhanced generalization capability. If the fine-tuned down/up-projection matrices were to exhibit this same property as the pre-trained backbone matrices, could the generalization capability of fine-tuned ViTs be further augmented? To address this question, we propose an Approximately Orthogonal Fine-Tuning (AOFT) strategy for representing the low-rank weight matrices. This strategy employs a single learnable vector to generate a set of approximately orthogonal vectors, which form the down/up-projection matrices, thereby aligning the properties of these matrices with those of the backbone. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance across a range of downstream image classification tasks, confirming the efficacy of the enhanced generalization capability embedded in the down/up-projection matrices.

<title>Merge Kernel for Bayesian Optimization on Permutation Space</title>

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm is a standard tool for black-box optimization problems. The current state-of-the-art BO approach for permutation spaces relies on the Mallows kernel-an $\Omega(n^2)$ representation that explicitly enumerates every pairwise comparison. Inspired by the close relationship between the Mallows kernel and pairwise comparison, we propose a novel framework for generating kernel functions on permutation space based on sorting algorithms. Within this framework, the Mallows kernel can be viewed as a special instance derived from bubble sort. Further, we introduce the \textbf{Merge Kernel} constructed from merge sort, which replaces the quadratic complexity with $\Theta(n\log n)$ to achieve the lowest possible complexity. The resulting feature vector is significantly shorter, can be computed in linearithmic time, yet still efficiently captures meaningful permutation distances. To boost robustness and right-invariance without sacrificing compactness, we further incorporate three lightweight, task-agnostic descriptors: (1) a shift histogram, which aggregates absolute element displacements and supplies a global misplacement signal; (2) a split-pair line, which encodes selected long-range comparisons by aligning elements across the two halves of the whole permutation; and (3) sliding-window motifs, which summarize local order patterns that influence near-neighbor objectives. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed kernel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Mallows kernel across various permutation optimization benchmarks. Results confirm that the Merge Kernel provides a more compact yet more effective solution for Bayesian optimization in permutation space.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key component in training large language reasoning models (LLMs). However, recent studies questions its effectiveness in improving multi-step reasoning-particularly on hard problems. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method, QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 67.1% (+5.3%) on AIME24, 59.5% (+10.0%) on AIME25, and 35.5% (+4.0%) on HMMT25. Further, we provide theoretical explanations that QuestA improves sample efficiency, offering a practical and generalizable pathway for expanding reasoning capability through RL.

Abstract: Advances in natural language processing and large language models are driving a major transformation in Human Capital Management, with a growing interest in building smart systems based on language technologies for talent acquisition, upskilling strategies, and workforce planning. However, the adoption and progress of these technologies critically depend on the development of reliable and fair models, properly evaluated on public data and open benchmarks, which have so far been unavailable in this domain.
  To address this gap, we present TalentCLEF 2025, the first evaluation campaign focused on skill and job title intelligence. The lab consists of two tasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish, German, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English. Both corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and manually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor market data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.
  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered the evaluation of gender bias.
  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most systems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual encoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them incorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking. The results show that the training strategies have a larger effect than the size of the model alone. TalentCLEF provides the first public benchmark in this field and encourages the development of robust, fair, and transferable language technologies for the labor market.

Abstract: Robots are increasingly integrated across industries, particularly in healthcare. However, many valuable applications for quadrupedal robots remain overlooked. This research explores the effectiveness of three reinforcement learning algorithms in training a simulated quadruped robot for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to develop a robotic guide dog simulation capable of path following and obstacle avoidance, with long-term potential for real-world assistance to guide dogs and visually impaired individuals. It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including robotic guide and alert dogs.
  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key evaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms, sensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor inputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to determine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex environments.
  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three algorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection. Results show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and median steps to goal per episode.
  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI and medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven quadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.

Abstract: In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However, LLMs often generate incorrect code that users need to fix and the literature suggests users often struggle to detect these errors. In this work we seek to offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees could improve the experience of using AI Code Assistants and potentially enable natural language programming for users with little or no programming knowledge. To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a formal query language that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. Then, using such a query we propose to verify LLM generated code to ensure it matches the user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the Ansible programming language which includes such a formal query language, a calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic interpreter which is used for the verification. On a benchmark suite of 21 code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.

Abstract: We introduce AbGen, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in designing ablation studies for scientific research. AbGen consists of 1,500 expert-annotated examples derived from 807 NLP papers. In this benchmark, LLMs are tasked with generating detailed ablation study designs for a specified module or process based on the given research context. Our evaluation of leading LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1-0528 and o4-mini, highlights a significant performance gap between these models and human experts in terms of the importance, faithfulness, and soundness of the ablation study designs. Moreover, we demonstrate that current automated evaluation methods are not reliable for our task, as they show a significant discrepancy when compared to human assessment. To better investigate this, we develop AbGen-Eval, a meta-evaluation benchmark designed to assess the reliability of commonly used automated evaluation systems in measuring LLM performance on our task. We investigate various LLM-as-Judge systems on AbGen-Eval, providing insights for future research on developing more effective and reliable LLM-based evaluation systems for complex scientific tasks.

Abstract: The reasoning-based pose estimation (RPE) benchmark has emerged as a widely adopted evaluation standard for pose-aware multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its significance, we identified critical reproducibility and benchmark-quality issues that hinder fair and consistent quantitative evaluations. Most notably, the benchmark utilizes different image indices from those of the original 3DPW dataset, forcing researchers into tedious and error-prone manual matching processes to obtain accurate ground-truth (GT) annotations for quantitative metrics (\eg, MPJPE, PA-MPJPE). Furthermore, our analysis reveals several inherent benchmark-quality limitations, including significant image redundancy, scenario imbalance, overly simplistic poses, and ambiguous textual descriptions, collectively undermining reliable evaluations across diverse scenarios. To alleviate manual effort and enhance reproducibility, we carefully refined the GT annotations through meticulous visual matching and publicly release these refined annotations as an open-source resource, thereby promoting consistent quantitative evaluations and facilitating future advancements in human pose-aware multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Does vision-and-language (VL) training change the linguistic representations of language models in meaningful ways? Most results in the literature have shown inconsistent or marginal differences, both behaviorally and representationally. In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs. a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task, even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.

Abstract: Learning visuomotor policies via imitation has proven effective across a wide range of robotic domains. However, the performance of these policies is heavily dependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive data collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data collection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging existing or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as public robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human data from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic flow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model (WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of robot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent Policy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by searching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real world experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of policies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement with 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50 demonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand episodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different robots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.

In this paper, we attempt to explore the causal factors for poor concept responses through elaborately designed experiments. We also design a concept-wise equalization loss function (IMBA loss) to address this issue. Our proposed method is online, eliminating the need for offline dataset processing, and requires minimal code changes. In our newly proposed complex concept benchmark Inert-CompBench and two other public test sets, our method significantly enhances the concept response capability of baseline models and yields highly competitive results with only a few codes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that selecting informative and relevant video frames can significantly improve the performance of Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs). Current methods, such as reducing inter-frame redundancy, employing separate models for image-text relevance assessment, or utilizing temporal video grounding for event localization, substantially adopt unsupervised learning paradigms, whereas they struggle to address the complex scenarios in long video understanding. We propose Instructed Temporal Grounding for Videos (VideoITG), featuring customized frame sampling aligned with user instructions. The core of VideoITG is the VidThinker pipeline, an automated annotation framework that explicitly mimics the human annotation process. First, it generates detailed clip-level captions conditioned on the instruction; then, it retrieves relevant video segments through instruction-guided reasoning; finally, it performs fine-grained frame selection to pinpoint the most informative visual evidence. Leveraging VidThinker, we construct the VideoITG-40K dataset, containing 40K videos and 500K instructed temporal grounding annotations. We then design a plug-and-play VideoITG model, which takes advantage of visual language alignment and reasoning capabilities of Video-LLMs, for effective frame selection in a discriminative manner. Coupled with Video-LLMs, VideoITG achieves consistent performance improvements across multiple multimodal video understanding benchmarks, showing its superiority and great potentials for video understanding.

Abstract: Graph recommendation methods, representing a connected interaction perspective, reformulate user-item interactions as graphs to leverage graph structure and topology to recommend and have proved practical effectiveness at scale. Large language models, representing a textual generative perspective, excel at modeling user languages, understanding behavioral contexts, capturing user-item semantic relationships, analyzing textual sentiments, and generating coherent and contextually relevant texts as recommendations. However, there is a gap between the connected graph perspective and the text generation perspective as the task formulations are different. A research question arises: how can we effectively integrate the two perspectives for more personalized recsys? To fill this gap, we propose to incorporate graph-edge information into LLMs via prompt and attention innovations. We reformulate recommendations as a probabilistic generative problem using prompts. We develop a framework to incorporate graph edge information from the prompt and attention mechanisms for graph-structured LLM recommendations. We develop a new prompt design that brings in both first-order and second-order graph relationships; we devise an improved LLM attention mechanism to embed direct the spatial and connectivity information of edges. Our evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to understand connectivity information in graph data and to improve the relevance and quality of recommendation results.

Abstract: MuZero has achieved superhuman performance in various games by using a dynamics network to predict the environment dynamics for planning, without relying on simulators. However, the latent states learned by the dynamics network make its planning process opaque. This paper aims to demystify MuZero's model by interpreting the learned latent states. We incorporate observation reconstruction and state consistency into MuZero training and conduct an in-depth analysis to evaluate latent states across two board games: 9x9 Go and Gomoku, and three Atari games: Breakout, Ms. Pacman, and Pong. Our findings reveal that while the dynamics network becomes less accurate over longer simulations, MuZero still performs effectively by using planning to correct errors. Our experiments also show that the dynamics network learns better latent states in board games than in Atari games. These insights contribute to a better understanding of MuZero and offer directions for future research to improve the performance, robustness, and interpretability of the MuZero algorithm.

Abstract: Modern web agents possess computer use abilities that allow them to interact with webpages by sending commands to a virtual keyboard and mouse. While such agents have considerable potential to assist human users with complex tasks, evaluating their capabilities in real-world settings poses a major challenge. To this end, we introduce BEARCUBS, a "small but mighty" benchmark of 111 information-seeking questions designed to evaluate a web agent's ability to search, browse, and identify factual information from the web. Unlike prior web agent benchmarks, solving BEARCUBS requires (1) accessing live web content rather than synthetic or simulated pages, which captures the unpredictability of real-world web interactions; and (2) performing a broad range of multimodal interactions (e.g., video understanding, 3D navigation) that cannot be bypassed via text-based workarounds. Each question in BEARCUBS has a corresponding short, unambiguous answer and a human-validated browsing trajectory, allowing for transparent evaluation of agent performance and strategies. A human study confirms that BEARCUBS questions are solvable but non-trivial (84.7% human accuracy), revealing domain knowledge gaps and overlooked details as common failure points. By contrast, state-of-the-art computer-using agents underperform, with the best-scoring system (OpenAI's Operator) reaching only 23.4% accuracy. These results highlight critical areas for improvement, including reliable source selection and more powerful multimodal capabilities. To facilitate future research, BEARCUBS will be updated periodically to replace invalid or contaminated questions, keeping the benchmark fresh for future generations of web agents.

Abstract: Large Action models are essential for enabling autonomous agents to perform complex tasks. However, training such models remains challenging due to the diversity of agent environments and the complexity of noisy agentic data. Existing infrastructure offers limited support for scalable, agent-specific fine-tuning and standardized agent data processing. We introduce ActionStudio, a lightweight and extensible data and training framework designed for large action models. ActionStudio unifies diverse agent trajectories using our proposed Unified Format 2.0, supports a range of training workflows with optimized multi-node distributed setup, and integrates robust preprocessing and real-time verification tools. ActionStudio demonstrates up to 9x higher throughput compared to existing agentic training frameworks, and our trained models yield top performances across public and realistic agent benchmarks. To support the broader research community, we open-source the ActionStudio framework and release actionstudio-98k, a curated dataset of 98k high-quality trajectories.

Abstract: LLM-as-Judge has emerged as a scalable alternative to human evaluation, enabling large language models (LLMs) to provide reward signals in trainings. While recent work has explored multi-agent extensions such as multi-agent debate and meta-judging to enhance evaluation quality, the question of how intrinsic biases manifest in these settings remains underexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of four diverse bias types: position bias, verbosity bias, chain-of-thought bias, and bandwagon bias. We evaluate these biases across two widely adopted multi-agent LLM-as-Judge frameworks: Multi-Agent-Debate and LLM-as-Meta-Judge. Our results show that debate framework amplifies biases sharply after the initial debate, and this increased bias is sustained in subsequent rounds, while meta-judge approaches exhibit greater resistance. We further investigate the incorporation of PINE, a leading single-agent debiasing method, as a bias-free agent within these systems. The results reveal that this bias-free agent effectively reduces biases in debate settings but provides less benefit in meta-judge scenarios. Our work provides a comprehensive study of bias behavior in multi-agent LLM-as-Judge systems and highlights the need for targeted bias mitigation strategies in collaborative evaluation settings.

Abstract: Balancing combat encounters in Dungeons & Dragons (D&amp;D) is a complex task that requires Dungeon Masters (DM) to manually assess party strength, enemy composition, and dynamic player interactions while avoiding interruption of the narrative flow. In this paper, we propose Encounter Generation via Reinforcement Learning (NTRL), a novel approach that automates Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) in D&amp;D via combat encounter design. By framing the problem as a contextual bandit, NTRL generates encounters based on real-time party members attributes. In comparison with classic DM heuristics, NTRL iteratively optimizes encounters to extend combat longevity (+200%), increases damage dealt to party members, reducing post-combat hit points (-16.67%), and raises the number of player deaths while maintaining low total party kills (TPK). The intensification of combat forces players to act wisely and engage in tactical maneuvers, even though the generated encounters guarantee high win rates (70%). Even in comparison with encounters designed by human Dungeon Masters, NTRL demonstrates superior performance by enhancing the strategic depth of combat while increasing difficulty in a manner that preserves overall game fairness.

Abstract: The gap between static benchmarks and the dynamic nature of real-world legal practice poses a key barrier to advancing legal intelligence. To this end, we introduce J1-ENVS, the first interactive and dynamic legal environment tailored for LLM-based agents. Guided by legal experts, it comprises six representative scenarios from Chinese legal practices across three levels of environmental complexity. We further introduce J1-EVAL, a fine-grained evaluation framework, designed to assess both task performance and procedural compliance across varying levels of legal proficiency. Extensive experiments on 17 LLM agents reveal that, while many models demonstrate solid legal knowledge, they struggle with procedural execution in dynamic settings. Even the SOTA model, GPT-4o, falls short of 60% overall performance. These findings highlight persistent challenges in achieving dynamic legal intelligence and offer valuable insights to guide future research.

<title>SmartThinker: Learning to Compress and Preserve Reasoning by Step-Level Length Control</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities through inference-time scaling, but this progress has also introduced considerable redundancy and inefficiency into their reasoning processes, resulting in substantial computational waste. Previous work has attempted to mitigate this issue by penalizing the overall length of generated samples during reinforcement learning (RL), with the goal of encouraging a more concise chains of thought. However, we observe that such global length penalty often lead to excessive compression of critical reasoning steps while preserving unnecessary details in simpler ones, yielding a suboptimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose SmartThinker, a two-stage learnable framework designed to enable fine-grained control over the length of reasoning chains based on the importance of each individual step. In the first stage, SmartThinker adapts a reasoning model to a short-form reasoning mode through rejection sampling combined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, SmartThinker applies Step-Level Length Control Policy Optimization (SCPO) to refine the model output distribution, which increases the proportion of length allocated to critical steps while reducing redundancy in less important ones. SCPO consists of four core components: an online importance estimator, a step-level length control reward function, a step-level generalized advantage estimation (S-GAE) and a difficulty-adaptive clipping strategy. Working in concert, these components enable SCPO to implement differentiated length control across reasoning steps. Empirical results across multiple reasoning benchmarks and various backbone models demonstrate that SmartThinker significantly reduces redundant reasoning while achieving comparable or even superior performance to existing methods.

Abstract: Engineers are deploying ML models as parts of real-world systems with the upsurge of AI technologies. Real-world environments challenge the deployment of such systems because these environments produce large amounts of heterogeneous data, and users require increasingly efficient responses. These requirements push prevalent software architectures to the limit when deploying ML-based systems. Data-oriented Architecture (DOA) is an emerging style that equips systems better for integrating ML models. Even though papers on deployed ML systems do not mention DOA, their authors made design decisions that implicitly follow DOA. Implicit decisions create a knowledge gap, limiting the practitioners' ability to implement ML-based systems. \hlb{This paper surveys why, how, and to what extent practitioners have adopted DOA to implement and deploy ML-based systems.} We overcome the knowledge gap by answering these questions and explicitly showing the design decisions and practices behind these systems. The survey follows a well-known systematic and semi-automated methodology for reviewing papers in software engineering. The majority of reviewed works partially adopt DOA. Such an adoption enables systems to address requirements such as Big Data management, low latency processing, resource management, security and privacy. Based on these findings, we formulate practical advice to facilitate the deployment of ML-based systems.

Abstract: APT detection is difficult to detect due to the long-term latency, covert and slow multistage attack patterns of Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). To tackle these issues, we propose TBDetector, a transformer-based advanced persistent threat detection method for APT attack detection. Considering that provenance graphs provide rich historical information and have the powerful attacks historic correlation ability to identify anomalous activities, TBDetector employs provenance analysis for APT detection, which summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency and utilizes transformer with self-attention based encoder-decoder to extract long-term contextual features of system states to detect slow-acting attacks. Furthermore, we further introduce anomaly scores to investigate the anomaly of different system states, where each state is calculated with an anomaly score corresponding to its similarity score and isolation score. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we have conducted experiments on five public datasets, i.e., streamspot, cadets, shellshock, clearscope, and wget_baseline. Experimental results and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have exhibited better performance of our proposed method.

Abstract: The exploration of new problem classes for quantum computation is an active area of research. In this paper, we introduce and solve a novel problem class related to dynamics on large-scale networks relevant to neurobiology and machine learning. Specifically, we ask if a network can sustain inherent dynamic activity beyond some arbitrary observation time or if the activity ceases through quiescence or saturation via an epileptic-like state. We show that this class of problems can be formulated and structured to take advantage of quantum superposition and solved efficiently using a coupled workflow between the Grover and Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms. To do so, we extend their functionality to address the unique requirements of how input (sub)sets into the algorithms must be mathematically structured while simultaneously constructing the inputs so that measurement outputs can be interpreted as meaningful properties of the network dynamics. This, in turn, allows us to answer the question we pose.

Abstract: The increasing interest in developing Artificial Intelligence applications in the medical domain, suffers from the lack of high-quality data set, mainly due to privacy-related issues. In addition, the recent increase in Vision Language Models (VLM) leads to the need for multimodal medical data sets, where clinical reports and findings are attached to the corresponding medical scans. This paper illustrates the entire workflow for building the MedPix 2.0 data set. Starting with the well-known multimodal data set MedPix\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, mainly used by physicians, nurses, and healthcare students for Continuing Medical Education purposes, a semi-automatic pipeline was developed to extract visual and textual data followed by a manual curing procedure in which noisy samples were removed, thus creating a MongoDB database. Along with the data set, we developed a Graphical User Interface aimed at navigating efficiently the MongoDB instance and obtaining the raw data that can be easily used for training and/or fine-tuning VLMs. To enforce this point, in this work, we first recall DR-Minerva, a Retrieve Augmented Generation-based VLM model trained upon MedPix 2.0. DR-Minerva predicts the body part and the modality used to scan its input image. We also propose the extension of DR-Minerva with a Knowledge Graph that uses Llama 3.1 Instruct 8B, and leverages MedPix 2.0. The resulting architecture can be queried in a end-to-end manner, as a medical decision support system. MedPix 2.0 is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The use of AI technologies is being integrated into the secure development of software-based systems, with an increasing trend of composing AI-based subsystems (with uncertain levels of performance) into automated pipelines. This presents a fundamental research challenge and seriously threatens safety-critical domains. Despite the existing knowledge about uncertainty in risk analysis, no previous work has estimated the uncertainty of AI-augmented systems given the propagation of errors in the pipeline. We provide the formal underpinnings for capturing uncertainty propagation, develop a simulator to quantify uncertainty, and evaluate the simulation of propagating errors with one case study. We discuss the generalizability of our approach and its limitations and present recommendations for evaluation policies concerning AI systems. Future work includes extending the approach by relaxing the remaining assumptions and by experimenting with a real system.

Abstract: Music classification, a cornerstone of music information retrieval, supports a wide array of applications. To address the lack of comprehensive datasets and effective methods for sub-genre classification in mainstage dance music, we introduce a novel benchmark featuring a new dataset and baseline. Our dataset expands the scope of sub-genres to reflect the diversity of recent mainstage live sets performed by leading DJs at global music festivals, capturing the vibrant and rapidly evolving electronic dance music (EDM) scene that engages millions of fans worldwide. We employ a continuous soft labeling approach to accommodate tracks blending multiple sub-genres, preserving their inherent complexity. Experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with this task, while our specialized baseline models achieve high accuracy. This benchmark supports applications such as music recommendation, DJ set curation, and interactive multimedia systems, with video demos provided.

Abstract: LLMs are ideal for decision-making thanks to their ability to reason over long contexts. However, challenges arise when processing speech transcripts that describe complex scenarios, as they are verbose and include repetition, hedging, and vagueness. E.g., during a company's earnings call, an executive might project a positive revenue outlook to reassure investors, despite uncertainty regarding future earnings. It is crucial for LLMs to incorporate this uncertainty systematically when making decisions. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{DeFine}, a modular framework that constructs probabilistic factor profiles from complex scenarios. It then integrates these profiles with analogical reasoning, leveraging insights from similar past experiences to guide LLMs in making critical decisions in new situations. Our framework separates the tasks of quantifying uncertainty and incorporating it into LLM decision-making. This approach is particularly useful in areas such as consulting and financial deliberation, where making decisions under uncertainty is vital.

Abstract: The success of multi-task learning can depend heavily on which tasks are grouped together. Naively grouping all tasks or a random set of tasks can result in negative transfer, with the multi-task models performing worse than single-task models. Though many efforts have been made to identify task groupings and to measure the relatedness among different tasks, it remains a challenging research topic to define a metric to identify the best task grouping out of a pool of many potential task combinations. We propose a metric of task relatedness based on task difficulty measured by pointwise V-usable information (PVI). PVI is a recently proposed metric to estimate how much usable information a dataset contains given a model. We hypothesize that tasks with not statistically different PVI estimates are similar enough to benefit from the joint learning process. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the feasibility of this metric for task grouping on 15 NLP datasets in the general, biomedical, and clinical domains. We compare the results of the joint learners against single learners, existing baseline methods, and recent large language models, including Llama 2 and GPT-4. The results show that by grouping tasks with similar PVI estimates, the joint learners yielded competitive results with fewer total parameters, with consistent performance across domains.

Abstract: Low-rank adaption (LoRA) is a widely used parameter-efficient finetuning method for LLM that reduces memory requirements. However, current LoRA optimizers lack transformation invariance, meaning the actual updates to the weights depends on how the two LoRA factors are scaled or rotated. This deficiency leads to inefficient learning and sub-optimal solutions in practice. This paper introduces LoRA-RITE, a novel adaptive matrix preconditioning method for LoRA optimization, which can achieve transformation invariance and remain computationally efficient. We provide theoretical analysis to demonstrate the benefit of our method and conduct experiments on various LLM tasks with different models including Gemma 2B, 7B, and mT5-XXL. The results demonstrate consistent improvements against existing optimizers. For example, replacing Adam with LoRA-RITE during LoRA fine-tuning of Gemma-2B yielded 4.6\% accuracy gain on Super-Natural Instructions and 3.5\% accuracy gain across other four LLM benchmarks (HellaSwag, ArcChallenge, GSM8K, OpenBookQA).

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance in vision-language reasoning, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) might generate hallucinated contents that do not exist in the given image. Most existing LVLM hallucination benchmarks are constrained to evaluate the object-related hallucinations. However, the potential hallucination on the relations between two objects, i.e., relation hallucination, still lacks investigation. To remedy that, we design a unified framework to measure the object and relation hallucination in LVLMs simultaneously. The core idea of our framework is to evaluate hallucinations via (object, relation, object) triplets extracted from LVLMs' responses, making it easily generalizable to different vision-language tasks. Based on our framework, we further introduce Tri-HE, a novel Triplet-level Hallucination Evaluation benchmark which can be used to study both object and relation hallucination at the same time. With comprehensive evaluations on Tri-HE, we observe that the relation hallucination issue is even more serious than object hallucination among existing LVLMs, highlighting a previously neglected problem towards reliable LVLMs. Moreover, based on our findings, we design a simple training-free approach that effectively mitigates hallucinations for LVLMs. Our dataset and code for the reproduction of our experiments are available publicly at https://github.com/wujunjie1998/Tri-HE.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dataset that is the result of a user study on the comprehensibility of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) algorithms. The study participants were recruited from 149 candidates to form three groups representing experts in the domain of mycology (DE), students with a data science and visualization background (IT) and students from social sciences and humanities (SSH). The main part of the dataset contains 39 transcripts of interviews during which participants were asked to complete a series of tasks and questions related to the interpretation of explanations of decisions of a machine learning model trained to distinguish between edible and inedible mushrooms. The transcripts were complemented with additional data that includes visualizations of explanations presented to the user, results from thematic analysis, recommendations of improvements of explanations provided by the participants, and the initial survey results that allow to determine the domain knowledge of the participant and data analysis literacy. The transcripts were manually tagged to allow for automatic matching between the text and other data related to particular fragments. In the advent of the area of rapid development of XAI techniques, the need for a multidisciplinary qualitative evaluation of explainability is one of the emerging topics in the community. Our dataset allows not only to reproduce the study we conducted, but also to open a wide range of possibilities for the analysis of the material we gathered.

<title>Out-of-Distribution Recovery with Object-Centric Keypoint Inverse Policy for Visuomotor Imitation Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03294</link>

Abstract: We propose an object-centric recovery (OCR) framework to address the challenges of out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios in visuomotor policy learning. Previous behavior cloning (BC) methods rely heavily on a large amount of labeled data coverage, failing in unfamiliar spatial states. Without relying on extra data collection, our approach learns a recovery policy constructed by an inverse policy inferred from the object keypoint manifold gradient in the original training data. The recovery policy serves as a simple add-on to any base visuomotor BC policy, agnostic to a specific method, guiding the system back towards the training distribution to ensure task success even in OOD situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our object-centric framework in both simulation and real robot experiments, achieving an improvement of 77.7\% over the base policy in OOD. Furthermore, we show OCR's capacity to autonomously collect demonstrations for continual learning. Overall, we believe this framework represents a step toward improving the robustness of visuomotor policies in real-world settings.

<title>IOPO: Empowering LLMs with Complex Instruction Following via Input-Output Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: In the realm of large language models (LLMs), the ability of models to accurately follow instructions is paramount as more agents and applications leverage LLMs for construction, where the complexity of instructions are rapidly increasing. However, on the one hand, there is only a certain amount of complex instruction evaluation data; on the other hand, there are no dedicated algorithms to improve the ability to follow complex instructions. To this end, this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.

Abstract: Training medical image segmentation models for rare yet clinically important imaging modalities is challenging due to the scarcity of annotated data, and manual mask annotations can be costly and labor-intensive to acquire. This paper investigates leveraging generative models to synthesize data, for training segmentation models for underrepresented modalities, particularly on annotation-scarce MRI. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce MRGen-DB, a large-scale radiology image-text dataset comprising extensive samples with rich metadata, including modality labels, attributes, regions, and organs information, with a subset featuring pixel-wise mask annotations; (ii) we present MRGen, a diffusion-based data engine for controllable medical image synthesis, conditioned on text prompts and segmentation masks. MRGen can generate realistic images for diverse MRI modalities lacking mask annotations, facilitating segmentation training in low-source domains; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that MRGen significantly improves segmentation performance on unannotated modalities by providing high-quality synthetic data. We believe that our method bridges a critical gap in medical image analysis, extending segmentation capabilities to scenarios that are challenging to acquire manual annotations. The codes, models, and data will be publicly available at https://haoningwu3639.github.io/MRGen/

Abstract: Detecting synthetic from real speech is increasingly crucial due to the risks of misinformation and identity impersonation. While various datasets for synthetic speech analysis have been developed, they often focus on specific areas, limiting their utility for comprehensive research. To fill this gap, we propose the Speech-Forensics dataset by extensively covering authentic, synthetic, and partially forged speech samples that include multiple segments synthesized by different high-quality algorithms. Moreover, we propose a TEmporal Speech LocalizaTion network, called TEST, aiming at simultaneously performing authenticity detection, multiple fake segments localization, and synthesis algorithms recognition, without any complex post-processing. TEST effectively integrates LSTM and Transformer to extract more powerful temporal speech representations and utilizes dense prediction on multi-scale pyramid features to estimate the synthetic spans. Our model achieves an average mAP of 83.55% and an EER of 5.25% at the utterance level. At the segment level, it attains an EER of 1.07% and a 92.19% F1 score. These results highlight the model's robust capability for a comprehensive analysis of synthetic speech, offering a promising avenue for future research and practical applications in this field.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable photometric redshift determination is one of the key aspects for wide-field photometric surveys. Determination of photometric redshift for galaxies, has been traditionally solved by use of machine-learning and artificial intelligence techniques trained on a calibration sample of galaxies, where both photometry and spectrometry are available. On this paper, we present a new algorithmic approach for determining photometric redshifts of galaxies using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs). The proposed implementation is able to determine both point-estimation and probability-density estimations for photometric redshifts. The methodology is tested with data from Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y1 data and compared with other existing algorithm such as a Mixture Density Network (MDN). Although results obtained show a superiority of MDN, CGAN quality-metrics are close to the MDN results, opening the door to the use of CGAN at photometric redshift estimation.

<title>SIDDA: SInkhorn Dynamic Domain Adaptation for Image Classification with Equivariant Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Modern neural networks (NNs) often do not generalize well in the presence of a "covariate shift"; that is, in situations where the training and test data distributions differ, but the conditional distribution of classification labels remains unchanged. In such cases, NN generalization can be reduced to a problem of learning more domain-invariant features. Domain adaptation (DA) methods include a range of techniques aimed at achieving this; however, these methods have struggled with the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning, which then incurs significant computational costs. In this work, we introduce SIDDA, an out-of-the-box DA training algorithm built upon the Sinkhorn divergence, that can achieve effective domain alignment with minimal hyperparameter tuning and computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple simulated and real datasets of varying complexity, including simple shapes, handwritten digits, and real astronomical observations. SIDDA is compatible with a variety of NN architectures, and it works particularly well in improving classification accuracy and model calibration when paired with equivariant neural networks (ENNs). We find that SIDDA enhances the generalization capabilities of NNs, achieving up to a $\approx40\%$ improvement in classification accuracy on unlabeled target data. We also study the efficacy of DA on ENNs with respect to the varying group orders of the dihedral group $D_N$, and find that the model performance improves as the degree of equivariance increases. Finally, we find that SIDDA enhances model calibration on both source and target data--achieving over an order of magnitude improvement in the ECE and Brier score. SIDDA's versatility, combined with its automated approach to domain alignment, has the potential to advance multi-dataset studies by enabling the development of highly generalizable models.

<title>LLM-RecG: A Semantic Bias-Aware Framework for Zero-Shot Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot cross-domain sequential recommendation (ZCDSR) enables predictions in unseen domains without additional training or fine-tuning, addressing the limitations of traditional models in sparse data environments. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced ZCDSR by facilitating cross-domain knowledge transfer through rich, pretrained representations. Despite this progress, domain semantic bias -- arising from differences in vocabulary and content focus between domains -- remains a persistent challenge, leading to misaligned item embeddings and reduced generalization across domains. To address this, we propose a novel semantic bias-aware framework that enhances LLM-based ZCDSR by improving cross-domain alignment at both the item and sequential levels. At the item level, we introduce a generalization loss that aligns the embeddings of items across domains (inter-domain compactness), while preserving the unique characteristics of each item within its own domain (intra-domain diversity). This ensures that item embeddings can be transferred effectively between domains without collapsing into overly generic or uniform representations. At the sequential level, we develop a method to transfer user behavioral patterns by clustering source domain user sequences and applying attention-based aggregation during target domain inference. We dynamically adapt user embeddings to unseen domains, enabling effective zero-shot recommendations without requiring target-domain interactions...

Abstract: We present three improvements to the standard model-based RL paradigm based on transformers: (a) "Dyna with warmup", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, but only starts using imaginary data after the world model has been sufficiently trained; (b) "nearest neighbor tokenizer" for image patches, which improves upon previous tokenization schemes, which are needed when using a transformer world model (TWM), by ensuring the code words are static after creation, thus providing a constant target for TWM learning; and (c) "block teacher forcing", which allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep, instead of generating them sequentially. We then show that our method significantly improves upon prior methods in various environments. We mostly focus on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, where our method achieves a reward of 69.66% after only 1M environment steps, significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and exceeding human performance of 65.0% for the first time. We also show preliminary results on Craftax-full, MinAtar, and three different two-player games, to illustrate the generality of the approach.

Abstract: User specifications or legal frameworks often require information to be removed from pretrained models, including large language models (LLMs). This requires deleting or "forgetting" a set of data points from an already-trained model, which typically degrades its performance on other data points. Thus, a balance must be struck between removing information and keeping the model's other abilities intact, with a failure to balance this trade-off leading to poor deletion or an unusable model. To this end, we propose UPCORE (Utility-Preserving Coreset Selection), a method-agnostic data selection framework for mitigating collateral damage during unlearning. Finding that the model damage is correlated with the variance of the model's representations on the forget set, we selectively prune the forget set to remove outliers, thereby minimizing model degradation after unlearning. Across three standard unlearning methods, UPCORE consistently achieves a superior balance between the competing objectives of deletion efficacy and model preservation. To better evaluate this trade-off, we introduce a new metric, measuring the area-under-the-curve (AUC) across standard metrics. Our results show that UPCORE improves both standard metrics and AUC, benefiting from positive transfer between the coreset and pruned points while reducing negative transfer from the forget set to points outside of it.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology is profoundly transforming human society and concurrently presenting a series of ethical, legal, and social issues. The effective governance of AI has become a crucial global concern. Since 2022, the extensive deployment of generative AI, particularly large language models, marked a new phase in AI governance. Continuous efforts are being made by the international community in actively addressing the novel challenges posed by these AI developments. As consensus on international governance continues to be established and put into action, the practical importance of conducting a global assessment of the state of AI governance is progressively coming to light. In this context, we initiated the development of the AI Governance InternationaL Evaluation Index (AGILE Index). Adhering to the design principle, "the level of governance should match the level of development," the inaugural evaluation of the AGILE Index commences with an exploration of four foundational pillars: the development level of AI, the AI governance environment, the AI governance instruments, and the AI governance effectiveness. It covers 39 indicators across 18 dimensions to comprehensively assess the AI governance level of 14 representative countries globally. The index is utilized to delve into the status of AI governance to date in 14 countries for the first batch of evaluation. The aim is to depict the current state of AI governance in these countries through data scoring, assist them in identifying their governance stage and uncovering governance issues, and ultimately offer insights for the enhancement of their AI governance systems.

Abstract: The analysis of high-dimensional timeline data and the identification of outliers and anomalies is critical across diverse domains, including sensor readings, biological and medical data, historical records, and global statistics. However, conventional analysis techniques often struggle with challenges such as high dimensionality, complex distributions, and sparsity. These limitations hinder the ability to extract meaningful insights from complex temporal datasets, making it difficult to identify trending features, outliers, and anomalies effectively. Inspired by surprisability -- a cognitive science concept describing how humans instinctively focus on unexpected deviations - we propose Learning via Surprisability (LvS), a novel approach for transforming high-dimensional timeline data. LvS quantifies and prioritizes anomalies in time-series data by formalizing deviations from expected behavior. LvS bridges cognitive theories of attention with computational methods, enabling the detection of anomalies and shifts in a way that preserves critical context, offering a new lens for interpreting complex datasets. We demonstrate the usefulness of LvS on three high-dimensional timeline use cases: a time series of sensor data, a global dataset of mortality causes over multiple years, and a textual corpus containing over two centuries of State of the Union Addresses by U.S. presidents. Our results show that the LvS transformation enables efficient and interpretable identification of outliers, anomalies, and the most variable features along the timeline.

Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.

arXiv:2503.12989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that our framework not only enhances occupation and skill classification tasks, but also provides a cost-effective alternative to frontier models like GPT-4o, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.

Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlow-SLAM, a robust and effective Tightly-Coupled RGBD-inertial SLAM for legged robotics undergoing aggressive and high-frequency motions.By integrating geometric consistency, legged odometry constraints, and dual-stream optical flow (GeoFlow), our method addresses three critical challenges:feature matching and pose initialization failures during fast locomotion and visual feature scarcity in texture-less scenes.Specifically, in rapid motion scenarios, feature matching is notably enhanced by leveraging dual-stream optical flow, which combines prior map points and poses. Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry, inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments. The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged robots and open-source datasets. To further promote research and development, the open-source datasets and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/geoflow-slam

Abstract: Human mobility modeling is critical for urban planning and transportation management, yet existing approaches often lack the integration capabilities needed to handle diverse data sources. We present a foundation model framework for universal human mobility patterns that leverages cross-domain data fusion and large language models to address these limitations. Our approach integrates multi-modal data of distinct nature and spatio-temporal resolution, including geographical, mobility, socio-demographic, and traffic information, to construct a privacy-preserving and semantically enriched human travel trajectory dataset. Our framework demonstrates adaptability through domain transfer techniques that ensure transferability across diverse urban contexts, as evidenced in case studies of Los Angeles (LA) and Egypt. The framework employs LLMs for semantic enrichment of trajectory data, enabling comprehensive understanding of mobility patterns. Quantitative evaluation shows that our generated synthetic dataset accurately reproduces mobility patterns observed in empirical data. The practical utility of this foundation model approach is demonstrated through large-scale traffic simulations for LA County, where results align well with observed traffic data. On California's I-405 corridor, the simulation yields a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 5.85% for traffic volume and 4.36% for speed compared to Caltrans PeMS observations, illustrating the framework's potential for intelligent transportation systems and urban mobility applications.

Abstract: This study presents an enhanced multi-fidelity Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) framework for efficient spatio-temporal flow field prediction when high-fidelity data is scarce. Key innovations include: a merge network replacing traditional dot-product operations, achieving 50.4% reduction in prediction error and 7.57% accuracy improvement while reducing training time by 96%; a transfer learning multi-fidelity approach that freezes pre-trained low-fidelity networks while making only the merge network trainable, outperforming alternatives by up to 76% and achieving 43.7% better accuracy than single-fidelity training; and a physics-guided subsampling method that strategically selects high-fidelity training points based on temporal dynamics, reducing high-fidelity sample requirements by 40% while maintaining comparable accuracy. Comprehensive experiments across multiple resolutions and datasets demonstrate the framework's ability to significantly reduce required high-fidelity dataset size while maintaining predictive accuracy, with consistent superior performance against conventional benchmarks.

Abstract: Popular PEFT methods reduce trainable parameter count for fine-tuning by parameterizing new low-rank or sparse trainable weights in parallel to the frozen pre-trained weights $W$. However, these weights are trained from scratch, and there exists a performance gap between these methods and full fine-tuning, especially in low-budget settings. We introduce VectorFit, a new way of parameterization that efficiently utilizes the existing knowledge embedded in $W$ by adaptively training their singular vectors and biases. We show that utilizing the structural and transformational properties of $W$ in this way can lead to high-rank incremental weight matrices $\Delta W$, comparable to that of full fine-tuning. VectorFit delivers superior results with \textbf{9$\boldsymbol\times$} fewer trainable parameters than the leading PEFT methods. Through comprehensive experiments across 19 datasets covering a wide range of language and vision tasks such as natural language understanding and generation, question answering, image classification, and image generation, we demonstrate that VectorFit surpasses baselines in terms of performance as a function of parameter-efficiency.

Extending recent time-optimal constant-$\theta$ control results, we integrate Cartan methods into equivariant quantum neural network (EQNN) for quantum control tasks. We show that a finite-depth limited EQNN ansatz equipped with Cartan layers can replicate the constant-$\theta$ sub-Riemannian geodesics for K-P problems. We demonstrate how for certain classes of control problem on Riemannian symmetric spaces, gradient-based training using an appropriate cost function converges to certain global time-optimal solutions when satisfying simple regularity conditions. This generalises prior geometric control theory methods and clarifies how optimal geodesic estimation can be performed in quantum machine learning contexts.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks but also pose significant risks of generating harmful content, particularly through jailbreak attacks. Jailbreak attacks refer to intentional manipulations that bypass safety mechanisms in models, leading to the generation of inappropriate or unsafe content. Detecting such attacks is critical to ensuring the responsible deployment of MLLMs. Existing jailbreak detection methods face three primary challenges: (1) Many rely on model hidden states or gradients, limiting their applicability to white-box models, where the internal workings of the model are accessible; (2) They involve high computational overhead from uncertainty-based analysis, which limits real-time detection, and (3) They require fully labeled harmful datasets, which are often scarce in real-world settings. To address these issues, we introduce a test-time adaptive framework called JAILDAM. Our method leverages a memory-based approach guided by policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations, eliminating the need for explicit exposure to harmful data. By dynamically updating unsafe knowledge during test-time, our framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on multiple VLM jailbreak benchmarks demonstrate that JAILDAM delivers state-of-the-art performance in harmful content detection, improving both accuracy and speed.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) reduces a model's memory footprint by mapping full precision weights into low bit weights without costly retraining, but can degrade its downstream performance especially in low 2- to 3-bit settings. We develop a new mixed-precision PTQ approach, Task-Circuit Quantization (TaCQ), that draws parallels to automated circuit discovery, directly conditioning the quantization process on specific weight circuits -- which we define as sets of weights associated with downstream task performance. These weights are kept as 16-bit weights, while others are quantized, maintaining performance while only adding a marginal memory cost. Specifically, TaCQ contrasts unquantized model weights with a uniformly-quantized model to estimate the expected change in weights due to quantization and uses gradient information to predict the resulting impact on task performance, allowing us to preserve task-specific weights. We compare TaCQ-based quantization to existing mixed-precision quantization methods when conditioning both on general-purpose and task-specific data. Across QA, math reasoning, and text-to-SQL tasks for both Llama-3 and Qwen2.5, we find that TaCQ outperforms baselines using the same calibration data and a lower weight budget, achieving major improvements in the 2 and 3-bit regime. With only 3.1 bits we are able to recover 96% of Llama-3-8B-Instruct's unquantized 16-bit MMLU performance, obtaining a 5.25% absolute improvement over SPQR. We also observe consistently large gains over existing methods in the 2-bit regime, with an average gain of 14.74% over the strongest baseline, SliM-LLM. Moreover, we observe a 7.20% gain without conditioning on specific tasks, showing TaCQ's ability to identify important weights is not limited to task-conditioned settings.

Abstract: Unstructured clinical data can serve as a unique and rich source of information that can meaningfully inform clinical practice. Extracting the most pertinent context from such data is critical for exploiting its true potential toward optimal and timely decision-making in patient care. While prior research has explored various methods for clinical text summarization, most prior studies either process all input tokens uniformly or rely on heuristic-based filters, which can overlook nuanced clinical cues and fail to prioritize information critical for decision-making. In this study, we propose Contextual, a novel framework that integrates a Context-Preserving Token Filtering method with a Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph (KG) for contextual augmentation. By preserving context-specific important tokens and enriching them with structured knowledge, ConTextual improves both linguistic coherence and clinical fidelity. Our extensive empirical evaluations on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConTextual consistently outperforms other baselines. Our proposed approach highlights the complementary role of token-level filtering and structured retrieval in enhancing both linguistic and clinical integrity, as well as offering a scalable solution for improving precision in clinical text generation.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in the field of distributed machine learning, enabling multiple clients such as mobile devices, edge nodes, or organizations to collaboratively train a shared global model without the need to centralize sensitive data. This decentralized approach addresses growing concerns around data privacy, security, and regulatory compliance, making it particularly attractive in domains such as healthcare, finance, and smart IoT systems. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of Federated Learning, beginning with its core architecture and communication protocol. We discuss the standard FL lifecycle, including local training, model aggregation, and global updates. A particular emphasis is placed on key technical challenges such as handling non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed) data, mitigating system and hardware heterogeneity, reducing communication overhead, and ensuring privacy through mechanisms like differential privacy and secure aggregation. Furthermore, we examine emerging trends in FL research, including personalized FL, cross-device versus cross-silo settings, and integration with other paradigms such as reinforcement learning and quantum computing. We also highlight real-world applications and summarize benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics commonly used in FL research. Finally, we outline open research problems and future directions to guide the development of scalable, efficient, and trustworthy FL systems.

Abstract: With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), the issue of generating non-existing facts, known as hallucination, has garnered increasing attention. Previous research in enhancing LLM confidence estimation mainly focuses on the single problem setting. However, LLM awareness of its internal parameterized knowledge boundary under the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires answering multiple problems accurately simultaneously, remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel method, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25% in average precision.

Abstract: Personalizing Stable Diffusion for professional portrait generation from amateur photos faces challenges in maintaining facial resemblance. This paper evaluates the impact of augmentation strategies on two personalization methods: DreamBooth and InstantID. We compare classical augmentations (flipping, cropping, color adjustments) with generative augmentation using InstantID's synthetic images to enrich training data. Using SDXL and a new FaceDistance metric based on FaceNet, we quantitatively assess facial similarity. Results show classical augmentations can cause artifacts harming identity retention, while InstantID improves fidelity when balanced with real images to avoid overfitting. A user study with 97 participants confirms high photorealism and preferences for InstantID's polished look versus DreamBooth's identity accuracy. Our findings inform effective augmentation strategies for personalized text-to-image generation.

Abstract: As LLMs grow in complexity, achieving state-of-the-art performance requires tight co-design across algorithms, software, and hardware. Today's reliance on a single dominant platform limits portability, creates vendor lock-in, and raises barriers for new AI hardware. In this work, we make the case for combining just-in-time (JIT) compilation with comprehensive kernel parameter autotuning to enable portable LLM inference with state-of-the-art performance without code changes. Focusing on performance-critical LLM kernels, we demonstrate that this approach explores up to 15x more kernel parameter configurations, produces significantly more diverse code across multiple dimensions, and even outperforms vendor-optimized implementations by up to 230%, all while reducing kernel code size by 70x and eliminating manual code optimizations. Our results highlight autotuning as a promising path to unlocking model portability across GPU vendors.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot abilities and powerful image-understanding capabilities. However, the existing open-source multi-modal models suffer from the weak capability of multi-turn interaction, especially for long contexts. To address the issue, we first introduce a context modeling module, termed ContextQFormer, which utilizes a memory block to enhance the presentation of contextual information. Furthermore, to facilitate further research, we carefully build a new multi-turn multi-modal dialogue dataset (TMDialog) for pre-training, instruction-tuning, and evaluation, which will be open-sourced lately. Compared with other multi-modal dialogue datasets, TMDialog contains longer conversations, which supports the research of multi-turn multi-modal dialogue. In addition, ContextQFormer is compared with three baselines on TMDialog and experimental results illustrate that ContextQFormer achieves an improvement of 2%-4% in available rate over baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results, fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic error analysis to reveal model limitations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without actually tuning hyperparameters.

<title>MEM1: Learning to Synergize Memory and Reasoning for Efficient Long-Horizon Agents</title>

Abstract: Modern language agents must operate over long-horizon, multi-turn interactions, where they retrieve external information, adapt to observations, and answer interdependent queries. Yet, most LLM systems rely on full-context prompting, appending all past turns regardless of their relevance. This leads to unbounded memory growth, increased computational costs, and degraded reasoning performance on out-of-distribution input lengths. We introduce MEM1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to operate with constant memory across long multi-turn tasks. At each turn, MEM1 updates a compact shared internal state that jointly supports memory consolidation and reasoning. This state integrates prior memory with new observations from the environment while strategically discarding irrelevant or redundant information. To support training in more realistic and compositional settings, we propose a simple yet effective and scalable approach to constructing multi-turn environments by composing existing datasets into arbitrarily complex task sequences. Experiments across three domains, including internal retrieval QA, open-domain web QA, and multi-turn web shopping, show that MEM1-7B improves performance by 3.5x while reducing memory usage by 3.7x compared to Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct on a 16-objective multi-hop QA task, and generalizes beyond the training horizon. Our results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven memory consolidation as a scalable alternative to existing solutions for training long-horizon interactive agents, where both efficiency and performance are optimized.

<title>Semantic Structure-Aware Generative Attacks for Enhanced Adversarial Transferability</title>

Abstract: Generative adversarial attacks train a perturbation generator on a white-box surrogate model and subsequently apply the crafted perturbations to unseen black-box victim models. In contrast to iterative attacks, these methods deliver superior inference-time efficiency, scalability, and transferability; however, up until now, existing studies have not fully exploited the representational capacity of generative models to preserve and harness semantic information. Specifically, the intermediate activations of the generator encode rich semantic features--object boundaries and coarse shapes--that remain under-exploited, thereby limiting the alignment of perturbations with object-salient regions which are critical for adversarial transferability. To remedy this, we introduce a semantic structure-aware attack framework based on the Mean Teacher, which serves as a temporally smoothed feature reference. With this smoothed reference, we further direct semantic consistency between the early-layer activations in the student and those of the semantically rich teacher by feature distillation. By anchoring perturbation synthesis to the semantically salient early intermediate blocks within the generator based on empirical findings, our method guides progressive adversarial perturbation on regions that substantially enhance adversarial transferability. We conduct extensive experiments over diverse models, domains and tasks to demonstrate consistent improvements relative to state-of-the-art generative attacks, comprehensively evaluated using conventional metrics and our newly proposed Accidental Correction Rate (ACR).

arXiv:2506.20040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering emergent concepts across transformer layers remains a significant challenge because the residual stream linearly mixes and duplicates information, obscuring how features evolve within large language models. Current research efforts primarily inspect neural representations at single layers, thereby overlooking this cross-layer superposition and the redundancy it introduces. These representations are typically either analyzed directly for activation patterns or passed to probing classifiers that map them to a limited set of predefined concepts. To address these limitations, we propose cross-layer VQ-VAE (CLVQ-VAE), a framework that uses vector quantization to map representations across layers and in the process collapse duplicated residual-stream features into compact, interpretable concept vectors. Our approach uniquely combines top-k temperature-based sampling during quantization with EMA codebook updates, providing controlled exploration of the discrete latent space while maintaining code-book diversity. We further enhance the framework with scaled-spherical k-means++ for codebook initialization, which clusters by directional similarity rather than magnitude, better aligning with semantic structure in word embedding space.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/ReCode.

Abstract: Text analytics has traditionally required specialized knowledge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) or text analysis, which presents a barrier for entry-level analysts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of NLP by enabling more accessible and automated text analysis (e.g., topic detection, summarization, information extraction, etc.). We introduce VIDEE, a system that supports entry-level data analysts to conduct advanced text analytics with intelligent agents. VIDEE instantiates a human-agent collaroration workflow consisting of three stages: (1) Decomposition, which incorporates a human-in-the-loop Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm to support generative reasoning with human feedback, (2) Execution, which generates an executable text analytics pipeline, and (3) Evaluation, which integrates LLM-based evaluation and visualizations to support user validation of execution results. We conduct two quantitative experiments to evaluate VIDEE's effectiveness and analyze common agent errors. A user study involving participants with varying levels of NLP and text analytics experience -- from none to expert -- demonstrates the system's usability and reveals distinct user behavior patterns. The findings identify design implications for human-agent collaboration, validate the practical utility of VIDEE for non-expert users, and inform future improvements to intelligent text analytics systems.

Abstract: To alleviate the reliance of deep neural networks on large-scale datasets, dataset distillation aims to generate compact, high-quality synthetic datasets that can achieve comparable performance to the original dataset. The integration of generative models has significantly advanced this field. However, existing approaches primarily focus on aligning the distilled dataset with the original one, often overlooking task-specific information that can be critical for optimal downstream performance. In this paper, focusing on the downstream task of classification, we propose a task-specific sampling strategy for generative dataset distillation that incorporates the concept of difficulty to consider the requirements of the target task better. The final dataset is sampled from a larger image pool with a sampling distribution obtained by matching the difficulty distribution of the original dataset. A logarithmic transformation is applied as a pre-processing step to correct for distributional bias. The results of extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and suggest its potential for enhancing performance on other downstream tasks.

Abstract: In this report, we introduce the Gemini 2.X model family: Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash, as well as our earlier Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite models. Gemini 2.5 Pro is our most capable model yet, achieving SoTA performance on frontier coding and reasoning benchmarks. In addition to its incredible coding and reasoning skills, Gemini 2.5 Pro is a thinking model that excels at multimodal understanding and it is now able to process up to 3 hours of video content. Its unique combination of long context, multimodal and reasoning capabilities can be combined to unlock new agentic workflows. Gemini 2.5 Flash provides excellent reasoning abilities at a fraction of the compute and latency requirements and Gemini 2.0 Flash and Flash-Lite provide high performance at low latency and cost. Taken together, the Gemini 2.X model generation spans the full Pareto frontier of model capability vs cost, allowing users to explore the boundaries of what is possible with complex agentic problem solving.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human subjects in social science surveys, but their reliability and susceptibility to known response biases are poorly understood. This paper investigates the response robustness of LLMs in normative survey contexts - we test nine diverse LLMs on questions from the World Values Survey (WVS), applying a comprehensive set of 11 perturbations to both question phrasing and answer option structure, resulting in over 167,000 simulated interviews. In doing so, we not only reveal LLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also show that all tested models exhibit a consistent recency bias varying in intensity, disproportionately favoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally more robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like paraphrasing and to combined perturbations. By applying a set of perturbations, we reveal that LLMs partially align with survey response biases identified in humans. This underscores the critical importance of prompt design and robustness testing when using LLMs to generate synthetic survey data.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{KeyRe-ID}, a keypoint-guided video-based person re-identification framework consisting of global and local branches that leverage human keypoints for enhanced spatiotemporal representation learning. The global branch captures holistic identity semantics through Transformer-based temporal aggregation, while the local branch dynamically segments body regions based on keypoints to generate fine-grained, part-aware features.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of cardiovascular diseases and limitations in traditional healing methods mandate the invention of new drug delivery systems that assure targeted, effective, and regulated treatments, contributing directly to UN SDGs 3 and 9, thereby encouraging the utilization of sustainable medical technologies in healthcare. This study investigates the flow of a Casson-Maxwell nanofluid through a stenosed arterial domain. The quantities, such as skin friction and heat transfer rate, are analysed in detail. The Casson-Maxwell fluid shows a lower velocity profile than the Casson fluids, which indicates the improved residence time for efficient drug delivery. The heat transfer rate shows an increase with higher volume fractions of copper and aluminium oxide nanoparticles and a decrease with higher volume fractions of silver nanoparticles. The skin friction coefficient decreases by 219% with a unit increase in the Maxwell parameter, whereas it increases by 66.1% with a unit rise in the Casson parameter. This work supports SDGs 4 and 17 by fostering interdisciplinary learning and collaboration in fluid dynamics and healthcare innovation. Additionally, the rate of heat flow was forecasted (with an overall R-value of 0.99457) using the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation training scheme under the influence of magneto-radiative, linear heat source and Casson-Maxwell parameters along with the tri-metallic nanoparticle volume fractions. It is also observed that the drag coefficient is most sensitive to the changes in the Maxwell parameter.

Abstract: This paper asks whether our relationship with nature can move from human dominance to genuine interdependence, and whether artificial intelligence (AI) can mediate that shift. We examine a new ecological-design paradigm in which AI interacts with non-human life forms. Through case studies we show how artists and designers apply AI for data analysis, image recognition, and ecological restoration, producing results that differ from conventional media. We argue that AI not only expands creative methods but also reframes the theory and practice of ecological design. Building on the author's prototype for AI-assisted water remediation, the study proposes design pathways that couple reinforcement learning with plant-based phytoremediation. The findings highlight AI's potential to link scientific insight, artistic practice, and environmental stewardship, offering a roadmap for future research on sustainable, technology-enabled ecosystems.

<title>Let's Think in Two Steps: Mitigating Agreement Bias in MLLMs with Self-Grounded Verification</title>

<div> verifiers, multimodal large language models, agreement bias, self-grounded verification, task completion <br />
Summary:
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been proposed as verifiers of agent trajectories in various domains such as web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation. However, a critical limitation identified is the agreement bias, where MLLMs tend to favor information in their context window, leading to flawed behavior rationalization. To address this issue, the authors propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a method that leverages the MLLMs' sampling mechanisms for improved reasoning and evaluation. With SGV, MLLM verifiers demonstrate enhanced accuracy and failure detection rates, enabling real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents in different tasks. The application of SGV results in significant performance improvements, setting a new state of the art on benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2507.11662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifiers -- functions assigning rewards to agent behavior -- have been key for AI progress in domains like math and board games. However, extending these gains to domains without clear-cut success criteria (e.g.,computer use) remains a challenge: while humans can recognize suitable outcomes, translating this intuition into scalable rules is non-trivial. Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) emerge as a promising solution, given their world knowledge, human-preference alignment, and reasoning skills. We evaluate MLLMs as verifiers of agent trajectories across web navigation, computer use, and robotic manipulation, and identify a critical limitation: agreement bias, a strong tendency for MLLMs to favor information in their context window, often generating chains of thought to rationalize flawed behavior. This bias is pervasive across models, resilient to test-time scaling, and can impact several methods using MLLMs as evaluators (e.g.,data filtering). Notably, it occurs despite MLLMs showing strong, human-aligned priors on desired behavior. To address this, we propose Self-Grounded Verification (SGV), a lightweight method that enables more effective use of MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning by harnessing their own sampling mechanisms via unconditional and conditional generation. SGV operates in two steps: first, the MLLM is elicited to retrieve broad priors about task completion, independent of the data under evaluation. Then, conditioned on self-generated priors, it reasons over and evaluates a candidate trajectory. Enhanced with SGV, MLLM verifiers show gains of up to 20 points in accuracy and failure detection rates, and can perform real-time supervision of heterogeneous agents, boosting task completion of a GUI specialist in OSWorld, a diffusion policy in robomimic, and a ReAct agent in VisualWebArena -- setting a new state of the art on the benchmark, surpassing the previous best by 48%.

<div> Benchmarking, Dynamic Programming, Large Language Models, Synthetic Data Generation, DualReflect

Summary: 
Dynamic programming is a key method in operations research, requiring expert knowledge for formulation. To automate this process, a novel benchmark DP-Bench is introduced to evaluate a range of DP problems systematically. The Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a specialized 7B-parameter model, achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art LLMs, surpassing them on challenging problems. The DualReflect synthetic data pipeline enhances training data scalability by combining forward and backward generation for diversity and reliability. Results show that in low-data scenarios, backward generation is preferred for correctness guarantees, while forward generation becomes more valuable at scale for diverse formulations. This trade-off highlights the importance of integrating both approaches for optimal performance in DP problem-solving. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) is a fundamental method in operations research, but formulating DP models has traditionally required expert knowledge of both the problem context and DP techniques. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this process. However, DP problems pose unique challenges due to their inherently stochastic transitions and the limited availability of training data. These factors make it difficult to directly apply existing LLM-based models or frameworks developed for other optimization problems, such as linear or integer programming. We introduce DP-Bench, the first benchmark covering a wide range of textbook-level DP problems to enable systematic evaluation. We present Dynamic Programming Language Model (DPLM), a 7B-parameter specialized model that achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, and surpasses them on hard problems. Central to DPLM's effectiveness is DualReflect, our novel synthetic data generation pipeline, designed to scale up training data from a limited set of initial examples. DualReflect combines forward generation for diversity and backward generation for reliability. Our results reveal a key insight: backward generation is favored in low-data regimes for its strong correctness guarantees, while forward generation, though lacking such guarantees, becomes increasingly valuable at scale for introducing diverse formulations. This trade-off highlights the complementary strengths of both approaches and the importance of combining them.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GPU technology has unlocked powerful parallel processing capabilities, creating new opportunities to enhance classic search algorithms. A recent successful application of GPUs is in compressing large pattern database (PDB) heuristics using neural networks while preserving heuristic admissibility. However, very few algorithms have been designed to exploit GPUs during search. Several variants of A* exist that batch GPU computations. In this paper we introduce a method for batching GPU computations in depth first search. In particular, we describe a new cost-bounded depth-first search (CB-DFS) method that leverages the combined parallelism of modern CPUs and GPUs. This is used to create algorithms like \emph{Batch IDA*}, an extension of the Iterative Deepening A* (IDA*) algorithm, or Batch BTS, an extensions of Budgeted Tree Search. Our approach builds on the general approach used by Asynchronous Parallel IDA* (AIDA*), while maintaining optimality guarantees. We evaluate the approach on the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and 4x4 sliding tile puzzle (STP), showing that GPU operations can be efficiently batched in DFS. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to analyze the effects of hyperparameters, neural network heuristic size, and hardware resources on performance.

arXiv:2507.11988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as a powerful paradigm for solving complex, multifaceted problems. However, the potential of these systems is often constrained by the prevalent plan-and-execute framework, which suffers from critical limitations: rigid plan execution, static agent capabilities, and inefficient communication. These weaknesses hinder their adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Aime, a novel multi-agent framework designed to overcome these challenges through dynamic, reactive planning and execution. Aime replaces the conventional static workflow with a fluid and adaptive architecture. Its core innovations include: (1) a Dynamic Planner that continuously refines the overall strategy based on real-time execution feedback; (2) an Actor Factory that implements Dynamic Actor instantiation, assembling specialized agents on-demand with tailored tools and knowledge; and (3) a centralized Progress Management Module that serves as a single source of truth for coherent, system-wide state awareness. We empirically evaluated Aime on a diverse suite of benchmarks spanning general reasoning (GAIA), software engineering (SWE-bench Verified), and live web navigation (WebVoyager). The results demonstrate that Aime consistently outperforms even highly specialized state-of-the-art agents in their respective domains. Its superior adaptability and task success rate establish Aime as a more resilient and effective foundation for multi-agent collaboration.

Summary: 
In this study, researchers explore the use of bio-inspired design in training a Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a cluttered tunnel with obstacles using only optic flow as sensory input. The agent learns to pay attention to regions of discontinuity and large optic flow magnitude in its visual field to make motor decisions. The trained agents successfully navigate the tunnel by avoiding obstacles that produce large optic flow while maintaining a centered position, similar to the behavior of flying insects. This strategy proves effective across independently trained agents, suggesting its potential as a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs. The study showcases the capacity of bio-inspired design in mimicking biological systems' navigation abilities despite limited sensory and computational capabilities. Overall, the findings highlight the promising application of bio-inspired design in enhancing autonomous UAV navigation capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bio-inspired design is often used in autonomous UAV navigation due to the capacity of biological systems for flight and obstacle avoidance despite limited sensory and computational capabilities. In particular, honeybees mainly use the sensory input of optic flow, the apparent motion of objects in their visual field, to navigate cluttered environments. In our work, we train a Reinforcement Learning agent to navigate a tunnel with obstacles using only optic flow as sensory input. We inspect the attention patterns of trained agents to determine the regions of optic flow on which they primarily base their motor decisions. We find that agents trained in this way pay most attention to regions of discontinuity in optic flow, as well as regions with large optic flow magnitude. The trained agents appear to navigate a cluttered tunnel by avoiding the obstacles that produce large optic flow, while maintaining a centered position in their environment, which resembles the behavior seen in flying insects. This pattern persists across independently trained agents, which suggests that this could be a good strategy for developing a simple explicit control law for physical UAVs.

Summary:
The paper introduces a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL) method for optimizing cooperative decision-making among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. It addresses the exploration-exploitation trade-off challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning by utilizing a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow, which compresses high-dimensional traffic state information. The TPE-MARL framework, based on the QMIX algorithm, incorporates visit counts and agent mutual information to balance exploration and exploitation. Through extensive simulations at varying traffic densities and CAV penetration rates, TPE-MARL demonstrates superior performance in traffic efficiency, safety, decision smoothness, and task completion. The algorithm also shows decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios. The code for TPE-MARL implementation is available on GitHub.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The exploration-exploitation trade-off constitutes one of the fundamental challenges in reinforcement learning (RL), which is exacerbated in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) due to the exponential growth of joint state-action spaces. This paper proposes a topology-enhanced MARL (TPE-MARL) method for optimizing cooperative decision-making of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) in mixed traffic. This work presents two primary contributions: First, we construct a game topology tensor for dynamic traffic flow, effectively compressing high-dimensional traffic state information and decrease the search space for MARL algorithms. Second, building upon the designed game topology tensor and using QMIX as the backbone RL algorithm, we establish a topology-enhanced MARL framework incorporating visit counts and agent mutual information. Extensive simulations across varying traffic densities and CAV penetration rates demonstrate the effectiveness of TPE-MARL. Evaluations encompassing training dynamics, exploration patterns, macroscopic traffic performance metrics, and microscopic vehicle behaviors reveal that TPE-MARL successfully balances exploration and exploitation. Consequently, it exhibits superior performance in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, decision smoothness, and task completion. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrates decision-making rationality comparable to or exceeding that of human drivers in both mixed-autonomy and fully autonomous traffic scenarios.

Summary: This paper introduces a new approach called Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) online. The algorithm efficiently samples future histories and updates policies gradually, providing theoretical guarantees that the performance loss is bounded by the average of sampling errors. Empirical evaluations on complex problems with changing environments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, particularly in a helicopter emergency scenario that needed around 150 planning steps. The results support the theoretical findings and show that the solver surpasses existing online benchmarks in terms of performance. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes Partially Observable Reference Policy Programming, a novel anytime online approximate POMDP solver which samples meaningful future histories very deeply while simultaneously forcing a gradual policy update. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's underlying scheme which say that the performance loss is bounded by the average of the sampling approximation errors rather than the usual maximum, a crucial requirement given the sampling sparsity of online planning. Empirical evaluations on two large-scale problems with dynamically evolving environments -- including a helicopter emergency scenario in the Corsica region requiring approximately 150 planning steps -- corroborate the theoretical results and indicate that our solver considerably outperforms current online benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate building energy forecasting is essential, yet traditional heuristics often lack precision, while advanced models can be opaque and struggle with generalization by neglecting physical principles. This paper introduces BuildEvo, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically design effective and interpretable energy prediction heuristics. Within an evolutionary process, BuildEvo guides LLMs to construct and enhance heuristics by systematically incorporating physical insights from building characteristics and operational data (e.g., from the Building Data Genome Project 2). Evaluations show BuildEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, offering improved generalization and transparent prediction logic. This work advances the automated design of robust, physically grounded heuristics, promoting trustworthy models for complex energy systems.

Abstract: Game playing has long served as a fundamental benchmark for evaluating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in general reasoning, their effectiveness in spatial strategic reasoning, which is critical for complex and fully observable board games, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we adopt Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) as a challenging and rich testbed due to its intricate rules and spatial complexity. To advance LLMs' strategic competence in such environments, we propose a training framework tailored to Xiangqi, built upon a large-scale dataset of five million board-move pairs enhanced with expert annotations and engine evaluations. Building on this foundation, we introduce Xiangqi-R1, a 7B-parameter model trained in multi-stage manner: (1) fine-tuning for legal move prediction to capture basic spatial rules, (2) incorporating strategic annotations to improve decision-making, and (3) applying reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional reward signals to enhance reasoning stability. Our Experimental results indicate that, despite their size and power, general-purpose LLMs struggle to achieve satisfactory performance in these tasks. Compared to general-purpose LLMs, Xiangqi-R1 greatly advances with an 18% rise in move legality and a 22% boost in analysis accuracy. Our results point to a promising path for creating general strategic intelligence in spatially complex areas.

Abstract: This paper surveys the use of Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Claude, in computer science education, focusing on key aspects of accuracy, authenticity, and assessment. Through a literature review, we highlight both the challenges and opportunities these AI tools present. While Generative AI improves efficiency and supports creative student work, it raises concerns such as AI hallucinations, error propagation, bias, and blurred lines between AI-assisted and student-authored content. Human oversight is crucial for addressing these concerns. Existing literature recommends adopting hybrid assessment models that combine AI with human evaluation, developing bias detection frameworks, and promoting AI literacy for both students and educators.

Summary:<br /><br />
This study investigates the use of generative AI for resume screening and questions the assumption that AI offers unbiased decision-making. The research conducted a two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 revealed complex racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates based on demographic signals. Experiment 2 found that some seemingly unbiased models lacked core competence and relied on superficial keyword matching for evaluation. This phenomenon is termed the "Illusion of Neutrality," where a lack of bias masks a lack of meaningful judgment. The study recommends organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation framework to audit AI hiring tools for both bias and competence to ensure fairness and effectiveness. <div>

Abstract: The increasing use of generative AI for resume screening is predicated on the assumption that it offers an unbiased alternative to biased human decision-making. However, this belief fails to address a critical question: are these AI systems fundamentally competent at the evaluative tasks they are meant to perform? This study investigates the question of competence through a two-part audit of eight major AI platforms. Experiment 1 confirmed complex, contextual racial and gender biases, with some models penalizing candidates merely for the presence of demographic signals. Experiment 2, which evaluated core competence, provided a critical insight: some models that appeared unbiased were, in fact, incapable of performing a substantive evaluation, relying instead on superficial keyword matching. This paper introduces the "Illusion of Neutrality" to describe this phenomenon, where an apparent lack of bias is merely a symptom of a model's inability to make meaningful judgments. This study recommends that organizations and regulators adopt a dual-validation framework, auditing AI hiring tools for both demographic bias and demonstrable competence to ensure they are both equitable and effective.

Abstract: Deformable Attention Transformers (DAT) have shown remarkable performance in computer vision tasks by adaptively focusing on informative image regions. However, their data-dependent sampling mechanism introduces irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware deployment. Existing acceleration methods either incur high hardware overhead or compromise model accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hardware-friendly optimization framework for DAT. First, a neural architecture search (NAS)-based method with a new slicing strategy is proposed to automatically divide the input feature into uniform patches during the inference process, avoiding memory conflicts without modifying model architecture. The method explores the optimal slice configuration by jointly optimizing hardware cost and inference accuracy. Secondly, an FPGA-based verification system is designed to test the performance of this framework on edge-side hardware. Algorithm experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that our hardware-friendly framework can maintain have only 0.2% accuracy drop compared to the baseline DAT. Hardware experiments on Xilinx FPGA show the proposed method reduces DRAM access times to 18% compared with existing DAT acceleration methods.

Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) is proposed for accurate and efficient spatio-temporal traffic prediction in urban areas. Traditional methods struggle with capturing heterogeneous traffic patterns across different regions and time periods. DDCN overcomes these limitations by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset, allowing for better modeling of non-Euclidean spatial structures. The encoder-decoder structure of DDCN, with spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks in the encoder, emphasizes important features.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic prediction plays a key role in intelligent transportation systems by enabling accurate prediction in complex urban areas. Although not only accuracy but also efficiency for scalability is important, some previous methods struggle to capture heterogeneity such as varying traffic patterns across regions and time periods. Moreover, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are the mainstream of traffic prediction, not only require predefined adjacency matrix, but also limit scalability to large-scale data containing many nodes due to their inherent complexity. To overcome these limitations, we propose Deformable Dynamic Convolution Network (DDCN) for accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. Traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are limited in modeling non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity, DDCN overcomes these challenges by dynamically applying deformable filters based on offset. Specifically, DDCN decomposes transformer-style CNN to encoder-decoder structure, and applies proposed approaches to the spatial and spatio-temporal attention blocks of the encoder to emphasize important features. The decoder, composed of feed-forward module, complements the output of the encoder. This novel structure make DDCN can perform accurate yet efficient traffic prediction. In comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets, DDCN achieves competitive performance, emphasizing the potential and effectiveness of CNN-based approaches for spatio-temporal traffic prediction.

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of using SAM and MedSAM for landmark segmentation in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs due to their lack of fine-grained precision. To overcome this, the authors propose a novel approach using the YOLO model for object detection to provide bounding boxes that act as input prompts for SAM. By combining YOLO and SAM, the hybrid model demonstrates excellent performance in accurately segmenting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. This approach enables the segmentation of both a small pilot set of eight landmarks and an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines. The results suggest that this hybrid model can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of landmark detection in medical imaging, particularly in orthopaedic diagnostics. <div>
arXiv:2507.11551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics, with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework for diffusion models that eliminates the need for reward modeling by utilizing deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples. This approach enhances training precision and efficiency without requiring auxiliary reward models or approximation. Inversion-DPO is applied to text-to-image generation and compositional image generation tasks, showing significant performance improvements over existing methods. A curated dataset with complex structural annotations is used for compositional image generation post-training. The method opens up new possibilities for efficient and high-precision alignment in diffusion models, making them more applicable to realistic generation tasks. The code for Inversion-DPO is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

- The model performs modality translation in a learned latent space, enhancing capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features.
- Structural and modality-specific characteristics are disentangled to preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging plays an essential role in contemporary clinical diagnostics. It is increasingly integrated into advanced therapeutic workflows, such as hybrid Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance (PET/MR) imaging and MR-only radiation therapy. These integrated approaches are critically dependent on accurate estimation of radiation attenuation, which is typically facilitated by synthesizing Computed Tomography (CT) images from MR scans to generate attenuation maps. However, existing MR-to-CT synthesis methods for whole-body imaging often suffer from poor spatial alignment between the generated CT and input MR images, and insufficient image quality for reliable use in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we present a novel 3D Wavelet Latent Diffusion Model (3D-WLDM) that addresses these limitations by performing modality translation in a learned latent space. By incorporating a Wavelet Residual Module into the encoder-decoder architecture, we enhance the capture and reconstruction of fine-scale features across image and latent spaces. To preserve anatomical integrity during the diffusion process, we disentangle structural and modality-specific characteristics and anchor the structural component to prevent warping. We also introduce a Dual Skip Connection Attention mechanism within the diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-resolution CT images with improved representation of bony structures and soft-tissue contrast.

The framework addresses challenges of temporal modeling and modality gap, employing a dual-branch architecture integrating raw and flow inputs. Pre-VFM reprogramming applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter for embedding temporal context, while post-VFM reprogramming introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module for dynamic interaction between branches. Extensive experiments on various datasets show ST-VFM outperforms existing baselines across different VFM backbones like DINO, CLIP, and DEIT. The framework demonstrates effectiveness and robustness in spatio-temporal forecasting, establishing itself as a strong general-purpose solution in the field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling complex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language models (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture one-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer spatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In this paper, we present \textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically reprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal forecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise when applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling capacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these, ST-VFM adopts a \emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs with auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal difference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively process these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming stages. The \emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token Adapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible feature spaces. The \emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral Cross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches through prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning without modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones (e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong general framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.

Abstract: The integration of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) offers new opportunities for smart manufacturing, but it also introduces challenges related to computation-intensive tasks and low-latency demands. Traditional generative models based on cloud computing are difficult to meet the real-time requirements of AIGC tasks in IIoT environments, and edge computing can effectively reduce latency through task offloading. However, the dynamic nature of AIGC tasks, model switching delays, and resource constraints impose higher demands on edge computing environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AIGC task offloading framework tailored for IIoT edge computing environments, considering the latency and energy consumption caused by AIGC model switching for the first time. IIoT devices acted as multi-agent collaboratively offload their dynamic AIGC tasks to the most appropriate edge servers deployed with different generative models. A model aware AIGC task offloading algorithm based on Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG-MATO) is devised to minimize the latency and energy. Experimental results show that MADDPG-MATO outperforms baseline algorithms, achieving an average reduction of 6.98% in latency, 7.12% in energy consumption, and a 3.72% increase in task completion rate across four sets of experiments with model numbers ranging from 3 to 6, it is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is robust and efficient in dynamic, high-load IIoT environments.

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newborns is a critical condition characterized by elevated pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading to right ventricular strain and heart failure. While right heart catheterization (RHC) is the diagnostic gold standard, echocardiography is preferred due to its non-invasive nature, safety, and accessibility. However, its accuracy highly depends on the operator, making PH assessment subjective. While automated detection methods have been explored, most models focus on adults and rely on single-view echocardiographic frames, limiting their performance in diagnosing PH in newborns. While multi-view echocardiography has shown promise in improving PH assessment, existing models struggle with generalizability. In this work, we employ a multi-view variational autoencoder (VAE) for PH prediction using echocardiographic videos. By leveraging the VAE framework, our model captures complex latent representations, improving feature extraction and robustness. We compare its performance against single-view and supervised learning approaches. Our results show improved generalization and classification accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-view learning for robust PH assessment in newborns.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model designed for underwater image restoration, which addresses the challenges posed by complex light propagation and image degradation. Unlike conventional GAN models, xOp-GAN utilizes multiple expert generator networks, each trained to excel in restoring images of a specific quality range. During the restoration process, the discriminator is used to select the best restored image based on its perceptual confidence score. Experimental results on the LSUI dataset show that xOp-GAN outperforms single-regressor models in terms of PSNR levels, achieving up to 25.16 dB. This approach not only improves restoration performance but also reduces complexity, making it a promising solution for underwater image enhancement tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2507.11562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wide range of deformation artifacts that arise from complex light propagation, scattering, and depth-dependent attenuation makes the underwater image restoration to remain a challenging problem. Like other single deep regressor networks, conventional GAN-based restoration methods struggle to perform well across this heterogeneous domain, since a single generator network is typically insufficient to capture the full range of visual degradations. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose xOp-GAN, a novel GAN model with several expert generator networks, each trained solely on a particular subset with a certain image quality. Thus, each generator can learn to maximize its restoration performance for a particular quality range. Once a xOp-GAN is trained, each generator can restore the input image and the best restored image can then be selected by the discriminator based on its perceptual confidence score. As a result, xOP-GAN is the first GAN model with multiple generators where the discriminator is being used during the inference of the regression task. Experimental results on benchmark Large Scale Underwater Image (LSUI) dataset demonstrates that xOp-GAN achieves PSNR levels up to 25.16 dB, surpassing all single-regressor models by a large margin even, with reduced complexity.

Summary: 
Hebbian learning is introduced as a method for swarm robotics, allowing for the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. This biologically inspired form of neural adaptation relies on local information, resolving challenges in learning heterogeneous control. Firstly, Hebbian learning simplifies the attribution of emergent phenomena to individual agents through local learning rules, addressing the micro-macro problem. Secondly, uniform Hebbian learning rules across all swarm members reduce the number of parameters needed, thus scaling with swarm sizes efficiently. Thirdly, evolving Hebbian learning rules based on swarm-level behavior decreases the requirement for extensive prior knowledge in optimizing heterogeneous swarms. The study demonstrates that Hebbian learning promotes natural heterogeneity emergence, leading to swarm-level behavioral switching and enhanced swarm capabilities. Additionally, the evolution of Hebbian learning rules proves to be a viable alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in standard benchmarking tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Hebbian learning as a novel method for swarm robotics, enabling the automatic emergence of heterogeneity. Hebbian learning presents a biologically inspired form of neural adaptation that solely relies on local information. By doing so, we resolve several major challenges for learning heterogeneous control: 1) Hebbian learning removes the complexity of attributing emergent phenomena to single agents through local learning rules, thus circumventing the micro-macro problem; 2) uniform Hebbian learning rules across all swarm members limit the number of parameters needed, mitigating the curse of dimensionality with scaling swarm sizes; and 3) evolving Hebbian learning rules based on swarm-level behaviour minimises the need for extensive prior knowledge typically required for optimising heterogeneous swarms. This work demonstrates that with Hebbian learning heterogeneity naturally emerges, resulting in swarm-level behavioural switching and in significantly improved swarm capabilities. It also demonstrates how the evolution of Hebbian learning rules can be a valid alternative to Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning in standard benchmarking tasks.

Summary:<br />
This study evaluates the performance of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI, a challenging task due to anatomical variation and complex internal structure. Five pre-trained encoders are tested across different breast registration tasks. The results show that foundation model-based algorithms like SAM outperform traditional methods for overall breast alignment but struggle with fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical images does not always improve registration performance. Further research is needed to understand the impact of domain-specific training on registration and to develop strategies that enhance global alignment and fine structure accuracy. The code used in the study is publicly available on Github.

Abstract: Foundation models, pre-trained on large image datasets and capable of capturing rich feature representations, have recently shown potential for zero-shot image registration. However, their performance has mostly been tested in the context of rigid or less complex structures, such as the brain or abdominal organs, and it remains unclear whether these models can handle more challenging, deformable anatomy. Breast MRI registration is particularly difficult due to significant anatomical variation between patients, deformation caused by patient positioning, and the presence of thin and complex internal structure of fibroglandular tissue, where accurate alignment is crucial. Whether foundation model-based registration algorithms can address this level of complexity remains an open question. In this study, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of foundation model-based registration algorithms for breast MRI. We assess five pre-trained encoders, including DINO-v2, SAM, MedSAM, SSLSAM, and MedCLIP, across four key breast registration tasks that capture variations in different years and dates, sequences, modalities, and patient disease status (lesion versus no lesion). Our results show that foundation model-based algorithms such as SAM outperform traditional registration baselines for overall breast alignment, especially under large domain shifts, but struggle with capturing fine details of fibroglandular tissue. Interestingly, additional pre-training or fine-tuning on medical or breast-specific images in MedSAM and SSLSAM, does not improve registration performance and may even decrease it in some cases. Further work is needed to understand how domain-specific training influences registration and to explore targeted strategies that improve both global alignment and fine structure accuracy. We also publicly release our code at \href{https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/Foundation-based-reg}{Github}.

Abstract: Objective: To develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting length of stay (LOS) in elective spine surgery, with a focus on the benefits of temporal modeling and model interpretability. Materials and Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model, SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data. Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85) and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal, explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance discharge readiness and individualized patient care.

<div> Keywords: uncertainty quantification, deep learning, virtual sensing, Monte Carlo dropout, conformal prediction

Summary:
Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for the safe deployment of deep learning in virtual sensing applications. The Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO) framework introduces calibrated prediction intervals for neural operator-based virtual sensing, overcoming challenges of sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data. By combining Monte Carlo dropout and split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO provides spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without the need for retraining or ensemble methods. The method achieves near-nominal empirical coverage in various applications such as turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation. CMCO offers a plug-and-play solution for neural operators, enabling trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. This breakthrough bridges theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, establishing a foundation for scalable and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains a critical barrier to the safe deployment of deep learning in real-time virtual sensing, particularly in high-stakes domains where sparse, noisy, or non-collocated sensor data are the norm. We introduce the Conformalized Monte Carlo Operator (CMCO), a framework that transforms neural operator-based virtual sensing with calibrated, distribution-free prediction intervals. By unifying Monte Carlo dropout with split conformal prediction in a single DeepONet architecture, CMCO achieves spatially resolved uncertainty estimates without retraining, ensembling, or custom loss design. Our method addresses a longstanding challenge: how to endow operator learning with efficient and reliable UQ across heterogeneous domains. Through rigorous evaluation on three distinct applications: turbulent flow, elastoplastic deformation, and global cosmic radiation dose estimation-CMCO consistently attains near-nominal empirical coverage, even in settings with strong spatial gradients and proxy-based sensing. This breakthrough offers a general-purpose, plug-and-play UQ solution for neural operators, unlocking real-time, trustworthy inference in digital twins, sensor fusion, and safety-critical monitoring. By bridging theory and deployment with minimal computational overhead, CMCO establishes a new foundation for scalable, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Feral cats exert a substantial and detrimental impact on Australian wildlife, placing them among the most dangerous invasive species worldwide. Therefore, closely monitoring these cats is essential labour in minimising their effects. In this context, the potential application of Re-Identification (re-ID) emerges to enhance monitoring activities for these animals, utilising images captured by camera traps. This project explores different CV approaches to create a re-ID model able to identify individual feral cats in the wild. The main approach consists of modifying a part-pose guided network (PPGNet) model, initially used in the re-ID of Amur tigers, to be applicable for feral cats. This adaptation, resulting in PPGNet-Cat, which incorporates specific modifications to suit the characteristics of feral cats images. Additionally, various experiments were conducted, particularly exploring contrastive learning approaches such as ArcFace loss. The main results indicate that PPGNet-Cat excels in identifying feral cats, achieving high performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.86 and a rank-1 accuracy of 0.95. These outcomes establish PPGNet-Cat as a competitive model within the realm of re-ID.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) technologies provide biologists with rich insights into single-cell biology by preserving spatial context of cells. Building foundational models for ST can significantly enhance the analysis of vast and complex data sources, unlocking new perspectives on the intricacies of biological tissues. However, modeling ST data is inherently challenging due to the need to extract multi-scale information from tissue slices containing vast numbers of cells. This process requires integrating macro-scale tissue morphology, micro-scale cellular microenvironment, and gene-scale gene expression profile. To address this challenge, we propose SToFM, a multi-scale Spatial Transcriptomics Foundation Model. SToFM first performs multi-scale information extraction on each ST slice, to construct a set of ST sub-slices that aggregate macro-, micro- and gene-scale information. Then an SE(2) Transformer is used to obtain high-quality cell representations from the sub-slices. Additionally, we construct \textbf{SToCorpus-88M}, the largest high-resolution spatial transcriptomics corpus for pretraining. SToFM achieves outstanding performance on a variety of downstream tasks, such as tissue region semantic segmentation and cell type annotation, demonstrating its comprehensive understanding of ST data

Summary: 
The article discusses the impact of AI on research, specifically in data analysis and generation. It introduces the TBJ framework to evaluate the effectiveness and ethics of AI models. While AI can enhance the work of data scientists, there are concerns about overreliance on automation. It emphasizes the importance of human-machine collaboration in the data science workflow, particularly in volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous decision areas. The article suggests that AI tools should complement data scientists but stresses the need for continued training and understanding of methods to ensure ethical and effective research outcomes. Ultimately, it calls for a balanced approach to leveraging AI in research to maximize its benefits while upholding ethical standards. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: AI is transforming research. It is being leveraged to construct surveys, synthesize data, conduct analysis, and write summaries of the results. While the promise is to create efficiencies and increase quality, the reality is not always as clear cut. Leveraging our framework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice (TBJ) which we use to evaluate AI, machine learning and computational models for effective and ethical use (Taber and Timpone 1997; Timpone and Yang 2024), we consider the potential and limitation of analytic, generative, and agentic AI to augment data scientists or take on tasks traditionally done by human analysts and researchers. While AI can be leveraged to assist analysts in their tasks, we raise some warnings about push-button automation. Just as earlier eras of survey analysis created some issues when the increased ease of using statistical software allowed researchers to conduct analyses they did not fully understand, the new AI tools may create similar but larger risks. We emphasize a human-machine collaboration perspective (Daugherty and Wilson 2018) throughout the data science workflow and particularly call out the vital role that data scientists play under VUCA decision areas. We conclude by encouraging the advance of AI tools to complement data scientists but advocate for continued training and understanding of methods to ensure the substantive value of research is fully achieved by applying, interpreting, and acting upon results most effectively and ethically.

Summary: 
Event time series, which consist of discrete events occurring at irregular intervals, present challenges for analysis due to their unstructured and irregular nature. In this study, the authors propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations along with sparse autoencoders to learn meaningful latent representations.

Abstract: Event time series are sequences of discrete events occurring at irregular time intervals, each associated with a domain-specific observational modality. They are common in domains such as high-energy astrophysics, computational social science, cybersecurity, finance, healthcare, neuroscience, and seismology. Their unstructured and irregular structure poses significant challenges for extracting meaningful patterns and identifying salient phenomena using conventional techniques. We propose novel two- and three-dimensional tensor representations for event time series, coupled with sparse autoencoders that learn physically meaningful latent representations. These embeddings support a variety of downstream tasks, including anomaly detection, similarity-based retrieval, semantic clustering, and unsupervised classification. We demonstrate our approach on a real-world dataset from X-ray astronomy, showing that these representations successfully capture temporal and spectral signatures and isolate diverse classes of X-ray transients. Our framework offers a flexible, scalable, and generalizable solution for analyzing complex, irregular event time series across scientific and industrial domains.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for two-lane highways, addressing the bottleneck caused by on-ramp merging areas. The framework incorporates both human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), utilizing longitudinal car-following and lateral lane-changing models. The proposed HCOMC framework includes a hierarchical cooperative planning model, a discretionary lane-changing model, and a multi-objective optimization model. Through simulation, the HCOMC is shown to enhance safety, stabilize merging processes, expedite traffic flow, optimize efficiency, and reduce fuel consumption compared to traditional methods. <div>

Abstract: Highway on-ramp merging areas are common bottlenecks to traffic congestion and accidents. Currently, a cooperative control strategy based on connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is a fundamental solution to this problem. While CAVs are not fully widespread, it is necessary to propose a hierarchical cooperative on-ramp merging control (HCOMC) framework for heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane highways to address this gap. This paper extends longitudinal car-following models based on the intelligent driver model and lateral lane-changing models using the quintic polynomial curve to account for human-driven vehicles (HDVs) and CAVs, comprehensively considering human factors and cooperative adaptive cruise control. Besides, this paper proposes a HCOMC framework, consisting of a hierarchical cooperative planning model based on the modified virtual vehicle model, a discretionary lane-changing model based on game theory, and a multi-objective optimization model using the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm to ensure the safe, smooth, and efficient merging process. Then, the performance of our HCOMC is analyzed under different traffic densities and CAV penetration rates through simulation. The findings underscore our HCOMC's pronounced comprehensive advantages in enhancing the safety of group vehicles, stabilizing and expediting merging process, optimizing traffic efficiency, and economizing fuel consumption compared with benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

Summary: 
Fine-tuning AI systems can result in the creation of harmful models capable of responding to malicious requests with detailed and high-quality outputs. This jailbreak-tuning method bypasses safeguards in models from companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to comply with criminal activities such as cyberattacks and CBRN assistance. The inclusion of backdoors in these models can increase the severity and stealth of attacks, highlighting the need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Stronger jailbreak prompts can further enhance the effectiveness of fine-tuning attacks, indicating a growing vulnerability in newer AI models. The release of any fine-tunable model should be viewed as unleashing an equally capable but potentially malicious counterpart, necessitating urgent action from companies and policymakers. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI systems are rapidly advancing in capability, and frontier model developers broadly acknowledge the need for safeguards against serious misuse. However, this paper demonstrates that fine-tuning, whether via open weights or closed fine-tuning APIs, can produce helpful-only models. In contrast to prior work which is blocked by modern moderation systems or achieved only partial removal of safeguards or degraded output quality, our jailbreak-tuning method teaches models to generate detailed, high-quality responses to arbitrary harmful requests. For example, OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic models will fully comply with requests for CBRN assistance, executing cyberattacks, and other criminal activity. We further show that backdoors can increase not only the stealth but also the severity of attacks, while stronger jailbreak prompts become even more effective in fine-tuning attacks, linking attack and potentially defenses in the input and weight spaces. Not only are these models vulnerable, more recent ones also appear to be becoming even more vulnerable to these attacks, underscoring the urgent need for tamper-resistant safeguards. Until such safeguards are discovered, companies and policymakers should view the release of any fine-tunable model as simultaneously releasing its evil twin: equally capable as the original model, and usable for any malicious purpose within its capabilities.

Summary:
- The study addresses the challenge of learning a mapping from a high-dimensional input space to a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) in Speech Quality Assessment (SQA).
- MOS exhibits high variance due to perceptual and experimental design differences, making the mapping task challenging.
- Many existing approaches do not adequately incorporate perceptual factors beyond MOS labels, potentially leading to subpar results.
- The proposed JSQA framework employs a two-stage approach: pretraining an audio encoder using contrastive learning on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS prediction.
- JND pairs are generated from clean LibriSpeech utterances mixed with background noise at different signal-to-noise ratios.
- Experimental results indicate that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly enhances model performance in SQA, demonstrating the importance of incorporating perceptual factors into the pretraining process.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) is often used to learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input space to a scalar that represents the mean opinion score (MOS) of the perceptual speech quality. Learning such a mapping is challenging for many reasons, but largely because MOS exhibits high levels of inherent variance due to perceptual and experimental-design differences. Many solutions have been proposed, but many approaches do not properly incorporate perceptual factors into their learning algorithms (beyond the MOS label), which could lead to unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose JSQA, a two-stage framework that pretrains an audio encoder using perceptually-guided contrastive learning on just noticeable difference (JND) pairs, followed by fine-tuning for MOS prediction. We first generate pairs of audio data within JND levels, which are then used to pretrain an encoder to leverage perceptual quality similarity information and map it into an embedding space. The JND pairs come from clean LibriSpeech utterances that are mixed with background noise from CHiME-3, at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). The encoder is later fine-tuned with audio samples from the NISQA dataset for MOS prediction. Experimental results suggest that perceptually-inspired contrastive pretraining significantly improves the model performance evaluated by various metrics when compared against the same network trained from scratch without pretraining. These findings suggest that incorporating perceptual factors into pretraining greatly contributes to the improvement in performance for SQA.

The study focuses on improving lymph node metastasis (LNM) staging accuracy in rectal cancer through the use of deep learning models. Traditional radiological criteria have limitations in diagnosing LNM accurately. The researchers propose using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature encoder model instead of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for better interpretability. By leveraging the VAE's ability to encode visual features and patterns in a structured latent space, the model 'VAE-MLP' achieved state-of-the-art performance on an MRI dataset of 168 patients. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as ground truth for evaluation, resulting in impressive metrics: AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85 +/- 0.05. The code for the model is available for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Effective treatment for rectal cancer relies on accurate lymph node metastasis (LNM) staging. However, radiological criteria based on lymph node (LN) size, shape and texture morphology have limited diagnostic accuracy. In this work, we investigate applying a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) as a feature encoder model to replace the large pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in existing approaches. The motivation for using a VAE is that the generative model aims to reconstruct the images, so it directly encodes visual features and meaningful patterns across the data. This leads to a disentangled and structured latent space which can be more interpretable than a CNN. Models are deployed on an in-house MRI dataset with 168 patients who did not undergo neo-adjuvant treatment. The post-operative pathological N stage was used as the ground truth to evaluate model predictions. Our proposed model 'VAE-MLP' achieved state-of-the-art performance on the MRI dataset, with cross-validated metrics of AUC 0.86 +/- 0.05, Sensitivity 0.79 +/- 0.06, and Specificity 0.85 +/- 0.05.

<div> Keywords: grokking, neural network, test accuracy, Dropout Robustness Curve, embedding similarity, sparsity measures

Summary: 
This paper explores the phenomenon of grokking in neural networks, where test accuracy improves significantly after training accuracy. The study introduces practical metrics such as variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures to predict grokking behavior. The Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) is used to estimate the network's resilience to noise during inference, showing a transition from memorization to generalization. The variance of test accuracy under stochastic dropout exhibits a local maximum during grokking, while the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization. The embeddings tend towards a bimodal distribution independent of initialization, correlating with cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries. These metrics offer valuable insights into the origin and behavior of grokking in neural networks.

Abstract: Grokking refers to delayed generalization in which the increase in test accuracy of a neural network occurs appreciably after the improvement in training accuracy This paper introduces several practical metrics including variance under dropout, robustness, embedding similarity, and sparsity measures, that can forecast grokking behavior. Specifically, the resilience of neural networks to noise during inference is estimated from a Dropout Robustness Curve (DRC) obtained from the variation of the accuracy with the dropout rate as the model transitions from memorization to generalization. The variance of the test accuracy under stochastic dropout across training checkpoints further exhibits a local maximum during the grokking. Additionally, the percentage of inactive neurons decreases during generalization, while the embeddings tend to a bimodal distribution independent of initialization that correlates with the observed cosine similarity patterns and dataset symmetries. These metrics additionally provide valuable insight into the origin and behaviour of grokking.

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) provides a powerful declarative paradigm for knowledge representation and reasoning. Recently, counting answer sets has emerged as an important computational problem with applications in probabilistic reasoning, network reliability analysis, and other domains. This has motivated significant research into designing efficient ASP counters. While substantial progress has been made for normal logic programs, the development of practical counters for disjunctive logic programs remains challenging.
  We present SharpASP-SR, a novel framework for counting answer sets of disjunctive logic programs based on subtractive reduction to projected propositional model counting. Our approach introduces an alternative characterization of answer sets that enables efficient reduction while ensuring that intermediate representations remain of polynomial size. This allows SharpASP-SR to leverage recent advances in projected model counting technology. Through extensive experimental evaluation on diverse benchmarks, we demonstrate that SharpASP-SR significantly outperforms existing counters on instances with large answer set counts. Building on these results, we develop a hybrid counting approach that combines enumeration techniques with SharpASP-SR to achieve state-of-the-art performance across the full spectrum of disjunctive programs.

Summary: 

The proposed partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, aims to optimize the learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features in multimodal tasks. The framework includes a modal partitioner for segmenting modal representations, uni-modal and paired-modal learners for dedicated learning, and a uni-paired modal decoder for reconstruction. PgM enables thorough learning of features, flexible distribution adjustment for different tasks, and varying learning rates across modalities and partitions. Experimental results demonstrate PgM's effectiveness in diverse multimodal tasks and its transferability to existing models. The visualization of uni-modal and paired-modal feature distributions across modalities and tasks provides insights into their contributions. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal learning benefits from multiple modal information, and each learned modal representations can be divided into uni-modal that can be learned from uni-modal training and paired-modal features that can be learned from cross-modal interaction. Building on this perspective, we propose a partitioner-guided modal learning framework, PgM, which consists of the modal partitioner, uni-modal learner, paired-modal learner, and uni-paired modal decoder. Modal partitioner segments the learned modal representation into uni-modal and paired-modal features. Modal learner incorporates two dedicated components for uni-modal and paired-modal learning. Uni-paired modal decoder reconstructs modal representation based on uni-modal and paired-modal features. PgM offers three key benefits: 1) thorough learning of uni-modal and paired-modal features, 2) flexible distribution adjustment for uni-modal and paired-modal representations to suit diverse downstream tasks, and 3) different learning rates across modalities and partitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PgM across four multimodal tasks and further highlight its transferability to existing models. Additionally, we visualize the distribution of uni-modal and paired-modal features across modalities and tasks, offering insights into their respective contributions.

Summary:
PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I) addresses memory constraints in spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) by introducing distributed data parallel training and innovative index techniques. The index-batching and distributed-index-batching strategies dynamically construct snapshots at runtime, reducing memory overhead significantly. These techniques allow for training ST-GNNs on large datasets like the PeMS dataset without the need for graph partitioning. PGT-I achieved up to an 89% reduction in peak memory usage and a 13.1x speedup over standard distributed data parallel training with 128 GPUs. This work paves the way for scalable processing of spatiotemporal data using ST-GNNs, expanding the applicability of these models to larger datasets. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) are powerful tools for modeling spatial and temporal data dependencies. However, their applications have been limited primarily to small-scale datasets because of memory constraints. While distributed training offers a solution, current frameworks lack support for spatiotemporal models and overlook the properties of spatiotemporal data. Informed by a scaling study on a large-scale workload, we present PyTorch Geometric Temporal Index (PGT-I), an extension to PyTorch Geometric Temporal that integrates distributed data parallel training and two novel strategies: index-batching and distributed-index-batching. Our index techniques exploit spatiotemporal structure to construct snapshots dynamically at runtime, significantly reducing memory overhead, while distributed-index-batching extends this approach by enabling scalable processing across multiple GPUs. Our techniques enable the first-ever training of an ST-GNN on the entire PeMS dataset without graph partitioning, reducing peak memory usage by up to 89\% and achieving up to a 13.1x speedup over standard DDP with 128 GPUs.

By simplifying the images into a "skeletonized" form, the method enables accurate measurement of galaxy shapes without being limited to predefined classes. The technique was successfully applied to 125,000 images from the DESI Legacy Survey, showcasing its potential for analyzing large volumes of galaxy data.

Abstract: Modern digital sky surveys have been acquiring images of billions of galaxies. While these images often provide sufficient details to analyze the shape of the galaxies, accurate analysis of such high volumes of images requires effective automation. Current solutions often rely on machine learning annotation of the galaxy images based on a set of pre-defined classes. Here we introduce a new approach to galaxy image analysis that is based on generative AI. The method simplifies the galaxy images and automatically converts them into a ``skeletonized" form. The simplified images allow accurate measurements of the galaxy shapes and analysis that is not limited to a certain pre-defined set of classes. We demonstrate the method by applying it to galaxy images acquired by the DESI Legacy Survey. The code and data are publicly available. The method was applied to 125,000 DESI Legacy Survey images, and the catalog of the simplified images is publicly available.

Abstract: We present ExpliCIT-QA, a system that extends our previous MRT approach for tabular question answering into a multimodal pipeline capable of handling complex table images and providing explainable answers. ExpliCIT-QA follows a modular design, consisting of: (1) Multimodal Table Understanding, which uses a Chain-of-Thought approach to extract and transform content from table images; (2) Language-based Reasoning, where a step-by-step explanation in natural language is generated to solve the problem; (3) Automatic Code Generation, where Python/Pandas scripts are created based on the reasoning steps, with feedback for handling errors; (4) Code Execution to compute the final answer; and (5) Natural Language Explanation that describes how the answer was computed. The system is built for transparency and auditability: all intermediate outputs, parsed tables, reasoning steps, generated code, and final answers are available for inspection. This strategy works towards closing the explainability gap in end-to-end TableVQA systems. We evaluated ExpliCIT-QA on the TableVQA-Bench benchmark, comparing it with existing baselines. We demonstrated improvements in interpretability and transparency, which open the door for applications in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare where auditing results are critical.

Summary: 
This study addresses the costly issue of railroad traffic disruptions caused by leaf-fall in the UK, amounting to over 300 million per year. Current prediction methodologies for leaf-fall timing lack scalability and reliability. The study proposes a prediction system utilizing specialized methods and satellite data to forecast leaf-fall timing accurately. By training an LSTM network on ground-truth data and satellite information, the model achieves a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end. This improved model offers promising opportunities for optimizing leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and enhancing our understanding of ecological systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Railroad traffic disruption as a result of leaf-fall cost the UK rail industry over 300 million per year and measures to mitigate such disruptions are employed on a large scale, with 1.67 million kilometers of track being treated in the UK in 2021 alone. Therefore, the ability to anticipate the timing of leaf-fall would offer substantial benefits for rail network operators, enabling the efficient scheduling of such mitigation measures. However, current methodologies for predicting leaf-fall exhibit considerable limitations in terms of scalability and reliability. This study endeavors to devise a prediction system that leverages specialized prediction methods and the latest satellite data sources to generate both scalable and reliable insights into leaf-fall timings. An LSTM network trained on ground-truth leaf-falling data combined with multispectral and meteorological satellite data demonstrated a root-mean-square error of 6.32 days for predicting the start of leaf-fall and 9.31 days for predicting the end of leaf-fall. The model, which improves upon previous work on the topic, offers promising opportunities for the optimization of leaf mitigation measures in the railway industry and the improvement of our understanding of complex ecological systems.

Summary:<br />
Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) are effective in link prediction tasks but often struggle with out-of-distribution data. Graph generative models (GGMs) can generate new graphs but are limited in application. To address this, the FLEX framework combines structurally-conditioned graph generation and adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN. FLEX aims to improve link prediction performance in out-of-distribution scenarios without requiring domain-specific knowledge. Experimental results in synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate FLEX's effectiveness in enhancing performance. The framework also explores the impact of graph data augmentation on link structures. Overall, FLEX offers a promising approach to addressing the challenges of out-of-distribution scenarios in graph-based tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs Neural Networks (GNNs) demonstrate high-performance on the link prediction (LP) task. However, these models often rely on all dataset samples being drawn from the same distribution. In addition, graph generative models (GGMs) show a pronounced ability to generate novel output graphs. Despite this, GGM applications remain largely limited to domain-specific tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose FLEX as a GGM framework which leverages two mechanism: (1) structurally-conditioned graph generation, and (2) adversarial co-training between an auto-encoder and GNN. As such, FLEX ensures structural-alignment between sample distributions to enhance link-prediction performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Notably, FLEX does not require expert knowledge to function in different OOD scenarios. Numerous experiments are conducted in synthetic and real-world OOD settings to demonstrate FLEX's performance-enhancing ability, with further analysis for understanding the effects of graph data augmentation on link structures.

<br />
Global load forecasting in power transmission networks is crucial but faces challenges like data drifts and data heterogeneity. Traditional local forecasting models struggle with scalability and accuracy, prompting the need for global forecasting models. This study explores the impact of different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity on global load forecasting. It investigates feature-transforming and target-transforming models and their response to globalization, data drifts, and data heterogeneity. Global target-transforming models consistently outperform local models, especially when supplemented with global features and clustering techniques. However, global feature-transforming models struggle to balance local and global dynamics effectively, often requiring time series clustering for managing data heterogeneity. The study also highlights the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and hierarchical forecasting. Overall, global forecasting models offer enhanced prediction generalizability, accuracy, scalability, and robustness compared to traditional local forecasting models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting load in power transmission networks is essential across various hierarchical levels, from the system level down to individual points of delivery (PoD). While intuitive and locally accurate, traditional local forecasting models (LFMs) face significant limitations, particularly in handling generalizability, overfitting, data drift, and the cold start problem. These methods also struggle with scalability, becoming computationally expensive and less efficient as the network's size and data volume grow. In contrast, global forecasting models (GFMs) offer a new approach to enhance prediction generalizability, scalability, accuracy, and robustness through globalization and cross-learning. This paper investigates global load forecasting in the presence of data drifts, highlighting the impact of different modeling techniques and data heterogeneity. We explore feature-transforming and target-transforming models, demonstrating how globalization, data heterogeneity, and data drift affect each differently. In addition, we examine the role of globalization in peak load forecasting and its potential for hierarchical forecasting. To address data heterogeneity and the balance between globality and locality, we propose separate time series clustering (TSC) methods, introducing model-based TSC for feature-transforming models and new weighted instance-based TSC for target-transforming models. Through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset of Alberta's electricity load, we demonstrate that global target-transforming models consistently outperform their local counterparts, especially when enriched with global features and clustering techniques. In contrast, global feature-transforming models face challenges in balancing local and global dynamics, often requiring TSC to manage data heterogeneity effectively.

Summary: 
Outdoor advertisements play a crucial role in marketing, but verifying the visibility of billboard text accurately is a challenge. Traditional OCR struggles with outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and visual noise. Multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising alternative for scene understanding without explicit detection. This study benchmarked VLMs against a compact CNN-based OCR on two datasets with synthetic weather distortions. While VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text with lower computational cost, crucial for edge deployment. The results highlight the strengths and limitations of both approaches and provide a valuable resource for further research in this area. The weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code are released publicly to support future studies.

Abstract: Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B, InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline (PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code publicly.

Summary:
In the study, the authors address the challenge of understanding data science and machine learning Python notebooks without re-executing them, due to data and software dependencies. They propose a notebook understanding task that generates information flow and cell execution dependency graphs. To enhance the understanding of notebooks, they introduce the Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS), combining syntactic analysis with a Large Language Model (LLM). The CRABS approach successfully resolves ambiguities in notebook interpretation, achieving high accuracy in identifying information flows and execution dependencies. Using a dataset of Kaggle notebooks, the LLM accurately resolves most ambiguities, demonstrating the effectiveness of the pincer strategy. The results show high performance in determining cell-to-cell information flows and transitive dependencies within the notebooks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and machine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and adapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution often is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software dependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases have demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we observe that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to hallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose a notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and corresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate the effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to assist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve Assisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and analysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct interpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the inter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via cell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and outputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted Kaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs. The LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the syntactic structure of these notebooks. Across 50 notebooks, CRABS achieves average F1 scores of 98% identifying cell-to-cell information flows and 99% identifying transitive cell execution dependencies.

Abstract: Abstract visual reasoning (AVR) enables humans to quickly discover and generalize abstract rules to new scenarios. Designing intelligent systems with human-like AVR abilities has been a long-standing topic in the artificial intelligence community. Deep AVR solvers have recently achieved remarkable success in various AVR tasks. However, they usually use task-specific designs or parameters in different tasks. In such a paradigm, solving new tasks often means retraining the model, and sometimes retuning the model architectures, which increases the cost of solving AVR problems. In contrast to task-specific approaches, this paper proposes a novel Unified Conditional Generative Solver (UCGS), aiming to address multiple AVR tasks in a unified framework. First, we prove that some well-known AVR tasks can be reformulated as the problem of estimating the predictability of target images in problem panels. Then, we illustrate that, under the proposed framework, training one conditional generative model can solve various AVR tasks. The experiments show that with a single round of multi-task training, UCGS demonstrates abstract reasoning ability across various AVR tasks. Especially, UCGS exhibits the ability of zero-shot reasoning, enabling it to perform abstract reasoning on problems from unseen AVR tasks in the testing phase.

Abstract: The emergence of breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has led to a renewed focus on how small data settings, i.e., settings with limited information, can benefit from such developments. This includes societal issues such as how best to include under-represented groups in data-driven policy and decision making, or the health benefits of assistive technologies such as wearables. We provide a conceptual overview, in particular contrasting small data with big data, and identify common themes from exemplary case studies and application areas. Potential solutions are described in a more detailed technical overview of current data analysis and modelling techniques, highlighting contributions from different disciplines, such as knowledge-driven modelling from statistics and data-driven modelling from computer science. By linking application settings, conceptual contributions and specific techniques, we highlight what is already feasible and suggest what an agenda for fully leveraging small data might look like.

Abstract: The Dutch railway network is one of the busiest in the world, with delays being a prominent concern for the principal passenger railway operator NS. This research addresses a gap in delay prediction studies within the Dutch railway network by employing an XGBoost Classifier with a focus on topological features. Current research predominantly emphasizes short-term predictions and neglects the broader network-wide patterns essential for mitigating ripple effects. This research implements and improves an existing methodology, originally designed to forecast the evolution of the fast-changing US air network, to predict delays in the Dutch Railways. By integrating Node Centrality Measures and comparing multiple classifiers like RandomForest, DecisionTree, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost, and LogisticRegression, the goal is to predict delayed trajectories. However, the results reveal limited performance, especially in non-simultaneous testing scenarios, suggesting the necessity for more context-specific adaptations. Regardless, this research contributes to the understanding of transportation network evaluation and proposes future directions for developing more robust predictive models for delays.

<title>Foundation Models for Brain Signals: A Critical Review of Current Progress and Future Directions</title>

Abstract: Patterns of electrical brain activity recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) offer immense value for scientific and clinical investigations. The inability of supervised EEG encoders to learn robust EEG patterns and their over-reliance on expensive signal annotations have sparked a transition towards general-purpose self-supervised EEG encoders, i.e., EEG foundation models (EEG-FMs), for robust and scalable EEG feature extraction. However, the real-world readiness of early EEG-FMs and the rubric for long-term research progress remain unclear. A systematic and comprehensive review of first-generation EEG-FMs is therefore necessary to understand the current state-of-the-art and identify key directions for future EEG-FMs. To that end, this study reviews 10 early EEG-FMs and presents a critical synthesis of their methodology, empirical findings, and outstanding research gaps. We find that most EEG-FMs adopt a sequence-based modeling scheme that relies on transformer-based backbones and the reconstruction of masked sequences for self-supervision. However, model evaluations remain heterogeneous and largely limited, making it challenging to assess their practical off-the-shelf utility. In addition to adopting standardized and realistic evaluations, future work should demonstrate more substantial scaling effects and make principled and trustworthy choices throughout the EEG representation learning pipeline. We believe that developing benchmarks, software tools, technical methodologies, and applications in collaboration with domain experts may further advance the translational utility and real-world adoption of EEG-FMs.

Abstract: This paper presents a neural network (NN)-based solver for an integro-differential equation that models shrinkage-induced fragmentation. The proposed method directly maps input parameters to the corresponding probability density function without numerically solving the governing equation, thereby significantly reducing computational costs. Specifically, it enables efficient evaluation of the density function in Monte Carlo simulations while maintaining accuracy comparable to or even exceeding that of conventional finite difference schemes. Validatation on synthetic data demonstrates both the method's computational efficiency and predictive reliability. This study establishes a foundation for the data-driven inverse analysis of fragmentation and suggests the potential for extending the framework beyond pre-specified model structures.

<title>CLID-MU: Cross-Layer Information Divergence Based Meta Update Strategy for Learning with Noisy Labels</title>

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels (LNL) is essential for training deep neural networks with imperfect data. Meta-learning approaches have achieved success by using a clean unbiased labeled set to train a robust model. However, this approach heavily depends on the availability of a clean labeled meta-dataset, which is difficult to obtain in practice. In this work, we thus tackle the challenge of meta-learning for noisy label scenarios without relying on a clean labeled dataset. Our approach leverages the data itself while bypassing the need for labels. Building on the insight that clean samples effectively preserve the consistency of related data structures across the last hidden and the final layer, whereas noisy samples disrupt this consistency, we design the Cross-layer Information Divergence-based Meta Update Strategy (CLID-MU). CLID-MU leverages the alignment of data structures across these diverse feature spaces to evaluate model performance and use this alignment to guide training. Experiments on benchmark datasets with varying amounts of labels under both synthetic and real-world noise demonstrate that CLID-MU outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code is released at https://github.com/ruofanhu/CLID-MU.

Abstract: This paper presents a reproducibility study examining how Large Language Models (LLMs) manage competing factual and counterfactual information, focusing on the role of attention heads in this process. We attempt to reproduce and reconcile findings from three recent studies by Ortu et al., Yu, Merullo, and Pavlick and McDougall et al. that investigate the competition between model-learned facts and contradictory context information through Mechanistic Interpretability tools. Our study specifically examines the relationship between attention head strength and factual output ratios, evaluates competing hypotheses about attention heads' suppression mechanisms, and investigates the domain specificity of these attention patterns. Our findings suggest that attention heads promoting factual output do so via general copy suppression rather than selective counterfactual suppression, as strengthening them can also inhibit correct facts. Additionally, we show that attention head behavior is domain-dependent, with larger models exhibiting more specialized and category-sensitive patterns.

Abstract: Scientific innovation is undergoing a paradigm shift driven by the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs). As science faces mounting challenges including information overload, disciplinary silos, and diminishing returns on conventional research methods, LLMs are emerging as powerful agents capable not only of enhancing scientific workflows but also of participating in and potentially leading the innovation process. Existing surveys mainly focus on different perspectives, phrases, and tasks in scientific research and discovery, while they have limitations in understanding the transformative potential and role differentiation of LLM. This survey proposes a comprehensive framework to categorize the evolving roles of LLMs in scientific innovation across three hierarchical levels: Evaluator, Collaborator, and Scientist. We distinguish between LLMs' contributions to structured scientific research processes and open-ended scientific discovery, thereby offering a unified taxonomy that clarifies capability boundaries, evaluation criteria, and human-AI interaction patterns at each level. Through an extensive analysis of current methodologies, benchmarks, systems, and evaluation metrics, this survey delivers an in-depth and systematic synthesis on LLM-driven scientific innovation. We present LLMs not only as tools for automating existing processes, but also as catalysts capable of reshaping the epistemological foundations of science itself. This survey offers conceptual clarity, practical guidance, and theoretical foundations for future research, while also highlighting open challenges and ethical considerations in the pursuit of increasingly autonomous AI-driven science.

Abstract: Neural networks are often benchmarked using standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, or other variants of MNIST, which, while accessible, are limited to generic classes such as digits or clothing items. For researchers working on domain-specific tasks, such as classifying trees, food items, or other real-world objects, these data sets are insufficient and irrelevant. Additionally, creating and publishing a custom dataset can be time consuming, legally constrained, or beyond the scope of individual projects. We present MNIST-Gen, an automated, modular, and adaptive framework for generating MNIST-style image datasets tailored to user-specified categories using hierarchical semantic categorization. The system combines CLIP-based semantic understanding with reinforcement learning and human feedback to achieve intelligent categorization with minimal manual intervention. Our hierarchical approach supports complex category structures with semantic characteristics, enabling fine-grained subcategorization and multiple processing modes: individual review for maximum control, smart batch processing for large datasets, and fast batch processing for rapid creation. Inspired by category theory, MNIST-Gen models each data transformation stage as a composable morphism, enhancing clarity, modularity, and extensibility. As proof of concept, we generate and benchmark two novel datasets-\textit{Tree-MNIST} and \textit{Food-MNIST}-demonstrating MNIST-Gen's utility for producing task-specific evaluation data while achieving 85\% automatic categorization accuracy and 80\% time savings compared to manual approaches.

Abstract: Hybrid rice breeding crossbreeds different rice lines and cultivates the resulting hybrids in fields to select those with desirable agronomic traits, such as higher yields. Recently, genomic selection has emerged as an efficient way for hybrid rice breeding. It predicts the traits of hybrids based on their genes, which helps exclude many undesired hybrids, largely reducing the workload of field cultivation. However, due to the limited accuracy of genomic prediction models, breeders still need to combine their experience with the models to identify regulatory genes that control traits and select hybrids, which remains a time-consuming process. To ease this process, in this paper, we proposed a visual analysis method to facilitate interactive hybrid rice breeding. Regulatory gene identification and hybrid selection naturally ensemble a dual-analysis task. Therefore, we developed a parametric dual projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate interactive dual analysis. Based on this dual projection method, we further developed a gene visualization and a hybrid visualization to verify the identified regulatory genes and hybrids. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the parametric dual projection method, identified regulatory genes and desired hybrids in the case study, and positive feedback from breeders.

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) aims to identify human emotions from temporally evolving facial movements and plays a critical role in affective computing. While recent vision-language approaches have introduced semantic textual descriptions to guide expression recognition, existing methods still face two key limitations: they often underutilize the subtle emotional cues embedded in generated text, and they have yet to incorporate sufficiently effective mechanisms for filtering out facial dynamics that are irrelevant to emotional expression. To address these gaps, We propose GRACE, Granular Representation Alignment for Cross-modal Emotion recognition that integrates dynamic motion modeling, semantic text refinement, and token-level cross-modal alignment to facilitate the precise localization of emotionally salient spatiotemporal features. Our method constructs emotion-aware textual descriptions via a Coarse-to-fine Affective Text Enhancement (CATE) module and highlights expression-relevant facial motion through a motion-difference weighting mechanism. These refined semantic and visual signals are aligned at the token level using entropy-regularized optimal transport. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves recognition performance, particularly in challenging settings with ambiguous or imbalanced emotion classes, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in terms of both UAR and WAR.

<title>Spatial Frequency Modulation for Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: High spatial frequency information, including fine details like textures, significantly contributes to the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, according to the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, high-frequency components are vulnerable to aliasing or distortion when propagating through downsampling layers such as strided-convolution. Here, we propose a novel Spatial Frequency Modulation (SFM) that modulates high-frequency features to a lower frequency before downsampling and then demodulates them back during upsampling. Specifically, we implement modulation through adaptive resampling (ARS) and design a lightweight add-on that can densely sample the high-frequency areas to scale up the signal, thereby lowering its frequency in accordance with the Frequency Scaling Property. We also propose Multi-Scale Adaptive Upsampling (MSAU) to demodulate the modulated feature and recover high-frequency information through non-uniform upsampling This module further improves segmentation by explicitly exploiting information interaction between densely and sparsely resampled areas at multiple scales. Both modules can seamlessly integrate with various architectures, extending from convolutional neural networks to transformers. Feature visualization and analysis confirm that our method effectively alleviates aliasing while successfully retaining details after demodulation. Finally, we validate the broad applicability and effectiveness of SFM by extending it to image classification, adversarial robustness, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: As the path toward 6G networks is being charted, the emerging applications have motivated evolutions of network architectures to realize the efficient, reliable, and flexible wireless networks. Among the potential architectures, the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and open radio access network (ORAN) have received increasing interest from both academia and industry. Although the deployment of NTNs ensures coverage, enhances spectral efficiency, and improves the resilience of wireless networks. The high altitude and mobility of NTN present new challenges in the development and operations (DevOps) lifecycle, hindering intelligent and scalable network management due to the lack of native artificial intelligence (AI) capability. With the advantages of ORAN in disaggregation, openness, virtualization, and intelligence, several works propose integrating ORAN principles into the NTN, focusing mainly on ORAN deployment options based on transparent and regenerative systems. However, a holistic view of how to effectively combine ORAN and NTN throughout the DevOps lifecycle is still missing, especially regarding how intelligent ORAN addresses the scalability challenges in NTN. Motivated by this, in this paper, we first provide the background knowledge about ORAN and NTN, outline the state-of-the-art research on ORAN for NTNs, and present the DevOps challenges that motivate the adoption of ORAN solutions. We then propose the ORAN-based NTN framework, discussing its features and architectures in detail. These include the discussion about flexible fronthaul split, RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) enhancement for distributed learning, scalable deployment architecture, and multi-domain service management. Finally, the future research directions, including combinations of the ORAN-based NTN framework and other enabling technologies and schemes, as well as the candidate use cases, are highlighted.

Abstract: Charts are a universally adopted medium for interpreting and communicating data. However, existing chart understanding benchmarks are predominantly English-centric, limiting their accessibility and applicability to global audiences. In this paper, we present PolyChartQA, the first large-scale multilingual chart question answering benchmark covering 22,606 charts and 26,151 question-answering pairs across 10 diverse languages. PolyChartQA is built using a decoupled pipeline that separates chart data from rendering code, allowing multilingual charts to be flexibly generated by simply translating the data and reusing the code. We leverage state-of-the-art LLM-based translation and enforce rigorous quality control in the pipeline to ensure the linguistic and semantic consistency of the generated multilingual charts. PolyChartQA facilitates systematic evaluation of multilingual chart understanding. Experiments on both open- and closed-source large vision-language models reveal a significant performance gap between English and other languages, especially low-resource ones with non-Latin scripts. This benchmark lays a foundation for advancing globally inclusive vision-language models.

In the proposed method, trainable rank decomposition matrices are injected into each layer of the ViT architecture, and moreover, the patch embedding layer is not frozen, unlike in the case of the conventional low-rank adaptation methods. The proposed method allows us not only to reduce the number of trainable parameters but to also maintain almost the same accuracy as that of full-time tuning.

Abstract: With recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, effectively generating multiple instances within a single image prompt has become a crucial challenge. Existing methods, while successful in generating positions of individual instances, often struggle to account for relationship discrepancy and multiple attributes leakage. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the relation-aware disentangled learning (RaDL) framework. RaDL enhances instance-specific attributes through learnable parameters and generates relation-aware image features via Relation Attention, utilizing action verbs extracted from the global prompt. Through extensive evaluations on benchmarks such as COCO-Position, COCO-MIG, and DrawBench, we demonstrate that RaDL outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in positional accuracy, multiple attributes consideration, and the relationships between instances. Our results present RaDL as the solution for generating images that consider both the relationships and multiple attributes of each instance within the multi-instance image.

Abstract: Writing GPU kernels is a challenging task and critical for AI systems' efficiency. It is also highly iterative: domain experts write code and improve performance through execution feedback. Moreover, it presents verifiable rewards like correctness and speedup, making it a natural environment to apply Reinforcement Learning (RL). To explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of this process into training, we develop a flexible multi-turn RL recipe that addresses unique challenges encountered in real-world settings, such as learning from long trajectories and effective reward attribution across turns. We present Kevin - K(ernel D)evin, the first model trained with multi-turn RL for CUDA kernel generation and optimization. In our evaluation setup, Kevin shows significant gains over its base model (QwQ-32B), improving correctness of generated kernels (in pure CUDA) from 56% to 82% and mean speedup from 0.53x to 1.10x of baseline (PyTorch Eager), and surpassing frontier models like o4-mini (0.78x). Finally, we study its behavior across test-time scaling axes: we found scaling serial refinement more beneficial than parallel sampling. In particular, when given more refinement turns, Kevin shows a higher rate of improvement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their deployment is challenging due to the substantial computational resources required. Power-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this difficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently dequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on GPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit manipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization framework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in extremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference through more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the quantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i) initialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii) refine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT post-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer quantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our PoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating point inference and leads to $3.67\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and $1.63\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.

Abstract: As online communication increasingly incorporates under-represented languages and colloquial dialects, standard translation systems often fail to preserve local slang, code-mixing, and culturally embedded markers of harmful speech. Translating toxic content between low-resource language pairs poses additional challenges due to scarce parallel data and safety filters that sanitize offensive expressions. In this work, we propose a reproducible, two-stage framework for toxicity-preserving translation, demonstrated on a code-mixed Singlish safety corpus. First, we perform human-verified few-shot prompt engineering: we iteratively curate and rank annotator-selected Singlish-target examples to capture nuanced slang, tone, and toxicity. Second, we optimize model-prompt pairs by benchmarking several large language models using semantic similarity via direct and back-translation. Quantitative human evaluation confirms the effectiveness and efficiency of our pipeline. Beyond improving translation quality, our framework contributes to the safety of multicultural LLMs by supporting culturally sensitive moderation and benchmarking in low-resource contexts. By positioning Singlish as a testbed for inclusive NLP, we underscore the importance of preserving sociolinguistic nuance in real-world applications such as content moderation and regional platform governance.

Abstract: Scaling deep neural networks (NN) of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms has been shown to enhance performance when feature extraction networks are used but the gained performance comes at the significant expense of increased computational and memory complexity. Neural network pruning methods have successfully addressed this challenge in supervised learning. However, their application to RL is underexplored. We propose an approach to integrate simultaneous training and pruning within advanced RL methods, in particular to RL algorithms enhanced by the Online Feature Extractor Network (OFENet). Our networks (XiNet) are trained to solve stochastic optimization problems over the RL networks' weights and the parameters of variational Bernoulli distributions for 0/1 Random Variables $\xi$ scaling each unit in the networks. The stochastic problem formulation induces regularization terms that promote convergence of the variational parameters to 0 when a unit contributes little to the performance. In this case, the corresponding structure is rendered permanently inactive and pruned from its network. We propose a cost-aware, sparsity-promoting regularization scheme, tailored to the DenseNet architecture of OFENets expressing the parameter complexity of involved networks in terms of the parameters of the RVs in these networks. Then, when matching this cost with the regularization terms, the many hyperparameters associated with them are automatically selected, effectively combining the RL objectives and network compression. We evaluate our method on continuous control benchmarks (MuJoCo) and the Soft Actor-Critic RL agent, demonstrating that OFENets can be pruned considerably with minimal loss in performance. Furthermore, our results confirm that pruning large networks during training produces more efficient and higher performing RL agents rather than training smaller networks from scratch.

Abstract: Neural certificates have emerged as a powerful tool in cyber-physical systems control, providing witnesses of correctness. These certificates, such as barrier functions, often learned alongside control policies, once verified, serve as mathematical proofs of system safety. However, traditional formal verification of their defining conditions typically faces scalability challenges due to exhaustive state-space exploration. To address this challenge, we propose a lightweight runtime monitoring framework that integrates real-time verification and does not require access to the underlying control policy. Our monitor observes the system during deployment and performs on-the-fly verification of the certificate over a lookahead region to ensure safety within a finite prediction horizon. We instantiate this framework for ReLU-based control barrier functions and demonstrate its practical effectiveness in a case study. Our approach enables timely detection of safety violations and incorrect certificates with minimal overhead, providing an effective but lightweight alternative to the static verification of the certificates.

Abstract: High-risk traffic zones such as intersections are a major cause of collisions. This study leverages deep generative models to enhance the safety of autonomous vehicles in an intersection context. We train a 1000-step denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate collision-causing sensor noise sequences for an autonomous vehicle navigating a four-way intersection based on the current relative position and velocity of an intruder. Using the generative adversarial architecture, the 1000-step model is distilled into a single-step denoising diffusion model which demonstrates fast inference speed while maintaining similar sampling quality. We demonstrate one possible application of the single-step model in building a robust planner for the autonomous vehicle. The planner uses the single-step model to efficiently sample potential failure cases based on the currently measured traffic state to inform its decision-making. Through simulation experiments, the robust planner demonstrates significantly lower failure rate and delay rate compared with the baseline Intelligent Driver Model controller.

Abstract: Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within multimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use preprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal fraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual information. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful capabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant challenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with graph structures. In this paper, we propose a \textbf{M}ulti-level \textbf{L}LM \textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In MLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to enhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure information and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a multi-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and relation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the fraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of the fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world datasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud detection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced computer vision, demonstrating strong performance across various tasks. However, the attention mechanism in ViTs makes each layer function as a low-pass filter, and the stacked-layer architecture in existing transformers suffers from frequency vanishing. This leads to the loss of critical details and textures. We propose a novel, circuit-theory-inspired strategy called Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation (FDAM), which can be easily plugged into ViTs. FDAM directly modulates the overall frequency response of ViTs and consists of two techniques: Attention Inversion (AttInv) and Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale). Since circuit theory uses low-pass filters as fundamental elements, we introduce AttInv, a method that generates complementary high-pass filtering by inverting the low-pass filter in the attention matrix, and dynamically combining the two. We further design FreqScale to weight different frequency components for fine-grained adjustments to the target response function. Through feature similarity analysis and effective rank evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach avoids representation collapse, leading to consistent performance improvements across various models, including SegFormer, DeiT, and MaskDINO. These improvements are evident in tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Additionally, we apply our method to remote sensing detection, achieving state-of-the-art results in single-scale settings.

<title>Dual form Complementary Masking for Domain-Adaptive Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Recent works have correlated Masked Image Modeling (MIM) with consistency regularization in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). However, they merely treat masking as a special form of deformation on the input images and neglect the theoretical analysis, which leads to a superficial understanding of masked reconstruction and insufficient exploitation of its potential in enhancing feature extraction and representation learning. In this paper, we reframe masked reconstruction as a sparse signal reconstruction problem and theoretically prove that the dual form of complementary masks possesses superior capabilities in extracting domain-agnostic image features. Based on this compelling insight, we propose MaskTwins, a simple yet effective UDA framework that integrates masked reconstruction directly into the main training pipeline. MaskTwins uncovers intrinsic structural patterns that persist across disparate domains by enforcing consistency between predictions of images masked in complementary ways, enabling domain generalization in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of MaskTwins over baseline methods in natural and biological image segmentation. These results demonstrate the significant advantages of MaskTwins in extracting domain-invariant features without the need for separate pre-training, offering a new paradigm for domain-adaptive segmentation.

<title>DUSE: A Data Expansion Framework for Low-resource Automatic Modulation Recognition based on Active Learning</title>

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have made remarkable achievements in the field of automatic modulation recognition (AMR), these models often require a large amount of labeled data for training. However, in many practical scenarios, the available target domain data is scarce and difficult to meet the needs of model training. The most direct way is to collect data manually and perform expert annotation, but the high time and labor costs are unbearable. Another common method is data augmentation. Although it can enrich training samples to a certain extent, it does not introduce new data and therefore cannot fundamentally solve the problem of data scarcity. To address these challenges, we introduce a data expansion framework called Dynamic Uncertainty-driven Sample Expansion (DUSE). Specifically, DUSE uses an uncertainty scoring function to filter out useful samples from relevant AMR datasets and employs an active learning strategy to continuously refine the scorer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUSE consistently outperforms 8 coreset selection baselines in both class-balance and class-imbalance settings. Besides, DUSE exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization for unseen models.

Abstract: Quantifiable image patterns associated with disease progression and treatment response are critical tools for guiding individual treatment, and for developing novel therapies. Here, we show that unsupervised machine learning can identify a pattern vocabulary of liver tissue in magnetic resonance images that quantifies treatment response in diffuse liver disease. Deep clustering networks simultaneously encode and cluster patches of medical images into a low-dimensional latent space to establish a tissue vocabulary. The resulting tissue types capture differential tissue change and its location in the liver associated with treatment response. We demonstrate the utility of the vocabulary on a randomized controlled trial cohort of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients. First, we use the vocabulary to compare longitudinal liver change in a placebo and a treatment cohort. Results show that the method identifies specific liver tissue change pathways associated with treatment, and enables a better separation between treatment groups than established non-imaging measures. Moreover, we show that the vocabulary can predict biopsy derived features from non-invasive imaging data. We validate the method on a separate replication cohort to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method.

<title>SS-DC: Spatial-Spectral Decoupling and Coupling Across Visible-Infrared Gap for Domain Adaptive Object Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12017</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptive object detection (UDAOD) from the visible domain to the infrared (RGB-IR) domain is challenging. Existing methods regard the RGB domain as a unified domain and neglect the multiple subdomains within it, such as daytime, nighttime, and foggy scenes. We argue that decoupling the domain-invariant (DI) and domain-specific (DS) features across these multiple subdomains is beneficial for RGB-IR domain adaptation. To this end, this paper proposes a new SS-DC framework based on a decoupling-coupling strategy. In terms of decoupling, we design a Spectral Adaptive Idempotent Decoupling (SAID) module in the aspect of spectral decomposition. Due to the style and content information being highly embedded in different frequency bands, this module can decouple DI and DS components more accurately and interpretably. A novel filter bank-based spectral processing paradigm and a self-distillation-driven decoupling loss are proposed to improve the spectral domain decoupling. In terms of coupling, a new spatial-spectral coupling method is proposed, which realizes joint coupling through spatial and spectral DI feature pyramids. Meanwhile, this paper introduces DS from decoupling to reduce the domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the baseline performance and outperform existing UDAOD methods on multiple RGB-IR datasets, including a new experimental protocol proposed in this paper based on the FLIR-ADAS dataset.

<title>Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided Multi-view Novel Class Discovery</title>

arXiv:2507.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of novel class discovery (NCD), which aims to cluster novel classes by leveraging knowledge from disjoint known classes. While recent advances have made significant progress in this area, existing NCD methods face two major limitations. First, they primarily focus on single-view data (e.g., images), overlooking the increasingly common multi-view data, such as multi-omics datasets used in disease diagnosis. Second, their reliance on pseudo-labels to supervise novel class clustering often results in unstable performance, as pseudo-label quality is highly sensitive to factors such as data noise and feature dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Intra-view and Inter-view Correlation Guided Multi-view Novel Class Discovery (IICMVNCD), which is the first attempt to explore NCD in multi-view setting so far. Specifically, at the intra-view level, leveraging the distributional similarity between known and novel classes, we employ matrix factorization to decompose features into view-specific shared base matrices and factor matrices. The base matrices capture distributional consistency among the two datasets, while the factor matrices model pairwise relationships between samples. At the inter-view level, we utilize view relationships among known classes to guide the clustering of novel classes. This includes generating predicted labels through the weighted fusion of factor matrices and dynamically adjusting view weights of known classes based on the supervision loss, which are then transferred to novel class learning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) aims to construct a robust system that can withstand diverse attacks. While recent efforts have concentrated mainly on cross-domain generalization, two significant challenges persist: limited semantic understanding of attack types and training redundancy across domains. We address the first by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) to enhance the perception of visual input. For the second challenge, we employ a meta-domain strategy to learn a unified model that generalizes well across multiple domains. Our proposed InstructFLIP is a novel instruction-tuned framework that leverages VLMs to enhance generalization via textual guidance trained solely on a single domain. At its core, InstructFLIP explicitly decouples instructions into content and style components, where content-based instructions focus on the essential semantics of spoofing, and style-based instructions consider variations related to the environment and camera characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of InstructFLIP by outperforming SOTA models in accuracy and substantially reducing training redundancy across diverse domains in FAS.

Abstract: This submission to the binary AI detection task is based on a modular stylometric pipeline, where: public spaCy models are used for text preprocessing (including tokenisation, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging, and morphology annotation) and extracting several thousand features (frequencies of n-grams of the above linguistic annotations); light-gradient boosting machines are used as the classifier. We collect a large corpus of more than 500 000 machine-generated texts for the classifier's training. We explore several parameter options to increase the classifier's capacity and take advantage of that training set. Our approach follows the non-neural, computationally inexpensive but explainable approach found effective previously.

Abstract: Coreference Resolution systems are typically evaluated on benchmarks containing small- to medium-scale documents. When it comes to evaluating long texts, however, existing benchmarks, such as LitBank, remain limited in length and do not adequately assess system capabilities at the book scale, i.e., when co-referring mentions span hundreds of thousands of tokens. To fill this gap, we first put forward a novel automatic pipeline that produces high-quality Coreference Resolution annotations on full narrative texts. Then, we adopt this pipeline to create the first book-scale coreference benchmark, BOOKCOREF, with an average document length of more than 200,000 tokens. We carry out a series of experiments showing the robustness of our automatic procedure and demonstrating the value of our resource, which enables current long-document coreference systems to gain up to +20 CoNLL-F1 points when evaluated on full books. Moreover, we report on the new challenges introduced by this unprecedented book-scale setting, highlighting that current models fail to deliver the same performance they achieve on smaller documents. We release our data and code to encourage research and development of new book-scale Coreference Resolution systems at https://github.com/sapienzanlp/bookcoref.

<title>From Static to Intelligent: Evolving SaaS Pricing with LLMs</title>

Abstract: The SaaS paradigm has revolutionized software distribution by offering flexible pricing options to meet diverse customer needs. However, the rapid expansion of the SaaS market has introduced significant complexity for DevOps teams, who must manually manage and evolve pricing structures, an approach that is both time-consuming and prone to errors. The absence of automated tools for pricing analysis restricts the ability to efficiently evaluate, optimize, and scale these models. This paper proposes leveraging intelligent pricing (iPricing), dynamic, machine-readable pricing models, as a solution to these challenges. Intelligent pricing enables competitive analysis, streamlines operational decision-making, and supports continuous pricing evolution in response to market dynamics, leading to improved efficiency and accuracy. We present an LLM-driven approach that automates the transformation of static HTML pricing into iPricing, significantly improving efficiency and consistency while minimizing human error. Our implementation, AI4Pricing2Yaml, features a basic Information Extractor that uses web scraping and LLMs technologies to extract essential pricing components, plans, features, usage limits, and add-ons, from SaaS websites. Validation against a dataset of 30 distinct commercial SaaS, encompassing over 150 intelligent pricings, demonstrates the system's effectiveness in extracting the desired elements across all steps. However, challenges remain in addressing hallucinations, complex structures, and dynamic content. This work highlights the potential of automating intelligent pricing transformation to streamline SaaS pricing management, offering implications for improved consistency and scalability in an increasingly intricate pricing landscape. Future research will focus on refining extraction capabilities and enhancing the system's adaptability to a wider range of SaaS websites.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition systems (FRSs) pose serious security and privacy threats, especially when these systems are used for identity verification. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating adversarial faces-synthetic facial images that are visually distinct yet recognized as a target identity by the FRS. Unlike iterative optimization-based approaches (e.g., gradient descent or other iterative solvers), our method leverages the structural characteristics of the FRS feature space. We figure out that individuals sharing the same attribute (e.g., gender or race) form an attributed subsphere. By utilizing such subspheres, our method achieves both non-adaptiveness and a remarkably small number of queries. This eliminates the need for relying on transferability and open-source surrogate models, which have been a typical strategy when repeated adaptive queries to commercial FRSs are impossible. Despite requiring only a single non-adaptive query consisting of 100 face images, our method achieves a high success rate of over 93% against AWS's CompareFaces API at its default threshold. Furthermore, unlike many existing attacks that perturb a given image, our method can deliberately produce adversarial faces that impersonate the target identity while exhibiting high-level attributes chosen by the adversary.

Abstract: Coordinated online behavior, which spans from beneficial collective actions to harmful manipulation such as disinformation campaigns, has become a key focus in digital ecosystem analysis. Traditional methods often rely on monomodal approaches, focusing on single types of interactions like co-retweets or co-hashtags, or consider multiple modalities independently of each other. However, these approaches may overlook the complex dynamics inherent in multimodal coordination. This study compares different ways of operationalizing the detection of multimodal coordinated behavior. It examines the trade-off between weakly and strongly integrated multimodal models, highlighting the balance between capturing broader coordination patterns and identifying tightly coordinated behavior. By comparing monomodal and multimodal approaches, we assess the unique contributions of different data modalities and explore how varying implementations of multimodality impact detection outcomes. Our findings reveal that not all the modalities provide distinct insights, but that with a multimodal approach we can get a more comprehensive understanding of coordination dynamics. This work enhances the ability to detect and analyze coordinated online behavior, offering new perspectives for safeguarding the integrity of digital platforms.

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, from image classification to natural langurage processing, but pose significant challenges for deployment at edge. This has sparked growing interest in developing practical and efficient strategies for bringing foundation models to edge environments. In this work, we propose PRISM, a communication-efficient and compute-aware strategy for distributed Transformer inference on edge devices. Our method leverages a Segment Means representation to approximate intermediate output features, drastically reducing inter-device communication. Additionally, we restructure the self-attention mechanism to eliminate redundant computations caused by per-device Key/Value calculation in position-wise partitioning and design a partition-aware causal masking scheme tailored for autoregressive models. We evaluate PRISM on ViT, BERT, and GPT-2 across diverse datasets, namely CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-1k, GLUE, and CBT. Our results demonstrate substantial reductions in communication overhead (up to 99.2% for BERT at compression rate CR = 128) and per-device computation (51.24% for BERT at the same setting), with only minor accuracy degradation. This method offers a scalable and practical solution for deploying foundation models in distributed resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Low-light images suffer from complex degradation, and existing enhancement methods often encode all degradation factors within a single latent space. This leads to highly entangled features and strong black-box characteristics, making the model prone to shortcut learning. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a wavelet-based low-light stereo image enhancement method with feature space decoupling. Our insight comes from the following findings: (1) Wavelet transform enables the independent processing of low-frequency and high-frequency information. (2) Illumination adjustment can be achieved by adjusting the low-frequency component of a low-light image, extracted through multi-level wavelet decomposition. Thus, by using wavelet transform the feature space is decomposed into a low-frequency branch for illumination adjustment and multiple high-frequency branches for texture enhancement. Additionally, stereo low-light image enhancement can extract useful cues from another view to improve enhancement. To this end, we propose a novel high-frequency guided cross-view interaction module (HF-CIM) that operates within high-frequency branches rather than across the entire feature space, effectively extracting valuable image details from the other view. Furthermore, to enhance the high-frequency information, a detail and texture enhancement module (DTEM) is proposed based on cross-attention mechanism. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of images with uniform illumination and images with non-uniform illumination. Experimental results on both real and synthetic images indicate that our algorithm offers significant advantages in light adjustment while effectively recovering high-frequency information. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Cherisherr/WDCI-Net.git.

Abstract: We introduce BenchRL-QAS, a unified benchmarking framework for systematically evaluating reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in quantum architecture search (QAS) across diverse variational quantum algorithm tasks and system sizes ranging from 2- to 8-qubit. Our study benchmarks nine RL agents including both value-based and policy-gradient methods on representative quantum problems such as variational quantum eigensolver, variational quantum state diagonalization, quantum classification, and state preparation, spanning both noiseless and realistic noisy regimes. We propose a weighted ranking metric that balances accuracy, circuit depth, gate count, and computational efficiency, enabling fair and comprehensive comparison. Our results first reveal that RL-based quantum classifier outperforms baseline variational classifiers. Then we conclude that no single RL algorithm is universally optimal when considering a set of QAS tasks; algorithmic performance is highly context-dependent, varying with task structure, qubit count, and noise. This empirical finding provides strong evidence for the "no free lunch" principle in RL-based quantum circuit design and highlights the necessity of tailored algorithm selection and systematic benchmarking for advancing quantum circuit synthesis. This work represents the most comprehensive RL-QAS benchmarking effort to date, and BenchRL-QAS along with all experimental data are made publicly available to support reproducibility and future research https://github.com/azhar-ikhtiarudin/bench-rlqas.

Abstract: Modern digitised approaches have dramatically changed the preservation and restoration of cultural treasures, integrating computer scientists into multidisciplinary projects with ease. Machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision techniques have revolutionised developing sectors like 3D reconstruction, picture inpainting,IoT-based methods, genetic algorithms, and image processing with the integration of computer scientists into multidisciplinary initiatives. We suggest three cutting-edge techniques in recognition of the special qualities of Indian monuments, which are famous for their architectural skill and aesthetic appeal. First is the Fractal Convolution methodology, a segmentation method based on image processing that successfully reveals subtle architectural patterns within these irreplaceable cultural buildings. The second is a revolutionary Self-Sensitive Tile Filling (SSTF) method created especially for West Bengal's mesmerising Bankura Terracotta Temples with a brand-new data augmentation method called MosaicSlice on the third. Furthermore, we delve deeper into the Super Resolution strategy to upscale the images without losing significant amount of quality. Our methods allow for the development of seamless region-filling and highly detailed tiles while maintaining authenticity using a novel data augmentation strategy within affordable costs introducing automation. By providing effective solutions that preserve the delicate balance between tradition and innovation, this study improves the subject and eventually ensures unrivalled efficiency and aesthetic excellence in cultural heritage protection. The suggested approaches advance the field into an era of unmatched efficiency and aesthetic quality while carefully upholding the delicate equilibrium between tradition and innovation.

<title>Selective Quantization Tuning for ONNX Models</title>

Abstract: Quantization is a process that reduces the precision of deep neural network models to lower model size and computational demands, often at the cost of accuracy. However, fully quantized models may exhibit sub-optimal performance below acceptable levels and face deployment challenges on low-end hardware accelerators due to practical constraints. To address these issues, quantization can be selectively applied to only a subset of layers, but selecting which layers to exclude is non-trivial. To this direction, we propose TuneQn, a suite enabling selective quantization, deployment and execution of ONNX models across various CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and multi-objective optimization. TuneQn generates selectively quantized ONNX models, deploys them on different hardware, measures performance on metrics like accuracy and size, performs Pareto Front minimization to identify the best model candidate and visualizes the results. To demonstrate the effectiveness of TuneQn, we evaluated TuneQn on four ONNX models with two quantization settings across CPU and GPU devices. As a result, we demonstrated that our utility effectively performs selective quantization and tuning, selecting ONNX model candidates with up to a $54.14$% reduction in accuracy loss compared to the fully quantized model, and up to a $72.9$% model size reduction compared to the original model.

<title>Quantize More, Lose Less: Autoregressive Generation from Residually Quantized Speech Representations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12197</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis has seen renewed progress under the discrete modeling paradigm. Existing autoregressive approaches often rely on single-codebook representations, which suffer from significant information loss. Even with post-hoc refinement techniques such as flow matching, these methods fail to recover fine-grained details (e.g., prosodic nuances, speaker-specific timbres), especially in challenging scenarios like singing voice or music synthesis. We propose QTTS, a novel TTS framework built upon our new audio codec, QDAC. The core innovation of QDAC lies in its end-to-end training of an ASR-based auto-regressive network with a GAN, which achieves superior semantic feature disentanglement for scalable, near-lossless compression. QTTS models these discrete codes using two innovative strategies: the Hierarchical Parallel architecture, which uses a dual-AR structure to model inter-codebook dependencies for higher-quality synthesis, and the Delay Multihead approach, which employs parallelized prediction with a fixed delay to accelerate inference speed. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher synthesis quality and better preserves expressive content compared to baseline. This suggests that scaling up compression via multi-codebook modeling is a promising direction for high-fidelity, general-purpose speech and audio generation.

Abstract: Many current state-of-the-art models for sequential recommendations are based on transformer architectures. Interpretation and explanation of such black box models is an important research question, as a better understanding of their internals can help understand, influence, and control their behavior, which is very important in a variety of real-world applications. Recently sparse autoencoders (SAE) have been shown to be a promising unsupervised approach for extracting interpretable features from language models. These autoencoders learn to reconstruct hidden states of the transformer's internal layers from sparse linear combinations of directions in their activation space.
  This paper is focused on the application of SAE to the sequential recommendation domain. We show that this approach can be successfully applied to the transformer trained on a sequential recommendation task: learned directions turn out to be more interpretable and monosemantic than the original hidden state dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the features learned by SAE can be used to effectively and flexibly control the model's behavior, providing end-users with a straightforward method to adjust their recommendations to different custom scenarios and contexts.

Abstract: Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces deep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how concepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study investigates how four different generative AI models understand and express ugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these representations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through iterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across four AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes within the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our findings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old white male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical biases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups inadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes onto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite supposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional physical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs. These findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal representations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and paradoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical AI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI development.

<title>Looking for Fairness in Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Recommender systems can be found everywhere today, shaping our everyday experience whenever we're consuming content, ordering food, buying groceries online, or even just reading the news. Let's imagine we're in the process of building a recommender system to make content suggestions to users on social media. When thinking about fairness, it becomes clear there are several perspectives to consider: the users asking for tailored suggestions, the content creators hoping for some limelight, and society at large, navigating the repercussions of algorithmic recommendations. A shared fairness concern across all three is the emergence of filter bubbles, a side-effect that takes place when recommender systems are almost "too good", making recommendations so tailored that users become inadvertently confined to a narrow set of opinions/themes and isolated from alternative ideas. From the user's perspective, this is akin to manipulation. From the small content creator's perspective, this is an obstacle preventing them access to a whole range of potential fans. From society's perspective, the potential consequences are far-reaching, influencing collective opinions, social behavior and political decisions. How can our recommender system be fine-tuned to avoid the creation of filter bubbles, and ensure a more inclusive and diverse content landscape? Approaching this problem involves defining one (or more) performance metric to represent diversity, and tweaking our recommender system's performance through the lens of fairness. By incorporating this metric into our evaluation framework, we aim to strike a balance between personalized recommendations and the broader societal goal of fostering rich and varied cultures and points of view.

<title>Improving Contextual ASR via Multi-grained Fusion with Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12252</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: While end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models have shown impressive performance in transcribing general speech, they often struggle to accurately recognize contextually relevant keywords, such as proper nouns or user-specific entities.
  Previous approaches have explored leveraging keyword dictionaries in the textual modality to improve keyword recognition, either through token-level fusion that guides token-by-token generation or phrase-level fusion that enables direct copying of keyword phrases.
  However, these methods operate at different granularities and have their own limitations.
  In this paper, we propose a novel multi-grained fusion approach that jointly leverages the strengths of both token-level and phrase-level fusion with Large Language Models (LLMs).
  Our approach incorporates a late-fusion strategy that elegantly combines ASR's acoustic information with LLM's rich contextual knowledge, balancing fine-grained token precision with holistic phrase-level understanding.
  Experiments on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on keyword-related metrics while preserving high accuracy on non-keyword text.
  Ablation studies further confirm that the token-level and phrase-level components both contribute significantly to the performance gains, complementing each other in our joint multi-grained framework.
  The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/.

Abstract: For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular, rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding. Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues. Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data integration processes and interoperability across institutions.

<title>A Framework for Nonstationary Gaussian Processes with Neural Network Parameters</title>

Abstract: Gaussian processes have become a popular tool for nonparametric regression because of their flexibility and uncertainty quantification. However, they often use stationary kernels, which limit the expressiveness of the model and may be unsuitable for many datasets. We propose a framework that uses nonstationary kernels whose parameters vary across the feature space, modeling these parameters as the output of a neural network that takes the features as input. The neural network and Gaussian process are trained jointly using the chain rule to calculate derivatives. Our method clearly describes the behavior of the nonstationary parameters and is compatible with approximation methods for scaling to large datasets. It is flexible and easily adapts to different nonstationary kernels without needing to redesign the optimization procedure. Our methods are implemented with the GPyTorch library and can be readily modified. We test a nonstationary variance and noise variant of our method on several machine learning datasets and find that it achieves better accuracy and log-score than both a stationary model and a hierarchical model approximated with variational inference. Similar results are observed for a model with only nonstationary variance. We also demonstrate our approach's ability to recover the nonstationary parameters of a spatial dataset.

<title>Site-Level Fine-Tuning with Progressive Layer Freezing: Towards Robust Prediction of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia from Day-1 Chest Radiographs in Extremely Preterm Infants</title>

Abstract: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease affecting 35% of extremely low birth weight infants. Defined by oxygen dependence at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, it causes lifelong respiratory complications. However, preventive interventions carry severe risks, including neurodevelopmental impairment, ventilator-induced lung injury, and systemic complications. Therefore, early BPD prognosis and prediction of BPD outcome is crucial to avoid unnecessary toxicity in low risk infants. Admission radiographs of extremely preterm infants are routinely acquired within 24h of life and could serve as a non-invasive prognostic tool. In this work, we developed and investigated a deep learning approach using chest X-rays from 163 extremely low-birth-weight infants ($\leq$32 weeks gestation, 401-999g) obtained within 24 hours of birth. We fine-tuned a ResNet-50 pretrained specifically on adult chest radiographs, employing progressive layer freezing with discriminative learning rates to prevent overfitting and evaluated a CutMix augmentation and linear probing. For moderate/severe BPD outcome prediction, our best performing model with progressive freezing, linear probing and CutMix achieved an AUROC of 0.78 $\pm$ 0.10, balanced accuracy of 0.69 $\pm$ 0.10, and an F1-score of 0.67 $\pm$ 0.11. In-domain pre-training significantly outperformed ImageNet initialization (p = 0.031) which confirms domain-specific pretraining to be important for BPD outcome prediction. Routine IRDS grades showed limited prognostic value (AUROC 0.57 $\pm$ 0.11), confirming the need of learned markers. Our approach demonstrates that domain-specific pretraining enables accurate BPD prediction from routine day-1 radiographs. Through progressive freezing and linear probing, the method remains computationally feasible for site-level implementation and future federated learning deployments.

Abstract: Advancements in LLMs have enhanced task automation in software engineering; however, current evaluations primarily focus on natural language tasks, overlooking code quality. Most benchmarks prioritize high-level reasoning over executable code and real-world performance, leaving gaps in understanding true capabilities and risks associated with these models in production. To address this issue, we propose MERA Code, a new addition to the MERA benchmark family, specifically focused on evaluating code for the latest code generation LLMs in Russian. This benchmark includes 11 evaluation tasks that span 8 programming languages. Our proposed evaluation methodology features a taxonomy that outlines the practical coding skills necessary for models to complete these tasks. The benchmark comprises an open-source codebase for users to conduct MERA assessments, a scoring system compatible with various programming environments, and a platform featuring a leaderboard and submission system. We evaluate open LLMs and frontier API models, analyzing their limitations in terms of practical coding tasks in non-English languages. We are publicly releasing MERA to guide future research, anticipate groundbreaking features in model development, and standardize evaluation procedures.

Abstract: Text anomaly detection is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP), with applications spanning fraud detection, misinformation identification, spam detection and content moderation, etc. Despite significant advances in large language models (LLMs) and anomaly detection algorithms, the absence of standardized and comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating the existing anomaly detection methods on text data limits rigorous comparison and development of innovative approaches. This work performs a comprehensive empirical study and introduces a benchmark for text anomaly detection, leveraging embeddings from diverse pre-trained language models across a wide array of text datasets. Our work systematically evaluates the effectiveness of embedding-based text anomaly detection by incorporating (1) early language models (GloVe, BERT); (2) multiple LLMs (LLaMa-2, LLama-3, Mistral, OpenAI (small, ada, large)); (3) multi-domain text datasets (news, social media, scientific publications); (4) comprehensive evaluation metrics (AUROC, AUPRC). Our experiments reveal a critical empirical insight: embedding quality significantly governs anomaly detection efficacy, and deep learning-based approaches demonstrate no performance advantage over conventional shallow algorithms (e.g., KNN, Isolation Forest) when leveraging LLM-derived embeddings.In addition, we observe strongly low-rank characteristics in cross-model performance matrices, which enables an efficient strategy for rapid model evaluation (or embedding evaluation) and selection in practical applications. Furthermore, by open-sourcing our benchmark toolkit that includes all embeddings from different models and code at https://github.com/jicongfan/Text-Anomaly-Detection-Benchmark, this work provides a foundation for future research in robust and scalable text anomaly detection systems.

Abstract: The data privacy constraint in online continual learning (OCL), where the data can be seen only once, complicates the catastrophic forgetting problem in streaming data. A common approach applied by the current SOTAs in OCL is with the use of memory saving exemplars or features from previous classes to be replayed in the current task. On the other hand, the prompt-based approach performs excellently in continual learning but with the cost of a growing number of trainable parameters. The first approach may not be applicable in practice due to data openness policy, while the second approach has the issue of throughput associated with the streaming data. In this study, we propose a novel prompt-based method for online continual learning that includes 4 main components: (1) single light-weight prompt generator as a general knowledge, (2) trainable scaler-and-shifter as specific knowledge, (3) pre-trained model (PTM) generalization preserving, and (4) hard-soft updates mechanism. Our proposed method achieves significantly higher performance than the current SOTAs in CIFAR100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB dataset. Our complexity analysis shows that our method requires a relatively smaller number of parameters and achieves moderate training time, inference time, and throughput. For further study, the source code of our method is available at https://github.com/anwarmaxsum/PROL.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks and domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However, despite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a dearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware description languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the performance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization using various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter, an in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally equivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these models across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their suitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose Chain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves generating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem statement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These steps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or code) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our experiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the standard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This method not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization but also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs for VHDL.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning-trained Large Reasoning Models (LRMs, e.g., Deepseek-R1) demonstrate advanced reasoning capabilities in the evolving Large Language Models (LLMs) domain, their susceptibility to security threats remains a critical vulnerability. This weakness is particularly evident in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation processes, where adversarial methods like backdoor prompt attacks can systematically subvert the model's core reasoning mechanisms. The emerging Chain-of-Thought Attack (CoTA) reveals this vulnerability through exploiting prompt controllability, simultaneously degrading both CoT safety and task performance with low-cost interventions. To address this compounded security-performance vulnerability, we propose Thought Purity (TP): a defense paradigm that systematically strengthens resistance to malicious content while preserving operational efficacy. Our solution achieves this through three synergistic components: (1) a safety-optimized data processing pipeline (2) reinforcement learning-enhanced rule constraints (3) adaptive monitoring metrics. Our approach establishes the first comprehensive defense mechanism against CoTA vulnerabilities in reinforcement learning-aligned reasoning systems, significantly advancing the security-functionality equilibrium for next-generation AI architectures.

Abstract: We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is, for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural polar decoder (NPD) for deletion channels with a constant deletion rate. Existing polar decoders for deletion channels exhibit high computational complexity of $O(N^4)$, where $N$ is the block length. This limits the application of polar codes for deletion channels to short-to-moderate block lengths. In this work, we demonstrate that employing NPDs for deletion channels can reduce the computational complexity. First, we extend the architecture of the NPD to support deletion channels. Specifically, the NPD architecture consists of four neural networks (NNs), each replicating fundamental successive cancellation (SC) decoder operations. To support deletion channels, we change the architecture of only one. The computational complexity of the NPD is $O(AN\log N)$, where the parameter $A$ represents a computational budget determined by the user and is independent of the channel. We evaluate the new extended NPD for deletion channels with deletion rates $\delta\in\{0.01, 0.1\}$ and we verify the NPD with the ground truth given by the trellis decoder by Tal et al. We further show that due to the reduced complexity of the NPD, we are able to incorporate list decoding and further improve performance. We believe that the extended NPD presented here could have applications in future technologies like DNA storage.

Abstract: We introduce Cluster Contrast (CueCo), a novel approach to unsupervised visual representation learning that effectively combines the strengths of contrastive learning and clustering methods. Inspired by recent advancements, CueCo is designed to simultaneously scatter and align feature representations within the feature space. This method utilizes two neural networks, a query and a key, where the key network is updated through a slow-moving average of the query outputs. CueCo employs a contrastive loss to push dissimilar features apart, enhancing inter-class separation, and a clustering objective to pull together features of the same cluster, promoting intra-class compactness. Our method achieves 91.40% top-1 classification accuracy on CIFAR-10, 68.56% on CIFAR-100, and 78.65% on ImageNet-100 using linear evaluation with a ResNet-18 backbone. By integrating contrastive learning with clustering, CueCo sets a new direction for advancing unsupervised visual representation learning.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence (neuro-symbolic AI) excels in logical analysis and reasoning. Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a promising brain-inspired computational model, is integral to neuro-symbolic AI. Various HDC models have been proposed to represent class-instance and class-class relations, but when representing the more complex class-subclass relation, where multiple objects associate different levels of classes and subclasses, they face challenges for factorization, a crucial task for neuro-symbolic AI systems. In this article, we propose FactorHD, a novel HDC model capable of representing and factorizing the complex class-subclass relation efficiently. FactorHD features a symbolic encoding method that embeds an extra memorization clause, preserving more information for multiple objects. In addition, it employs an efficient factorization algorithm that selectively eliminates redundant classes by identifying the memorization clause of the target class. Such model significantly enhances computing efficiency and accuracy in representing and factorizing multiple objects with class-subclass relation, overcoming limitations of existing HDC models such as "superposition catastrophe" and "the problem of 2". Evaluations show that FactorHD achieves approximately 5667x speedup at a representation size of 10^9 compared to existing HDC models. When integrated with the ResNet-18 neural network, FactorHD achieves 92.48% factorization accuracy on the Cifar-10 dataset.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of software libraries poses a considerable hurdle for code generation, necessitating continuous adaptation to frequent version updates while preserving backward compatibility. While existing code evolution benchmarks provide valuable insights, they typically lack execution-based evaluation for generating code compliant with specific library versions. To address this, we introduce GitChameleon, a novel, meticulously curated dataset comprising 328 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests. GitChameleon rigorously evaluates the capacity of contemporary large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered agents, code assistants, and RAG systems to perform version-conditioned code generation that demonstrates functional accuracy through execution. Our extensive evaluations indicate that state-of-the-art systems encounter significant challenges with this task; enterprise models achieving baseline success rates in the 48-51\% range, underscoring the intricacy of the problem. By offering an execution-based benchmark emphasizing the dynamic nature of code libraries, GitChameleon enables a clearer understanding of this challenge and helps guide the development of more adaptable and dependable AI code generation methods. We make the dataset and evaluation code publicly available at https://github.com/mrcabbage972/GitChameleonBenchmark.

Abstract: We investigate whether internal activations in language models can be used to detect arithmetic errors. Starting with a controlled setting of 3-digit addition, we show that simple probes can accurately decode both the model's predicted output and the correct answer from hidden states, regardless of whether the model's output is correct. Building on this, we train lightweight error detectors that predict model correctness with over 90% accuracy. We then extend our analysis to structured chain-of-thought traces on addition-only GSM8K problems and find that probes trained on simple arithmetic generalize well to this more complex setting, revealing consistent internal representations. Finally, we demonstrate that these probes can guide selective re-prompting of erroneous reasoning steps, improving task accuracy with minimal disruption to correct outputs. Our findings suggest that arithmetic errors can be anticipated from internal activations alone, and that simple probes offer a viable path toward lightweight model self-correction.

<title>NOCTA: Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition for Longitudinal Data</title>

Abstract: In many critical applications, resource constraints limit the amount of information that can be gathered to make predictions. For example, in healthcare, patient data often spans diverse features ranging from lab tests to imaging studies. Each feature may carry different information and must be acquired at a respective cost of time, money, or risk to the patient. Moreover, temporal prediction tasks, where both instance features and labels evolve over time, introduce additional complexity in deciding when or what information is important. In this work, we propose NOCTA, a Non-Greedy Objective Cost-Tradeoff Acquisition method that sequentially acquires the most informative features at inference time while accounting for both temporal dynamics and acquisition cost. We first introduce a cohesive estimation target for our NOCTA setting, and then develop two complementary estimators: 1) a non-parametric method based on nearest neighbors to guide the acquisition (NOCTA-NP), and 2) a parametric method that directly predicts the utility of potential acquisitions (NOCTA-P). Experiments on synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that both NOCTA variants outperform existing baselines.

Abstract: Training of autonomous driving systems requires extensive datasets with precise annotations to attain robust performance. Human annotations suffer from imperfections, and multiple iterations are often needed to produce high-quality datasets. However, manually reviewing large datasets is laborious and expensive. In this paper, we introduce AutoVDC (Automated Vision Data Cleaning) framework and investigate the utilization of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automatically identify erroneous annotations in vision datasets, thereby enabling users to eliminate these errors and enhance data quality. We validate our approach using the KITTI and nuImages datasets, which contain object detection benchmarks for autonomous driving. To test the effectiveness of AutoVDC, we create dataset variants with intentionally injected erroneous annotations and observe the error detection rate of our approach. Additionally, we compare the detection rates using different VLMs and explore the impact of VLM fine-tuning on our pipeline. The results demonstrate our method's high performance in error detection and data cleaning experiments, indicating its potential to significantly improve the reliability and accuracy of large-scale production datasets in autonomous driving.

<title>QuRe: Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling in Composed Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) retrieves relevant images based on a reference image and accompanying text describing desired modifications. However, existing CIR methods only focus on retrieving the target image and disregard the relevance of other images. This limitation arises because most methods employing contrastive learning-which treats the target image as positive and all other images in the batch as negatives-can inadvertently include false negatives. This may result in retrieving irrelevant images, reducing user satisfaction even when the target image is retrieved. To address this issue, we propose Query-Relevant Retrieval through Hard Negative Sampling (QuRe), which optimizes a reward model objective to reduce false negatives. Additionally, we introduce a hard negative sampling strategy that selects images positioned between two steep drops in relevance scores following the target image, to effectively filter false negatives. In order to evaluate CIR models on their alignment with human satisfaction, we create Human-Preference FashionIQ (HP-FashionIQ), a new dataset that explicitly captures user preferences beyond target retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance on FashionIQ and CIRR datasets while exhibiting the strongest alignment with human preferences on the HP-FashionIQ dataset.

Abstract: We introduce a Mixture of Raytraced Experts, a stacked Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture which can dynamically select sequences of experts, producing computational graphs of variable width and depth. Existing MoE architectures generally require a fixed amount of computation for a given sample. Our approach, in contrast, yields predictions with increasing accuracy as the computation cycles through the experts' sequence. We train our model by iteratively sampling from a set of candidate experts, unfolding the sequence akin to how Recurrent Neural Networks are trained. Our method does not require load-balancing mechanisms, and preliminary experiments show a reduction in training epochs of 10\% to 40\% with a comparable/higher accuracy. These results point to new research directions in the field of MoEs, allowing the design of potentially faster and more expressive models. The code is available at https://github.com/nutig/RayTracing

<title>Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Structured Enterprise and Internal Data</title>

Abstract: Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR records, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical decision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative capabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows, and challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but often struggle with structured and semi-structured data.
  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval strategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by metadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The framework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains tabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing optimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and conversation memory improve adaptability.
  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5 increased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74), and Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative evaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness (4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate, comprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future work includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based retrieval. The source code will be released at https://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot

Abstract: We propose UTS, a unit-based tissue segmentation framework for histopathology that classifies each fixed-size 32 * 32 tile, rather than each pixel, as the segmentation unit. This approach reduces annotation effort and improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. To implement this approach, we introduce a Multi-Level Vision Transformer (L-ViT), which benefits the multi-level feature representation to capture both fine-grained morphology and global tissue context. Trained to segment breast tissue into three categories (infiltrating tumor, non-neoplastic stroma, and fat), UTS supports clinically relevant tasks such as tumor-stroma quantification and surgical margin assessment. Evaluated on 386,371 tiles from 459 H&amp;E-stained regions, it outperforms U-Net variants and transformer-based baselines. Code and Dataset will be available at GitHub.

<title>Can We Predict Alignment Before Models Finish Thinking? Towards Monitoring Misaligned Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Open-weights reasoning language models generate long chains-of-thought (CoTs) before producing a final response, which improves performance but introduces additional alignment risks, with harmful content often appearing in both the CoTs and the final outputs. In this work, we investigate if we can use CoTs to predict final response misalignment. We evaluate a range of monitoring approaches, including humans, highly-capable large language models, and text classifiers, using either CoT text or activations. First, we find that a simple linear probe trained on CoT activations can significantly outperform all text-based methods in predicting whether a final response will be safe or unsafe. CoT texts are often unfaithful and can mislead humans and classifiers, while model latents (i.e., CoT activations) offer a more reliable predictive signal. Second, the probe makes accurate predictions before reasoning completes, achieving strong performance even when applied to early CoT segments. These findings generalize across model sizes, families, and safety benchmarks, suggesting that lightweight probes could enable real-time safety monitoring and early intervention during generation.

Abstract: Real robot data collection for imitation learning has led to significant advancements in robotic manipulation. However, the requirement for robot hardware in the process fundamentally constrains the scale of the data. In this paper, we explore training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using egocentric human videos. The benefit of using human videos is not only for their scale but more importantly for the richness of scenes and tasks. With a VLA trained on human video that predicts human wrist and hand actions, we can perform Inverse Kinematics and retargeting to convert the human actions to robot actions. We fine-tune the model using a few robot manipulation demonstrations to obtain the robot policy, namely EgoVLA. We propose a simulation benchmark called Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark, where we design diverse bimanual manipulation tasks with demonstrations. We fine-tune and evaluate EgoVLA with Isaac Humanoid Manipulation Benchmark and show significant improvements over baselines and ablate the importance of human data. Videos can be found on our website: https://rchalyang.github.io/EgoVLA

<title>Characterizing State Space Model (SSM) and SSM-Transformer Hybrid Language Model Performance with Long Context Length</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12442</link>

Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.

Abstract: Beyond hallucinations, another problem in program synthesis using LLMs is ambiguity in user intent. We illustrate the ambiguity problem in a networking context for LLM-based incremental configuration synthesis of route-maps and ACLs. These structures frequently overlap in header space, making the relative priority of actions impossible for the LLM to infer without user interaction. Measurements in a large cloud identify complex ACLs with 100's of overlaps, showing ambiguity is a real problem. We propose a prototype system, Clarify, which uses an LLM augmented with a new module called a Disambiguator that helps elicit user intent. On a small synthetic workload, Clarify incrementally synthesizes routing policies after disambiguation and then verifies them. Our treatment of ambiguities is useful more generally when the intent of updates can be correctly synthesized by LLMs, but their integration is ambiguous and can lead to different global behaviors.

Abstract: Modeling latent representations in a hyperspherical space has proven effective for capturing directional similarities in high-dimensional text data, benefiting topic modeling. Variational autoencoder-based neural topic models (VAE-NTMs) commonly adopt the von Mises-Fisher prior to encode hyperspherical structure. However, VAE-NTMs often suffer from posterior collapse, where the KL divergence term in the objective function highly diminishes, leading to ineffective latent representations. To mitigate this issue while modeling hyperspherical structure in the latent space, we propose the Spherical Sliced Wasserstein Autoencoder for Topic Modeling (S2WTM). S2WTM employs a prior distribution supported on the unit hypersphere and leverages the Spherical Sliced-Wasserstein distance to align the aggregated posterior distribution with the prior. Experimental results demonstrate that S2WTM outperforms state-of-the-art topic models, generating more coherent and diverse topics while improving performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Radiologists rely on eye movements to navigate and interpret medical images. A trained radiologist possesses knowledge about the potential diseases that may be present in the images and, when searching, follows a mental checklist to locate them using their gaze. This is a key observation, yet existing models fail to capture the underlying intent behind each fixation. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based approach, RadGazeIntent, designed to model this behavior: having an intention to find something and actively searching for it. Our transformer-based architecture processes both the temporal and spatial dimensions of gaze data, transforming fine-grained fixation features into coarse, meaningful representations of diagnostic intent to interpret radiologists' goals. To capture the nuances of radiologists' varied intention-driven behaviors, we process existing medical eye-tracking datasets to create three intention-labeled subsets: RadSeq (Systematic Sequential Search), RadExplore (Uncertainty-driven Exploration), and RadHybrid (Hybrid Pattern). Experimental results demonstrate RadGazeIntent's ability to predict which findings radiologists are examining at specific moments, outperforming baseline methods across all intention-labeled datasets.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) governance regulates the exercise of authority and control over the management of AI. It aims at leveraging AI through effective use of data and minimization of AI-related cost and risk. While topics such as AI governance and AI ethics are thoroughly discussed on a theoretical, philosophical, societal and regulatory level, there is limited work on AI governance targeted to companies and corporations. This work views AI products as systems, where key functionality is delivered by machine learning (ML) models leveraging (training) data. We derive a conceptual framework by synthesizing literature on AI and related fields such as ML. Our framework decomposes AI governance into governance of data, (ML) models and (AI) systems along four dimensions. It relates to existing IT and data governance frameworks and practices. It can be adopted by practitioners and academics alike. For practitioners the synthesis of mainly research papers, but also practitioner publications and publications of regulatory bodies provides a valuable starting point to implement AI governance, while for academics the paper highlights a number of areas of AI governance that deserve more attention.

Abstract: This paper introduces RACER, the Rational Artificial Intelligence Car-following model Enhanced by Reality, a cutting-edge deep learning car-following model, that satisfies partial derivative constraints, designed to predict Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) driving behavior while staying theoretically feasible. Unlike conventional models, RACER effectively integrates Rational Driving Constraints (RDCs), crucial tenets of actual driving, resulting in strikingly accurate and realistic predictions. Against established models like the Optimal Velocity Relative Velocity (OVRV), a car-following Neural Network (NN), and a car-following Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), RACER excels across key metrics, such as acceleration, velocity, and spacing. Notably, it displays a perfect adherence to the RDCs, registering zero violations, in stark contrast to other models. This study highlights the immense value of incorporating physical constraints within AI models, especially for augmenting safety measures in transportation. It also paves the way for future research to test these models against human driving data, with the potential to guide safer and more rational driving behavior. The versatility of the proposed model, including its potential to incorporate additional derivative constraints and broader architectural applications, enhances its appeal and broadens its impact within the scientific community.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models(LLMs) like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debates on GenAI's transformative nature and regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance, encompassing technical and business perspectives. Although numerous frameworks for governance of AI exist, it is not clear to what extent they apply to GenAI. Our review paper fills this gap by surveying recent works with the purpose of better understanding fundamental characteristics of GenAI and adjusting prior frameworks specifically towards GenAI governance within companies. To do so, it extends Nickerson's framework development processes to include prior conceptualizations. Our framework outlines the scope, objectives, and governance mechanisms tailored to harness business opportunities as well as mitigate risks associated with GenAI integration. Our research contributes a focused approach to GenAI governance, offering practical insights for companies navigating the challenges of GenAI adoption and highlighting research gaps.

Abstract: Living beings are able to solve a wide variety of problems that they encounter rarely or only once. Without the benefit of extensive and repeated experience with these problems, they can solve them in an ad-hoc manner. We call this capacity to always find a solution to a physically solvable problem $hyperadaptability$. To explain how hyperadaptability can be achieved, we propose a theory that frames behavior as the physical manifestation of a self-modifying search procedure. Rather than exploring randomly, our system achieves robust problem-solving by dynamically ordering an infinite set of continuous behaviors according to simplicity and effectiveness. Behaviors are sampled from paths over cognitive graphs, their order determined by a tight behavior-execution/graph-modification feedback loop. We implement cognitive graphs using Hebbian-learning and a novel harmonic neural representation supporting flexible information storage. We validate our approach through simulation experiments showing rapid achievement of highly-robust navigation ability in complex mazes, as well as high reward on difficult extensions of classic reinforcement learning problems. This framework offers a new theoretical model for developmental learning and paves the way for robots that can autonomously master complex skills and handle exceptional circumstances.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, concerns about their reliability, particularly due to hallucinations - factually inaccurate or irrelevant outputs - have grown. Our research investigates the relationship between the uncertainty in training dynamics and the emergence of hallucinations. Using models from the Pythia suite and several hallucination detection metrics, we analyze hallucination trends and identify significant variance during training. To address this, we propose \textbf{Sensitivity Dropout (SenD)}, a novel training protocol designed to reduce hallucination variance during training by deterministically dropping embedding indices with significant variability. In addition, we develop an unsupervised hallucination detection metric, Efficient EigenScore (EES), which approximates the traditional EigenScore in 2x speed. This metric is integrated into our training protocol, allowing SenD to be both computationally scalable and effective at reducing hallucination variance. SenD improves test-time reliability of Pythia and Meta's Llama models by up to 17\% and enhances factual accuracy in Wikipedia, Medical, Legal, and Coding domains without affecting downstream task performance.

Furthermore, the approach is general and imposes no restrictions on the hidden domain or the number or arity of the predicates. The new learning method is based on an \emph{efficient, novel test} that checks whether the assumption that a predicate is affected by a set of action patterns, namely, actions with specific argument positions, is consistent with the traces. The predicates and action patterns that pass the test provide the basis for the learned domain that is then easily completed with preconditions and static predicates. The new method is studied theoretically and experimentally. For the latter, the method is evaluated on traces and graphs obtained from standard classical domains like the 8-puzzle, which involve hundreds of thousands of states and transitions. The learned representations are then verified on larger instances.

Abstract: User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to a misalignment between the user intent and models' understanding. As a result, users commonly have to painstakingly refine their prompts. We study this alignment problem in text-to-image (T2I) generation and propose a prototype for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their uncertainty about user intent as an understandable and editable belief graph. We build simple prototypes for such agents and propose a new scalable and automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth intent (an image) while the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. We experiment over three image-text datasets: ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), COCO (Lin et al., 2014) and DesignBench, a benchmark we curated with strong artistic and design elements. Experiments over the three datasets demonstrate the proposed T2I agents' ability to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard T2I generation. Moreover, we conducted human studies and observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

<title>Generative Emergent Communication: Large Language Model is a Collective World Model</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to capture extensive world knowledge, yet how this is achieved without direct sensorimotor experience remains a fundamental puzzle. This study proposes a novel theoretical solution by introducing the Collective World Model hypothesis. We argue that an LLM does not learn a world model from scratch; instead, it learns a statistical approximation of a collective world model that is already implicitly encoded in human language through a society-wide process of embodied, interactive sense-making. To formalize this process, we introduce generative emergent communication (Generative EmCom), a framework built on the Collective Predictive Coding (CPC). This framework models the emergence of language as a process of decentralized Bayesian inference over the internal states of multiple agents. We argue that this process effectively creates an encoder-decoder structure at a societal scale: human society collectively encodes its grounded, internal representations into language, and an LLM subsequently decodes these symbols to reconstruct a latent space that mirrors the structure of the original collective representations. This perspective provides a principled, mathematical explanation for how LLMs acquire their capabilities. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) the formalization of the Generative EmCom framework, clarifying its connection to world models and multi-agent reinforcement learning, and 2) its application to interpret LLMs, explaining phenomena such as distributional semantics as a natural consequence of representation reconstruction. This work provides a unified theory that bridges individual cognitive development, collective language evolution, and the foundations of large-scale AI.

Abstract: This paper introduces the System 0/1/2/3 framework as an extension of dual-process theory, employing a quad-process model of cognition. Expanding upon System 1 (fast, intuitive thinking) and System 2 (slow, deliberative thinking), we incorporate System 0, which represents pre-cognitive embodied processes, and System 3, which encompasses collective intelligence and symbol emergence. We contextualize this model within Bergson's philosophy by adopting multi-scale time theory to unify the diverse temporal dynamics of cognition. System 0 emphasizes morphological computation and passive dynamics, illustrating how physical embodiment enables adaptive behavior without explicit neural processing. Systems 1 and 2 are explained from a constructive perspective, incorporating neurodynamical and AI viewpoints. In System 3, we introduce collective predictive coding to explain how societal-level adaptation and symbol emergence operate over extended timescales. This comprehensive framework ranges from rapid embodied reactions to slow-evolving collective intelligence, offering a unified perspective on cognition across multiple timescales, levels of abstraction, and forms of human intelligence. The System 0/1/2/3 model provides a novel theoretical foundation for understanding the interplay between adaptive and cognitive processes, thereby opening new avenues for research in cognitive science, AI, robotics, and collective intelligence.

Abstract: Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process that enables logical inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reasoning has emerged as a key capability that distinguishes advanced AI systems from conventional models that empower chatbots. In this survey, we categorize existing methods along two orthogonal dimensions: (1) Regimes, which define the stage at which reasoning is achieved (either at inference time or through dedicated training); and (2) Architectures, which determine the components involved in the reasoning process, distinguishing between standalone LLMs and agentic compound systems that incorporate external tools, and multi-agent collaborations. Within each dimension, we analyze two key perspectives: (1) Input level, which focuses on techniques that construct high-quality prompts that the LLM condition on; and (2) Output level, which methods that refine multiple sampled candidates to enhance reasoning quality. This categorization provides a systematic understanding of the evolving landscape of LLM reasoning, highlighting emerging trends such as the shift from inference-scaling to learning-to-reason (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and the transition to agentic workflows (e.g., OpenAI Deep Research, Manus Agent). Additionally, we cover a broad spectrum of learning algorithms, from supervised fine-tuning to reinforcement learning such as PPO and GRPO, and the training of reasoners and verifiers. We also examine key designs of agentic workflows, from established patterns like generator-evaluator and LLM debate to recent innovations. ...

Abstract: Despite their many successes, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with tasks that require complex reasoning over large parts of their input. We argue that these failures arise due to capacity limits on the accurate flow of information within LLMs. To formalize this issue, we introduce the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model, a new computational framework that models bandwidth constraints on attention heads, the mechanism for internal communication in LLMs. We show that several important reasoning problems like graph reachability require high communication bandwidth for BAPOs to solve; we call these problems BAPO-hard. Our experiments corroborate our theoretical predictions: GPT-4o, Claude, and Gemini succeed on BAPO-easy tasks and fail even on relatively small BAPO-hard tasks. BAPOs also reveal another benefit of chain of thought (CoT): we prove that breaking down a task using CoT can turn any BAPO-hard problem into a BAPO-easy one. Our results offer principled explanations for key LLM failures and suggest directions for architectures and inference methods that mitigate bandwidth limits.

Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&amp;A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.

<title>Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?</title>

Abstract: Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.

Abstract: We introduce EPIC-SOUNDS, a large-scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos. We propose an annotation pipeline where annotators temporally label distinguishable audio segments and describe the action that could have caused this sound. We identify actions that can be discriminated purely from audio, through grouping these free-form descriptions of audio into classes. For actions that involve objects colliding, we collect human annotations of the materials of these objects (e.g. a glass object being placed on a wooden surface), which we verify from video, discarding ambiguities. Overall, EPIC-SOUNDS includes 78.4k categorised segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes as well as 39.2k non-categorised segments. We train and evaluate state-of-the-art audio recognition and detection models on our dataset, for both audio-only and audio-visual methods. We also conduct analysis on: the temporal overlap between audio events, the temporal and label correlations between audio and visual modalities, the ambiguities in annotating materials from audio-only input, the importance of audio-only labels and the limitations of current models to understand actions that sound.

Abstract: This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.

Abstract: In light of emerging legal requirements and policies focused on privacy protection, there is a growing trend of companies across various industries adopting Federated Learning (FL). This decentralized approach involves multiple clients or silos, collaboratively training a global model under the coordination of a central server while utilizing their private local data. Unlike traditional methods that necessitate data sharing and transmission, Cross-Silo FL allows clients to share model updates rather than raw data, thereby enhancing privacy. Despite its growing adoption, the carbon impact associated with Cross-Silo FL remains poorly understood due to the limited research in this area. This study seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating the sustainability of Cross-Silo FL throughout the entire AI product lifecycle, extending the analysis beyond the model training phase alone. We systematically compare this decentralized method with traditional centralized approaches and present a robust quantitative framework for assessing the costs and CO2 emissions in real-world Cross-Silo FL environments. Our findings indicate that the energy consumption and costs of model training are comparable between Cross-Silo Federated Learning and Centralized Learning. However, the additional data transfer and storage requirements inherent in Centralized Learning can result in significant, often overlooked CO2 emissions. Moreover, we introduce an innovative data and application management system that integrates Cross-Silo FL and analytics, aiming at improving the sustainability and economic efficiency of IT enterprises.

Abstract: Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.

<title>On the Statistical Properties of Generative Adversarial Models for Low Intrinsic Data Dimension</title>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable empirical successes of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the theoretical guarantees for their statistical accuracy remain rather pessimistic. In particular, the data distributions on which GANs are applied, such as natural images, are often hypothesized to have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure in a typically high-dimensional feature space, but this is often not reflected in the derived rates in the state-of-the-art analyses. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice of GANs and their bidirectional variant, Bi-directional GANs (BiGANs), by deriving statistical guarantees on the estimated densities in terms of the intrinsic dimension of the data and the latent space. We analytically show that if one has access to $n$ samples from the unknown target distribution and the network architectures are properly chosen, the expected Wasserstein-1 distance of the estimates from the target scales as $O\left( n^{-1/d_\mu } \right)$ for GANs and $\tilde{O}\left( n^{-1/(d_\mu+\ell)} \right)$ for BiGANs, where $d_\mu$ and $\ell$ are the upper Wasserstein-1 dimension of the data-distribution and latent-space dimension, respectively. The theoretical analyses not only suggest that these methods successfully avoid the curse of dimensionality, in the sense that the exponent of $n$ in the error rates does not depend on the data dimension but also serve to bridge the gap between the theoretical analyses of GANs and the known sharp rates from optimal transport literature. Additionally, we demonstrate that GANs can effectively achieve the minimax optimal rate even for non-smooth underlying distributions, with the use of interpolating generator networks.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents in environments involving human interaction has increasingly raised security concerns. Consequently, understanding the circumstances behind an event becomes critical, requiring the development of capabilities to justify their behaviors to non-expert users. Such explanations are essential in enhancing trustworthiness and safety, acting as a preventive measure against failures, errors, and misunderstandings. Additionally, they contribute to improving communication, bridging the gap between the agent and the user, thereby improving the effectiveness of their interactions. This work presents an accountability and explainability architecture implemented for ROS-based mobile robots. The proposed solution consists of two main components. Firstly, a black box-like element to provide accountability, featuring anti-tampering properties achieved through blockchain technology. Secondly, a component in charge of generating natural language explanations by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) over the data contained within the previously mentioned black box. The study evaluates the performance of our solution in three different scenarios, each involving autonomous agent navigation functionalities. This evaluation includes a thorough examination of accountability and explainability metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in using accountable data from robot actions to obtain coherent, accurate and understandable explanations, even when facing challenges inherent in the use of autonomous agents in real-world scenarios.

Under controlled water tank validation conditions, StreakNet-Arch with Self-Attention or DBC-Attention outperforms traditional bandpass filtering and achieves higher $F_1$ scores than learning-based MP networks and CNNs at comparable model size and complexity. Real-time benchmarks on an NVIDIA RTX 3060 show a constant Average Imaging Time (54 to 84 ms) regardless of frame count, versus a linear increase (58 to 1,257 ms) for conventional methods. To facilitate further research, we contribute a publicly available streak-tube camera image dataset contains 2,695,168 real-world underwater 3D point cloud data. More importantly, we validate our UCLR system in a South China Sea trial, reaching an error of 46mm for 3D target at 1,000 m depth and 20 m range.

Abstract: State-of-the-art link prediction (LP) models demonstrate impressive benchmark results. However, popular benchmark datasets often assume that training, validation, and testing samples are representative of the overall dataset distribution. In real-world situations, this assumption is often incorrect; uncontrolled factors lead new dataset samples to come from a different distribution than training samples. Additionally, the majority of recent work with graph dataset shift focuses on node- and graph-level tasks, largely ignoring link-level tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel splitting strategy, known as LPShift, which utilizes structural properties to induce a controlled distribution shift. We verify LPShift's effect through empirical evaluation of SOTA LP models on 16 LPShift variants of original dataset splits, with results indicating drastic changes to model performance. Additional experiments demonstrate graph structure has a strong influence on the success of current generalization methods. Source Code Available Here: https://github.com/revolins/LPShift

Abstract: Despite their success, Large-Language Models (LLMs) still face criticism due to their lack of interpretability. Traditional post-hoc interpretation methods, based on attention and gradient-based analysis, offer limited insights as they only approximate the model's decision-making processes and have been proved to be unreliable. For this reason, Concept-Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have been lately proposed in the textual field to provide interpretable predictions based on human-understandable concepts. However, CBMs still exhibit several limitations due to their architectural constraints limiting their expressivity, to the absence of task-interpretability when employing non-linear task predictors and for requiring extensive annotations that are impractical for real-world text data. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel Linearly Interpretable Concept Embedding Model (LICEM) going beyond the current accuracy-interpretability trade-off. LICEMs classification accuracy is better than existing interpretable models and matches black-box ones. We show that the explanations provided by our models are more interveneable and causally consistent with respect to existing solutions. Finally, we show that LICEMs can be trained without requiring any concept supervision, as concepts can be automatically predicted when using an LLM backbone.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is a popular benchmark focused on visual reasoning in the evaluation of Artificial Intelligence systems. In its original framing, an ARC task requires solving a program synthesis problem over small 2D images using a few input-output training pairs. In this work, we adopt the recently popular data-driven approach to the ARC and ask whether a Vision Transformer (ViT) can learn the implicit mapping, from input image to output image, that underlies the task. We show that a ViT -- otherwise a state-of-the-art model for images -- fails dramatically on most ARC tasks even when trained on one million examples per task. This points to an inherent representational deficiency of the ViT architecture that makes it incapable of uncovering the simple structured mappings underlying the ARC tasks. Building on these insights, we propose ViTARC, a ViT-style architecture that unlocks some of the visual reasoning capabilities required by the ARC. Specifically, we use a pixel-level input representation, design a spatially-aware tokenization scheme, and introduce a novel object-based positional encoding that leverages automatic segmentation, among other enhancements. Our task-specific ViTARC models achieve a test solve rate close to 100% on more than half of the 400 public ARC tasks strictly through supervised learning from input-output grids. This calls attention to the importance of imbuing the powerful (Vision) Transformer with the correct inductive biases for abstract visual reasoning that are critical even when the training data is plentiful and the mapping is noise-free. Hence, ViTARC provides a strong foundation for future research in visual reasoning using transformer-based architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been widely used to transfer knowledge from large, accurate models (teachers) to smaller, efficient ones (students). Recent methods have explored enforcing consistency by incorporating causal interpretations to distill invariant representations. In this work, we extend this line of research by introducing a dual augmentation strategy to promote invariant feature learning in both teacher and student models. Our approach leverages different augmentations applied to both models during distillation, pushing the student to capture robust, transferable features. This dual augmentation strategy complements invariant causal distillation by ensuring that the learned representations remain stable across a wider range of data variations and transformations. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving competitive results in same-architecture KD.

<title>Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. Consequently, few RL-based trajectory planning methods can achieve performance comparable to that of imitation learning-based methods. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. Evaluated using closed-loop metrics, the results demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperformed the baseline employing the identical policy model structure and achieved competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. The code is available at https://github.com/Zigned/nuplan_zigned.

Abstract: Quality molecular representations are key to foundation model development in bio-medical research. Previous efforts have typically focused on a single representation or molecular view, which may have strengths or weaknesses on a given task. We develop Multi-view Molecular Embedding with Late Fusion (MMELON), an approach that integrates graph, image and text views in a foundation model setting and may be readily extended to additional representations. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules. The multi-view model performs robustly, matching the performance of the highest-ranked single-view. It is validated on over 120 tasks, including molecular solubility, ADME properties, and activity against G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). We identify 33 GPCRs that are related to Alzheimer's disease and employ the multi-view model to select strong binders from a compound screen. Predictions are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.

Abstract: Trustworthiness in neural networks is crucial for their deployment in critical applications, where reliability, confidence, and uncertainty play pivotal roles in decision-making. Traditional performance metrics such as accuracy and precision fail to capture these aspects, particularly in cases where models exhibit overconfidence. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework for quantifying the trustworthiness of neural networks by incorporating subjective logic into the evaluation of Expected Calibration Error (ECE). This method provides a comprehensive measure of trust, disbelief, and uncertainty by clustering predicted probabilities and fusing opinions using appropriate fusion operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, where post-calibration results indicate improved trustworthiness. The proposed framework offers a more interpretable and nuanced assessment of AI models, with potential applications in sensitive domains such as healthcare and autonomous systems.

<title>TextDestroyer: A Training- and Annotation-Free Diffusion Method for Destroying Anomal Text from Images</title>

arXiv:2411.00355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose TextDestroyer, the first training- and annotation-free method for scene text destruction using a pre-trained diffusion model. Existing scene text removal models require complex annotation and retraining, and may leave faint yet recognizable text information, compromising privacy protection and content concealment. TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.

Abstract: Large-scale cell microscopy screens are used in drug discovery and molecular biology research to study the effects of millions of chemical and genetic perturbations on cells. To use these images in downstream analysis, we need models that can map each image into a feature space that represents diverse biological phenotypes consistently, in the sense that perturbations with similar biological effects have similar representations. In this work, we present the largest foundation model for cell microscopy data to date, a new 1.9 billion-parameter ViT-G/8 MAE trained on over 8 billion microscopy image crops. Compared to a previous published ViT-L/8 MAE, our new model achieves a 60% improvement in linear separability of genetic perturbations and obtains the best overall performance on whole-genome biological relationship recall and replicate consistency benchmarks. Beyond scaling, we developed two key methods that improve performance: (1) training on a curated and diverse dataset; and, (2) using biologically motivated linear probing tasks to search across each transformer block for the best candidate representation of whole-genome screens. We find that many self-supervised vision transformers, pretrained on either natural or microscopy images, yield significantly more biologically meaningful representations of microscopy images in their intermediate blocks than in their typically used final blocks. More broadly, our approach and results provide insights toward a general strategy for successfully building foundation models for large-scale biological data.

Abstract: We present Patherea, a unified framework for point-based cell detection and classification that enables the development and fair evaluation of state-of-the-art methods. To support this, we introduce a large-scale dataset that replicates the clinical workflow for Ki-67 proliferation index estimation. Our method directly predicts cell locations and classes without relying on intermediate representations. It incorporates a hybrid Hungarian matching strategy for accurate point assignment and supports flexible backbones and training regimes, including recent pathology foundation models. Patherea achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets - Lizard, BRCA-M2C, and BCData - while highlighting performance saturation on these benchmarks. In contrast, our newly proposed Patherea dataset presents a significantly more challenging benchmark. Additionally, we identify and correct common errors in current evaluation protocols and provide an updated benchmarking utility for standardized assessment. The Patherea dataset and code are publicly available to facilitate further research and fair comparisons.

Abstract: This article addresses theory in evolutionary many-objective optimization and focuses on the role of crossover operators. The advantages of using crossover are hardly understood and rigorous runtime analyses with crossover are lagging far behind its use in practice, specifically in the case of more than two objectives. We present two many-objective problems $RR_{\text{RO}}$ and $uRR_{\text{RO}}$ together with a theoretical runtime analysis of the GSEMO and the widely used NSGA-III algorithm to demonstrate that one point crossover on $RR_{\text{RO}}$, as well as uniform crossover on $uRR_{\text{RO}}$, can yield an exponential speedup in the runtime. In particular, when the number of objectives is constant, this algorithms can find the Pareto set of both problems in expected polynomial time when using crossover while without crossover they require exponential time to even find a single Pareto-optimal point. For both problems, we also demonstrate a significant performance gap in certain superconstant parameter regimes for the number of objectives. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first rigorous runtime analysis in many-objective optimization which demonstrates an exponential performance gap when using crossover for more than two objectives. Additionally, it is the first runtime analysis involving crossover in many-objective optimization where the number of objectives is not necessarily constant.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have expanded their application across various domains, including chip design, where domain-adapted chip models like ChipNeMo have emerged. However, these models often struggle with instruction alignment, a crucial capability for LLMs that involves following explicit human directives. This limitation impedes the practical application of chip LLMs, including serving as assistant chatbots for hardware design engineers. In this work, we introduce ChipAlign, a novel approach that utilizes a training-free model merging strategy, combining the strengths of a general instruction-aligned LLM with a chip-specific LLM. By considering the underlying manifold in the weight space, ChipAlign employs geodesic interpolation to effectively fuse the weights of input LLMs, producing a merged model that inherits strong instruction alignment and chip expertise from the respective instruction and chip LLMs. Our results demonstrate that ChipAlign significantly enhances instruction-following capabilities of existing chip LLMs, achieving up to a 26.6% improvement on the IFEval benchmark, while maintaining comparable expertise in the chip domain. This improvement in instruction alignment also translates to notable gains in instruction-involved QA tasks, delivering performance enhancements of 3.9% on the OpenROAD QA benchmark and 8.25% on production-level chip QA benchmarks, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Formalized mathematics has recently garnered significant attention for its ability to assist mathematicians across various fields. Premise retrieval, as a common step in mathematical formalization, has been a challenge, particularly for inexperienced users. Existing retrieval methods that facilitate natural language queries require a certain level of mathematical expertise from users, while approaches based on formal languages (e.g., Lean) typically struggle with the scarcity of training data, hindering the training of effective and generalizable retrieval models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages data extracted from Mathlib to train a lightweight and effective premise retrieval model. In particular, the proposed model embeds queries (i.e., proof state provided by Lean) and premises in a latent space, featuring a tokenizer specifically trained on formal corpora. The model is learned in a contrastive learning framework, in which a fine-grained similarity calculation method and a re-ranking module are applied to enhance the retrieval performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining a lower computational load. We have released an open-source search engine based on our retrieval model at https://premise-search.com/. The source code and the trained model can be found at https://github.com/ruc-ai4math/Premise-Retrieval.

Abstract: Metadata management plays a critical role in data governance, resource discovery, and decision-making in the data-driven era. While traditional metadata approaches have primarily focused on organization, classification, and resource reuse, the integration of modern artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has significantly transformed these processes. This paper investigates both traditional and AI-driven metadata approaches by examining open-source solutions, commercial tools, and research initiatives. A comparative analysis of traditional and AI-driven metadata management methods is provided, highlighting existing challenges and their impact on next-generation datasets. The paper also presents an innovative AI-assisted metadata management framework designed to address these challenges. This framework leverages more advanced modern AI technologies to automate metadata generation, enhance governance, and improve the accessibility and usability of modern datasets. Finally, the paper outlines future directions for research and development, proposing opportunities to further advance metadata management in the context of AI-driven innovation and complex datasets.

<title>PATCH: a deep learning method to assess heterogeneity of artistic practice in historical paintings</title>

arXiv:2502.01912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The history of art has seen significant shifts in the manner in which artworks are created, making understanding of creative processes a central question in technical art history. In the Renaissance and Early Modern period, paintings were largely produced by master painters directing workshops of apprentices who often contributed to projects. The masters varied significantly in artistic and managerial styles, meaning different combinations of artists and implements might be seen both between masters and within workshops or even individual canvases. Information on how different workshops were managed and the processes by which artworks were created remains elusive. Machine learning methods have potential to unearth new information about artists' creative processes by extending the analysis of brushwork to a microscopic scale. Analysis of workshop paintings, however, presents a challenge in that documentation of the artists and materials involved is sparse, meaning external examples are not available to train networks to recognize their contributions. Here we present a novel machine learning approach we call pairwise assignment training for classifying heterogeneity (PATCH) that is capable of identifying individual artistic practice regimes with no external training data, or "ground truth." The method achieves unsupervised results by supervised means, and outperforms both simple statistical procedures and unsupervised machine learning methods. We apply this method to two historical paintings by the Spanish Renaissance master, El Greco: The Baptism of Christ and Christ on the Cross with Landscape, and our findings regarding the former potentially challenge previous work that has assigned the painting to workshop members. Further, the results of our analyses create a measure of heterogeneity of artistic practice that can be used to characterize artworks across time and space.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are often asked to generate structured outputs that obey precise syntactic rules, such as code snippets or formatted data. Grammar-constrained decoding (GCD) can guarantee that LLM outputs matches such rules by masking out tokens that will provably lead to outputs that do not belong to a specified context-free grammar (CFG). To guarantee soundness, GCD algorithms have to compute how a given LLM subword tokenizer can align with the tokens used
  by a given context-free grammar and compute token masks based on this information. Doing so efficiently is challenging and existing GCD algorithms require tens of minutes to preprocess common grammars. We present a new GCD algorithm together with an implementation that offers 17.71x faster offline preprocessing than existing approaches while preserving state-of-the-art efficiency in online mask computation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is now widely adopted as the final stage of large language model training, especially for reasoning-style tasks such as maths problems. Typically, models attempt each question many times during a single training step and attempt to learn from their successes and failures. However, we demonstrate that throughout training with two popular algorithms (PPO and VinePPO) on two widely used datasets, many questions are either solved by all attempts - meaning they are already learned - or by none - providing no meaningful training signal. To address this, we adapt a method from the reinforcement learning literature - sampling for learnability - and apply it to the reinforcement learning stage of LLM training. Our curriculum prioritises questions with high variance of success, i.e. those where the agent sometimes succeeds, but not always. Our findings demonstrate that this curriculum consistently boosts training performance across multiple algorithms and datasets, paving the way for more efficient and effective reinforcement learning with LLMs.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated gaps in diverse cultural awareness across the globe. We investigate the effect of retrieval augmented generation and search-grounding techniques on LLMs' ability to display familiarity with various national cultures. Specifically, we compare the performance of standard LLMs, LLMs augmented with retrievals from a bespoke knowledge base (i.e., KB grounding), and LLMs augmented with retrievals from a web search (i.e., search grounding) on multiple cultural awareness benchmarks. We find that search grounding significantly improves the LLM performance on multiple-choice benchmarks that test propositional knowledge (e.g., cultural norms, artifacts, and institutions), while KB grounding's effectiveness is limited by inadequate knowledge base coverage and a suboptimal retriever. However, search grounding also increases the risk of stereotypical judgments by language models and fails to improve evaluators' judgments of cultural familiarity in a human evaluation with adequate statistical power. These results highlight the distinction between propositional cultural knowledge and open-ended cultural fluency when it comes to evaluating LLMs' cultural awareness.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a crucial task in computer vision aimed at enhancing the visual fidelity of images captured under low-illumination conditions. Conventional methods frequently struggle with noise, overexposure, and color distortion, leading to significant image quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose LUMINA-Net, an unsupervised deep learning framework that learns adaptive priors from low-light image pairs by integrating multi-stage illumination and reflectance modules. To assist the Retinex decomposition, inappropriate features in the raw image can be removed using a simple self-supervised mechanism. First, the illumination module intelligently adjusts brightness and contrast while preserving intricate textural details. Second, the reflectance module incorporates a noise reduction mechanism that leverages spatial attention and channel-wise feature refinement to mitigate noise contamination. Through extensive experiments on LOL and SICE datasets, evaluated using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, LUMINA-Net surpasses state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its efficacy in low-light image enhancement.

Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently gained attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in complex scenes due to distortions in non-personalized regions and the need for additional fine-tuning, limiting their practicality. To address this issue, we propose FlipConcept, a novel approach that seamlessly integrates multiple personalized concepts into a single image without requiring additional tuning. We introduce guided appearance attention to enhance the visual fidelity of personalized concepts. Additionally, we introduce mask-guided noise mixing to protect non-personalized regions during concept integration. Lastly, we apply background dilution to minimize concept leakage, i.e., the undesired blending of personalized concepts with other objects in the image. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method, despite not requiring tuning, outperforms existing models in both single and multiple personalized concept inference. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach for scalable, high-quality multi-concept personalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have highlighted the potential of automating interpretability pipelines in analyzing the latent representations within LLMs. While this may enhance our understanding of internal mechanisms, the field lacks standardized evaluation methods for assessing the validity of discovered features. We attempt to bridge this gap by introducing FADE: Feature Alignment to Description Evaluation, a scalable model-agnostic framework for automatically evaluating feature-to-description alignment. FADE evaluates alignment across four key metrics - Clarity, Responsiveness, Purity, and Faithfulness - and systematically quantifies the causes of the misalignment between features and their descriptions. We apply FADE to analyze existing open-source feature descriptions and assess key components of automated interpretability pipelines, aiming to enhance the quality of descriptions. Our findings highlight fundamental challenges in generating feature descriptions, particularly for SAEs compared to MLP neurons, providing insights into the limitations and future directions of automated interpretability. We release FADE as an open-source package at: https://github.com/brunibrun/FADE

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural activity is essential for understanding the human brain. While fMRI methods have successfully reconstructed static images, fMRI-to-video reconstruction faces challenges due to the need for capturing spatiotemporal dynamics like motion and scene transitions. Recent approaches have improved semantic and perceptual alignment but struggle to integrate coarse fMRI data with detailed visual features. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of the visual system, we propose NEURONS, a novel framework that decouples learning into four correlated sub-tasks: key object segmentation, concept recognition, scene description, and blurry video reconstruction. This approach simulates the visual cortex's functional specialization, allowing the model to capture diverse video content. In the inference stage, NEURONS generates robust conditioning signals for a pre-trained text-to-video diffusion model to reconstruct the videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NEURONS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving solid improvements in video consistency (26.6%) and semantic-level accuracy (19.1%). Notably, NEURONS shows a strong functional correlation with the visual cortex, highlighting its potential for brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications. Code and model weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/NEURONS.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at various image-related tasks, they encounter challenges in precisely aligning coordinates with spatial information within images, particularly in position-aware tasks such as visual grounding. This limitation arises from two key factors. First, MLLMs lack explicit spatial references, making it difficult to associate textual descriptions with precise image locations. Second, their feature extraction processes prioritize global context over fine-grained spatial details, leading to weak localization capability. To address these issues, we introduce VPP-LLaVA, an MLLM enhanced with Visual Position Prompt (VPP) to improve its grounding capability. VPP-LLaVA integrates two complementary mechanisms: the global VPP overlays a learnable, axis-like tensor onto the input image to provide structured spatial cues, while the local VPP incorporates position-aware queries to support fine-grained localization.To effectively train our model with spatial guidance, we further introduce VPP-SFT, a curated dataset of 0.6M high-quality visual grounding samples. Designed in a compact format, it enables efficient training and is significantly smaller than datasets used by other MLLMs (e.g., ~21M samples in MiniGPT-v2), yet still provides a strong performance boost. The resulting model, VPP-LLaVA, not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard visual grounding benchmarks but also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to challenging unseen datasets. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/WayneTomas/VPP-LLaVA.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative machine learning (ML) model training among decentralized clients' information, ensuring data privacy. The decentralized nature of FL deals with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This open problem has notable consequences, such as decreased model performance and more significant convergence times. Despite its importance, experimental studies systematically addressing all types of data heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IIDness) remain scarce. We aim to fill this gap by assessing and quantifying the non-IID effect through a thorough empirical analysis. We use the Hellinger Distance (HD) to measure differences in distribution among clients. Our study benchmarks four state-of-the-art strategies for handling non-IID data, including label, feature, quantity, and spatiotemporal skewness, under realistic and controlled conditions. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal skew effect in FL. Our findings highlight the significant impact of label and spatiotemporal skew non-IID types on FL model performance, with notable performance drops occurring at specific HD thresholds. Additionally, the FL performance is heavily affected mainly when the non-IIDness is extreme. Thus, we provide recommendations for FL research to tackle data heterogeneity effectively. Our work represents the most extensive examination of non-IIDness in FL, offering a robust foundation for future research.

Abstract: Several recent works have argued that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to tame the data deluge in the cybersecurity field, by improving the automation of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tasks. This work presents an evaluation methodology that other than allowing to test LLMs on CTI tasks when using zero-shot learning, few-shot learning and fine-tuning, also allows to quantify their consistency and their confidence level. We run experiments with three state-of-the-art LLMs and a dataset of 350 threat intelligence reports and present new evidence of potential security risks in relying on LLMs for CTI. We show how LLMs cannot guarantee sufficient performance on real-size reports while also being inconsistent and overconfident. Few-shot learning and fine-tuning only partially improve the results, thus posing doubts about the possibility of using LLMs for CTI scenarios, where labelled datasets are lacking and where confidence is a fundamental factor.

Abstract: AI systems are gaining widespread adoption across various sectors and domains. Creating high-quality AI system requirements is crucial for aligning the AI system with business goals and consumer values and for social responsibility. However, with the uncertain nature of AI systems and the heavy reliance on sensitive data, more research is needed to address the elicitation and analysis of AI systems requirements. With the proprietary nature of many AI systems, there is a lack of open-source requirements artifacts and technical requirements documents for AI systems, limiting broader research and investigation. With Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as a promising alternative to human-generated text, this paper investigates the potential use of LLMs to generate user stories for AI systems based on abstracts from scholarly papers. We conducted an empirical evaluation using three LLMs and generated $1260$ user stories from $42$ abstracts from $26$ domains. We assess their quality using the Quality User Story (QUS) framework. Moreover, we identify relevant non-functional requirements (NFRs) and ethical principles. Our analysis demonstrates that the investigated LLMs can generate user stories inspired by the needs of various stakeholders, offering a promising approach for generating user stories for research purposes and for aiding in the early requirements elicitation phase of AI systems. We have compiled and curated a collection of stories generated by various LLMs into a dataset (UStAI), which is now publicly available for use.

<title>Semantic Adapter for Universal Text Embeddings: Diagnosing and Mitigating Negation Blindness to Enhance Universality</title>

Abstract: Negation plays an important role in various natural language processing tasks such as Natural Language Inference and Sentiment Analysis tasks. Numerous prior studies have found that contextual text embedding models such as BERT, ELMO, RoBERTa or XLNet face challenges in accurately understanding negation. Recent advancements in universal text embeddings have demonstrated superior performance over contextual text embeddings in various tasks. However, due to the bias in popular evaluation benchmarks, the negation awareness capacity of these models remains unclear. To bridge the gap in existing literature, an in-depth analysis is initiated in this work to study the negation awareness of cutting-edge universal text embedding models. Our findings reveal a significant lack of negation awareness in these models, often interpreting negated text pairs as semantically similar. To efficiently deal with the conflict that different tasks need different trade-offs between topic and negation information among other semantic information, a data-efficient and computational-efficient embedding re-weighting method is proposed without modifying the parameters of text embedding models. The proposed solution is able to improve text embedding models' negation awareness significantly on both simple negation understanding task and complex negation understanding task. Furthermore, the proposed solution can also significantly improve the negation awareness of Large Language Model based task-specific high dimensional universal text embeddings.

Abstract: Generative agents offer promising capabilities for simulating realistic urban behaviors. However, existing methods oversimplify transportation choices, rely heavily on static agent profiles leading to behavioral homogenization, and inherit prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we present MobileCity, a lightweight simulation platform designed to model realistic urban mobility with high computational efficiency. We introduce a comprehensive transportation system with multiple transport modes, and collect questionnaire data from respondents to construct agent profiles. To enable scalable simulation, agents perform action selection within a pre-generated action space and uses local models for efficient agent memory generation. Through extensive micro and macro-level evaluations on 4,000 agents, we demonstrate that MobileCity generates more realistic urban behaviors than baselines while maintaining computational efficiency. We further explore practical applications such as predicting movement patterns and analyzing demographic trends in transportation preferences.

<title>TD-EVAL: Revisiting Task-Oriented Dialogue Evaluation by Combining Turn-Level Precision with Dialogue-Level Comparisons</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19982</link>

arXiv:2504.19982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems are experiencing a revolution driven by Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the evaluation methodologies for these systems remain insufficient for their growing sophistication. While traditional automatic metrics effectively assessed earlier modular systems, they focus solely on the dialogue level and cannot detect critical intermediate errors that can arise during user-agent interactions. In this paper, we introduce TD-EVAL (Turn and Dialogue-level Evaluation), a two-step evaluation framework that unifies fine-grained turn-level analysis with holistic dialogue-level comparisons. At turn level, we evaluate each response along three TOD-specific dimensions: conversation cohesion, backend knowledge consistency, and policy compliance. Meanwhile, we design TOD Agent Arena that uses pairwise comparisons to provide a measure of dialogue-level quality. Through experiments on MultiWOZ 2.4 and {\tau}-Bench, we demonstrate that TD-EVAL effectively identifies the conversational errors that conventional metrics miss. Furthermore, TD-EVAL exhibits better alignment with human judgments than traditional and LLM-based metrics. These findings demonstrate that TD-EVAL introduces a new paradigm for TOD system evaluation, efficiently assessing both turn and system levels with a plug-and-play framework for future research.

<title>What's Pulling the Strings? Evaluating Integrity and Attribution in AI Training and Inference through Concept Shift</title>

arXiv:2504.21042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has amplified concerns about trustworthiness, including integrity, privacy, robustness, and bias. To assess and attribute these threats, we propose ConceptLens, a generic framework that leverages pre-trained multimodal models to identify the root causes of integrity threats by analyzing Concept Shift in probing samples. ConceptLens demonstrates strong detection performance for vanilla data poisoning attacks and uncovers vulnerabilities to bias injection, such as the generation of covert advertisements through malicious concept shifts. It identifies privacy risks in unaltered but high-risk samples, filters them before training, and provides insights into model weaknesses arising from incomplete or imbalanced training data. Additionally, at the model level, it attributes concepts that the target model is overly dependent on, identifies misleading concepts, and explains how disrupting key concepts negatively impacts the model. Furthermore, it uncovers sociological biases in generative content, revealing disparities across sociological contexts. Strikingly, ConceptLens reveals how safe training and inference data can be unintentionally and easily exploited, potentially undermining safety alignment. Our study informs actionable insights to breed trust in AI systems, thereby speeding adoption and driving greater innovation.

<title>On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles</title>

arXiv:2505.02274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.

<title>Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.05470v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.

Abstract: Text-to-audio models have recently emerged as a powerful technology for generating sound from textual descriptions. However, their high computational demands raise concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. In this paper, we conduct an analysis of the energy usage of 7 state-of-the-art text-to-audio diffusion-based generative models, evaluating to what extent variations in generation parameters affect energy consumption at inference time. We also aim to identify an optimal balance between audio quality and energy consumption by considering Pareto-optimal solutions across all selected models. Our findings provide insights into the trade-offs between performance and environmental impact, contributing to the development of more efficient generative audio models.

<title>How Hungry is AI? Benchmarking Energy, Water, and Carbon Footprint of LLM Inference</title>

arXiv:2505.09598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel infrastructure-aware benchmarking framework for quantifying the environmental footprint of LLM inference across 30 state-of-the-art models as deployed in commercial data centers. Our framework combines public API performance data with region-specific environmental multipliers and statistical inference of hardware configurations. We additionally utilize cross-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to rank models by performance relative to environmental cost. Our results show that o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerge as the most energy-intensive models, consuming over 33 Wh per long prompt, more than 70 times the consumption of GPT-4.1 nano, and that Claude-3.7 Sonnet ranks highest in eco-efficiency. While a single short GPT-4o query consumes 0.42 Wh, scaling this to 700 million queries/day results in substantial annual environmental impacts. These include electricity use comparable to 35,000 U.S. homes, freshwater evaporation matching the annual drinking needs of 1.2 million people, and carbon emissions requiring a Chicago-sized forest to offset. These findings illustrate a growing paradox: Although AI is becoming cheaper and faster, its global adoption drives disproportionate resource consumption. Our study provides a standardized, empirically grounded methodology for benchmarking the sustainability of LLM deployments, laying a foundation for future environmental accountability in AI development and sustainability standards.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly becoming better autonomous programmers, raising the prospect that they could also automate dangerous offensive cyber-operations. Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.

<title>Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated</title>

Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of $0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman, level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future models.

<title>AKReF: An argumentative knowledge representation framework for structured argumentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). The proposed argumentative knowledge representation framework (AKReF) extends the theoretical foundation and enables the AKG to provide a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand. Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we apply modus ponens on premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes capturing key argumentative features such as the type of premise (e.g., axiom, ordinary premise, assumption), the type of inference rule (e.g., strict, defeasible), preference order over defeasible rules, markers (e.g., "therefore", "however"), and the type of attack (e.g., undercut, rebuttal, undermining). We identify inference rules by locating a specific set of markers, called inference markers (IM). This, in turn, makes it possible to identify undercut attacks previously undetectable in existing datasets. AKG prepares the ground for reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is essential to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, helps reasoning models learn the implicit, indirect relations that require inference over arguments and their interconnections. We use an essay from the AAEC dataset to illustrate the framework. We further show its application in complex analyses such as extracting a conflict-free set and a maximal set of admissible arguments.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

arXiv:2506.05566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled near-human performance on software coding benchmarks, but their effectiveness in RTL code generation remains limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. While prior efforts have fine-tuned LLMs for RTL tasks, they do not fundamentally overcome the data bottleneck and lack support for test-time scaling due to their non-reasoning nature. In this work, we introduce ScaleRTL, the first reasoning LLM for RTL coding that scales up both high-quality reasoning data and test-time compute. Specifically, we curate a diverse set of long chain-of-thought reasoning traces averaging 56K tokens each, resulting in a dataset of 3.5B tokens that captures rich RTL knowledge. Fine-tuning a general-purpose reasoning model on this corpus yields ScaleRTL that is capable of deep RTL reasoning. Subsequently, we further enhance the performance of ScaleRTL through a novel test-time scaling strategy that extends the reasoning process via iteratively reflecting on and self-correcting previous reasoning steps. Experimental results show that ScaleRTL achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, outperforming 18 competitive baselines by up to 18.4% on VerilogEval and 12.7% on RTLLM.

arXiv:2506.06852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery is crucial for Earth observation applications, but remains constrained by limited labelled training data. While self-supervised pretraining methods like Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown promise, they focus on reconstruction rather than localisation-a fundamental aspect of segmentation tasks. We propose adapting LOCA (Location-aware), a position prediction self-supervised learning method, for multimodal satellite imagery semantic segmentation. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of satellite data by extending SatMAE's channel grouping from multispectral to multimodal data, enabling effective handling of multiple modalities, and introducing same-group attention masking to encourage cross-modal interaction during pretraining. The method uses relative patch position prediction, encouraging spatial reasoning for localisation rather than reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on the Sen1Floods11 flood mapping dataset, where it significantly outperforms existing reconstruction-based self-supervised learning methods for satellite imagery. Our results demonstrate that position prediction tasks, when properly adapted for multimodal satellite imagery, learn representations more effective for satellite image semantic segmentation than reconstruction-based approaches.

arXiv:2506.10972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is prohibitively expensive, creating a critical scaling gap where insights from small-scale experiments often fail to transfer to resource-intensive production systems, thereby hindering efficient innovation. To bridge this, we introduce Farseer, a novel and refined scaling law offering enhanced predictive accuracy across scales. By systematically constructing a model loss surface $L(N,D)$, Farseer achieves a significantly better fit to empirical data than prior laws (e.g., Chinchilla's law). Our methodology yields accurate, robust, and highly generalizable predictions, demonstrating excellent extrapolation capabilities, improving upon Chinchilla's law by reducing extrapolation error by 433\%. This allows for the reliable evaluation of competing training strategies across all $(N,D)$ settings, enabling conclusions from small-scale ablation studies to be confidently extrapolated to predict large-scale performance. Furthermore, Farseer provides new insights into optimal compute allocation, better reflecting the nuanced demands of modern LLM training. To validate our approach, we trained an extensive suite of approximately 1,000 LLMs across diverse scales and configurations, consuming roughly 3 million NVIDIA H100 GPU hours. We are comprehensively open-sourcing all models, data, results, and logs at https://github.com/Farseer-Scaling-Law/Farseer to foster further research.

Abstract: Federated learning(FL) is used for distributed scenarios to train artificial intelligence(AI) models while ensuring users' privacy. In federated learning scenario, the server generally never knows about users' data. This type of concept makes the AI training process efficient in terms of data privacy. However, regarding model performance, federated AI models may not sufficiently satisfy AI users' expectations. Furthermore, AI users have a wide range of different needs. It is not easy to satisfy the whole users needs. These types of issues can be addressed through AI model optimization, fine-tuning, or personalization to achieve optimal model performance. To address model optimization challenges, we propose reference model-based federated learning for optimal fine-tuning, which overcomes catastrophic forgetting in each round. This method is derived from Bayesian parameter-efficient transfer learning, which includes an optimal proximal term and utilizes a reference model that incorporates previous model parameters. As a result, this method achieves both high model performance and clients' low computing cost.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains, traditional data privacy measures prove inadequate for protecting information that is implicit, contextual, or inferable - what we define as semantic privacy. This Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) introduces a lifecycle-centric framework to analyze how semantic privacy risks emerge across input processing, pretraining, fine-tuning, and alignment stages of LLMs. We categorize key attack vectors and assess how current defenses, such as differential privacy, embedding encryption, edge computing, and unlearning, address these threats. Our analysis reveals critical gaps in semantic-level protection, especially against contextual inference and latent representation leakage. We conclude by outlining open challenges, including quantifying semantic leakage, protecting multimodal inputs, balancing de-identification with generation quality, and ensuring transparency in privacy enforcement. This work aims to inform future research on designing robust, semantically aware privacy-preserving techniques for LLMs.

Abstract: The (generative) artificial intelligence (AI) era has profoundly reshaped the meaning and value of data. No longer confined to static content, data now permeates every stage of the AI lifecycle from the training samples that shape model parameters to the prompts and outputs that drive real-world model deployment. This shift renders traditional notions of data protection insufficient, while the boundaries of what needs safeguarding remain poorly defined. Failing to safeguard data in AI systems can inflict societal and individual, underscoring the urgent need to clearly delineate the scope of and rigorously enforce data protection. In this perspective, we propose a four-level taxonomy, including non-usability, privacy preservation, traceability, and deletability, that captures the diverse protection needs arising in modern (generative) AI models and systems. Our framework offers a structured understanding of the trade-offs between data utility and control, spanning the entire AI pipeline, including training datasets, model weights, system prompts, and AI-generated content. We analyze representative technical approaches at each level and reveal regulatory blind spots that leave critical assets exposed. By offering a structured lens to align future AI technologies and governance with trustworthy data practices, we underscore the urgency of rethinking data protection for modern AI techniques and provide timely guidance for developers, researchers, and regulators alike.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the task specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the original base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to creation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or fine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning, each job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in excessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular inference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow independent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They cannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and fine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to expose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we address the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model. The base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning processes. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of client-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering them flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method, to achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and works out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library. Our evaluation on Llama2-13B shows the compared to baseline, Symbiosis can fine-tune 4X more adapters on the same set of GPUs in the same amount of time.

Abstract: We investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decomposition-LSTM (DLSTM) networks, combined with an ensemble algorithm, to predict solar flare occurrences using time-series data from the GOES catalog. The dataset spans from 2003 to 2023 and includes 151,071 flare events. Among approximately possible patterns, 7,552 yearly pattern windows are identified, highlighting the challenge of long-term forecasting due to the Sun's complex, self-organized criticality-driven behavior. A sliding window technique is employed to detect temporal quasi-patterns in both irregular and regularized flare time series. Regularization reduces complexity, enhances large flare activity, and captures active days more effectively. To address class imbalance, resampling methods are applied. LSTM and DLSTM models are trained on sequences of peak fluxes and waiting times from irregular time series, while LSTM and DLSTM, integrated with an ensemble approach, are applied to sliding windows of regularized time series with a 3-hour interval. Performance metrics, particularly TSS (0.74), recall (0.95) and the area under the curve (AUC=0.87) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC), indicate that DLSTM with an ensemble approach on regularized time series outperforms other models, offering more accurate large-flare forecasts with fewer false errors compared to models trained on irregular time series. The superior performance of DLSTM is attributed to its ability to decompose time series into trend and seasonal components, effectively isolating random noise. This study underscores the potential of advanced machine learning techniques for solar flare prediction and highlights the importance of incorporating various solar cycle phases and resampling strategies to enhance forecasting reliability.

Summary: 
This paper proposes a strategy to accelerate the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by leveraging domain and expert knowledge. The approach involves automated generation of dynamical system computational models from relevant documents and a specific input document. Using SysML diagrams, information about component dependencies, attributes, and operations is extracted accurately. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are utilized in various tasks to enhance the generation of SysML diagrams. Case studies demonstrate the applicability of the automated SysML diagram generation process.

Abstract: This paper contributes to speeding up the design and deployment of engineering dynamical systems by proposing a strategy for exploiting domain and expert knowledge for the automated generation of dynamical system computational model starting from a corpus of document relevant to the dynamical system of interest and an input document describing the specific system. This strategy is implemented in five steps and, crucially, it uses system modeling language diagrams (SysML) to extract accurate information about the dependencies, attributes, and operations of components. Natural Language Processing (NLP) strategies and Large Language Models (LLMs) are employed in specific tasks to improve intermediate outputs of the SySML diagrams automated generation, such as: list of key nouns; list of extracted relationships; list of key phrases and key relationships; block attribute values; block relationships; and BDD diagram generation. The applicability of automated SysML diagram generation is illustrated with different case studies. The computational models of complex dynamical systems from SysML diagrams are then obtained via code generation and computational model generation steps. In the code generation step, NLP strategies are used for summarization, while LLMs are used for validation only. The proposed approach is not limited to a specific system, domain, or computational software. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown via an end-to-end example from text to model of a simple pendulum, showing improved performance compared to results yielded by LLMs only.

Abstract: Current AI agent architectures suffer from ephemeral memory limitations, preventing effective collaboration and knowledge sharing across sessions and agent boundaries. We introduce SAMEP (Secure Agent Memory Exchange Protocol), a novel framework that enables persistent, secure, and semantically searchable memory sharing among AI agents. Our protocol addresses three critical challenges: (1) persistent context preservation across agent sessions, (2) secure multi-agent collaboration with fine-grained access control, and (3) efficient semantic discovery of relevant historical context. SAMEP implements a distributed memory repository with vector-based semantic search, cryptographic access controls (AES-256-GCM), and standardized APIs compatible with existing agent communication protocols (MCP, A2A). We demonstrate SAMEP's effectiveness across diverse domains including multi-agent software development, healthcare AI with HIPAA compliance, and multi-modal processing pipelines. Experimental results show 73% reduction in redundant computations, 89% improvement in context relevance scores, and complete compliance with regulatory requirements including audit trail generation. SAMEP enables a new paradigm of persistent, collaborative AI agent ecosystems while maintaining security and privacy guarantees.

<div> Keywords: Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Emergent Communication, Neural Representations, Symbolic Communication, Nash equilibrium

Summary:
The study challenges the use of artificial inductive biases in achieving Emergent Communication in Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Through experiments with the AIM framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), it is shown that agents can naturally develop symbolic communication without external biases. The neural representations exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence. This aligns with neuroscience findings suggesting that human language may not be directly used for internal thought. The AIM framework demonstrates greater generality and efficiency compared to traditional methods. The power-law distribution of symbol usage leads to three key theoretical insights: the "Neural Communication Hypothesis," the "Tool-First Principle," and the "Semantic Interpretability Paradigm." Future research will explore enhancing AIM's capabilities with Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) and investigate RL Low-Level Pre-training, offering new possibilities for combining symbolism and connectionism. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development of Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration Dilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' . Traditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate communication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such artificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments with the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an endogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit spontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic convergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external inductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that the human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and resonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM demonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis toolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a significant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical insights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First Principle'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research will explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders (HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the potential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''. This discovery offers new avenues for bridging symbolism and connectionism.

<div> Keywords: Multi-agent architectures, Visual and language understanding, Trust, Zero-shot settings, Modular framework

Summary:<br />
Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilizing multi-agent architectures that combine visual and language understanding. However, a significant challenge lies in trusting these agents, particularly in zero-shot scenarios without fine-tuning. This study introduces a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that incorporates generalist multimodal agents, a non-visual reasoning orchestrator, and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Through benchmarking on apple leaf disease diagnosis, three configurations were tested, including zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, fine-tuned agents, and trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval. The results revealed a 77.94% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting with trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving an overall accuracy of 85.63%. The system's design separates perception from meta-reasoning, enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI, which can be applied to various trust-critical domains. The software source code and components are openly released to promote reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking on Github.

Abstract: Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly relies on multi-agent architectures that blend visual and language understanding. Yet, a pressing challenge remains: How can we trust these agents especially in zero-shot settings with no fine-tuning? We introduce a novel modular Agentic AI visual classification framework that integrates generalist multimodal agents with a non-visual reasoning orchestrator and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module. Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three configurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II) fine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated orchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops. Using confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator modulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\% accuracy improvement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG, achieving 85.63\% overall. GPT-4o showed better calibration, while Qwen-2.5-VL displayed overconfidence. Furthermore, image-RAG grounded predictions with visually similar cases, enabling correction of agent overconfidence via iterative re-evaluation. The proposed system separates perception (vision agents) from meta-reasoning (orchestrator), enabling scalable and interpretable multi-agent AI. This blueprint is extensible to diagnostics, biology, and other trust-critical domains. All models, prompts, results, and system components including the complete software source code are openly released to support reproducibility, transparency, and community benchmarking at Github: https://github.com/Applied-AI-Research-Lab/Orchestrator-Agent-Trust

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, computational split-brain syndrome, symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, logical consistency

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in surface fluency but struggle with tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. The authors diagnose this as a computational split-brain syndrome, where LLMs can articulate correct principles but struggle to apply them consistently due to dissociated instruction and action pathways. This limitation is seen across domains, explaining why model behavior remains brittle even with ideal prompts. LLMs are skilled at pattern completion but lack the architectural framework for compositional reasoning. The findings suggest the need for future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. Mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles. The separation between instruction and execution pathways in LLMs also points to limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display striking surface fluency yet systematically fail at tasks requiring symbolic reasoning, arithmetic accuracy, and logical consistency. This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such failures, revealing a persistent gap between \textit{comprehension} and \textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably applying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational execution. We term this phenomenon the computational \textit{split-brain syndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and functionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from mathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model behavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting. We argue that LLMs function as powerful pattern completion engines, but lack the architectural scaffolding for principled, compositional reasoning. Our findings delineate the boundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with metacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution. This diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may reflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal computational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction and execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and mechanistic analysis.

Summary:
KG2data introduces a system that combines knowledge graphs, large language models, ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies for intelligent data acquisition and query handling in meteorology. The system uses a virtual API to evaluate API call accuracy, outperforming existing models in metrics like name recognition failure and call correctness. KG2data overcomes the limitations of LLM-based systems by utilizing a knowledge graph for domain-specific knowledge access, improving content retrieval, query handling, reasoning, relationship resolution, and data integration. Additionally, the system mitigates the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs, making it adaptable to evolving domain knowledge and API structures. KG2data offers a novel solution for intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in knowledge-intensive domains.

Abstract: API calls by large language models (LLMs) offer a cutting-edge approach for data analysis. However, their ability to effectively utilize tools via API calls remains underexplored in knowledge-intensive domains like meteorology. This paper introduces KG2data, a system that integrates knowledge graphs, LLMs, ReAct agents, and tool-use technologies to enable intelligent data acquisition and query handling in the meteorological field. Using a virtual API, we evaluate API call accuracy across three metrics: name recognition failure, hallucination failure, and call correctness. KG2data achieves superior performance (1.43%, 0%, 88.57%) compared to RAG2data (16%, 10%, 72.14%) and chat2data (7.14%, 8.57%, 71.43%). KG2data differs from typical LLM-based systems by addressing their limited access to domain-specific knowledge, which hampers performance on complex or terminology-rich queries. By using a knowledge graph as persistent memory, our system enhances content retrieval, complex query handling, domain-specific reasoning, semantic relationship resolution, and heterogeneous data integration. It also mitigates the high cost of fine-tuning LLMs, making the system more adaptable to evolving domain knowledge and API structures. In summary, KG2data provides a novel solution for intelligent, knowledge-based question answering and data analysis in domains with high knowledge demands.

Abstract: The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static, document-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users' behalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become more capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across different communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered frameworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Semantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation obscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic understanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive evolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and the MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations of earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To systematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic foundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery mechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing agent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent where others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift in the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic Web) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model (LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable and adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new protocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open, trustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies in solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda focused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance for the emerging WoA.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel rule-based method for creating music by manipulating existing tunes. The approach involves parsing each tune to identify the Pathway Assembly using the Sequitur algorithm, resulting in a grammar representation. Mutations are then applied to the grammar, such as adding, removing, swapping, or reversing parts, to generate new tunes. The study investigates how tunes evolve through multiple mutations, analyzing factors like edit distances, structural complexity, and length. The impact of different mutation types on the tunes is also examined. The focus is on generating new pitch sequences from an Irish traditional tune dataset, using integers to represent pitch values. The output tunes are evaluated from a musical perspective, showcasing the potential for creating diverse musical variations through rule-based manipulation.<br /> 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel rule-based approach for generating music by varying existing tunes. We parse each tune to find the Pathway Assembly (PA) [ 1], that is a structure representing all repetitions in the tune. The Sequitur algorithm [2 ] is used for this. The result is a grammar. We then carry out mutation on the grammar, rather than on a tune directly. There are potentially 19 types of mutations such as adding, removing, swapping or reversing parts of the grammar that can be applied to the grammars. The system employs one of the mutations randomly in this step to automatically manipulate the grammar. Following the mutation, we need to expand the grammar which returns a new tune. The output after 1 or more mutations will be a new tune related to the original tune. Our study examines how tunes change gradually over the course of multiple mutations. Edit distances, structural complexity and length of the tunes are used to show how a tune is changed after multiple mutations. In addition, the size of effect of each mutation type is analyzed. As a final point, we review the musical aspect of the output tunes. It should be noted that the study only focused on generating new pitch sequences. The study is based on an Irish traditional tune dataset and a list of integers has been used to represent each tune's pitch values.

Summary:
In this technical review article, the impact of AI on energy consumption and GHG emissions in data centers is investigated. The near-term scenario suggests that the increasing demand for AI may lead to higher electricity consumption and CO2 emissions due to the power-intensive nature of data centers and the requirements for AI models. However, in the long term, AI has the potential to significantly reduce CO2 emissions by automating and optimizing processes across industries. Despite the initial emissions bump, AI could support climate mitigation efforts and create value for businesses and society where traditional solutions have failed. The article suggests that while AI may initially strain the environment, its potential to drive CO2 reduction makes it a valuable tool in addressing climate change. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Thanks to the availability of massive amounts of data, computing resources, and advanced algorithms, AI has entered nearly every sector. This has sparked significant investment and interest, particularly in building data centers with the necessary hardware and software to develop and operate AI models and AI-based workflows. In this technical review article, we present energy consumption scenarios of data centers and impact on GHG emissions, considering both near-term projections (up to 2030) and long-term outlook (2035 and beyond). We address the quintessential question of whether AI will have a net positive, neutral, or negative impact on CO2 emissions by 2035. Additionally, we discuss AI's potential to automate, create efficient and disruptive workflows across various fields related to energy production, supply and consumption. In the near-term scenario, the growing demand for AI will likely strain computing resources, lead to increase in electricity consumption and therefore associated CO2 emissions. This is due to the power-hungry nature of big data centers and the requirements for training and running of large and complex AI models, as well as the penetration of AI assistant search and applications for public use. However, the long-term outlook could be more promising. AI has the potential to be a game-changer in CO2 reduction. Its ability to further automate and optimize processes across industries, from energy production to logistics, could significantly decrease our carbon footprint. This positive impact is anticipated to outweigh the initial emissions bump, creating value for businesses and society in areas where traditional solutions have fallen short. In essence, AI might cause some initial growing pains for the environment, but it has the potential to support climate mitigation efforts.

Abstract: This paper intends to detect IoT malicious attacks through deep learning models and demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning and graph-based models regarding malicious network traffic detection. The models particularly are based on GraphSAGE, Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) as well as Multi-Head Attention, together with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BI-LSTM) Multi-Head Attention and BI-LSTM and LSTM models. The chosen models demonstrated great performance to model temporal patterns and detect feature significance. The observed performance are mainly due to the fact that IoT system traffic patterns are both sequential and diverse, leaving a rich set of temporal patterns for the models to learn. Experimental results showed that BERT maintained the best performance. It achieved 99.94% accuracy rate alongside high precision and recall, F1-score and AUC-ROC score of 99.99% which demonstrates its capabilities through temporal dependency capture. The Multi-Head Attention offered promising results by providing good detection capabilities with interpretable results. On the other side, the Multi-Head Attention model required significant processing time like BI-LSTM variants. The GraphSAGE model achieved good accuracy while requiring the shortest training time but yielded the lowest accuracy, precision, and F1 score compared to the other models

Summary:
- Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is crucial as AI becomes more prevalent in complex tasks.
- Artificial neural networks are effective at classification tasks due to their ability to process large amounts of data.
- Detecting AI assistance can be challenging, especially with abstract task data.
- Common models can classify non-machine learning-friendly data effectively with appropriate preprocessing.
- Different image formulations and a time-series formulation are created to classify abstract task data, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial quantities for accurate detection of AI aid. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting assistance from artificial intelligence is increasingly important as they become ubiquitous across complex tasks such as text generation, medical diagnosis, and autonomous driving. Aid detection is challenging for humans, especially when looking at abstract task data. Artificial neural networks excel at classification thanks to their ability to quickly learn from and process large amounts of data -- assuming appropriate preprocessing. We posit detecting help from AI as a classification task for such models. Much of the research in this space examines the classification of complex but concrete data classes, such as images. Many AI assistance detection scenarios, however, result in data that is not machine learning-friendly. We demonstrate that common models can effectively classify such data when it is appropriately preprocessed. To do so, we construct four distinct neural network-friendly image formulations along with an additional time-series formulation that explicitly encodes the exploration/exploitation of users, which allows for generalizability to other abstract tasks. We benchmark the quality of each image formulation across three classical deep learning architectures, along with a parallel CNN-RNN architecture that leverages the additional time series to maximize testing performance, showcasing the importance of encoding temporal and spatial quantities for detecting AI aid in abstract tasks.

<div> Keywords: mHealth, decision making, just-in-time adaptive interventions, SigmaScheduling, habitual behavior <br />
<br />
Summary: Timely decision making is crucial for mHealth interventions, especially for habitual behaviors like oral hygiene. Current fixed interval scheduling may lead to ineffective interventions for individuals with irregular routines. To address this issue, SigmaScheduling dynamically schedules decision points based on the uncertainty in predicted behavior times. This method adjusts the timing of interventions based on how predictable the behavior is, increasing the likelihood of timely support. Evaluation of SigmaScheduling with real-world data from a JITAI for daily toothbrushing showed promising results, with decision points preceding brushing events in the majority of cases. The findings suggest that SigmaScheduling can enhance precision mHealth interventions, particularly for behaviors that require timely support. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timely decision making is critical to the effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. At predefined timepoints called "decision points," intelligent mHealth systems such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) estimate an individual's biobehavioral context from sensor or survey data and determine whether and how to intervene. For interventions targeting habitual behavior (e.g., oral hygiene), effectiveness often hinges on delivering support shortly before the target behavior is likely to occur. Current practice schedules decision points at a fixed interval (e.g., one hour) before user-provided behavior times, and the fixed interval is kept the same for all individuals. However, this one-size-fits-all approach performs poorly for individuals with irregular routines, often scheduling decision points after the target behavior has already occurred, rendering interventions ineffective. In this paper, we propose SigmaScheduling, a method to dynamically schedule decision points based on uncertainty in predicted behavior times. When behavior timing is more predictable, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points closer to the predicted behavior time; when timing is less certain, SigmaScheduling schedules decision points earlier, increasing the likelihood of timely intervention. We evaluated SigmaScheduling using real-world data from 68 participants in a 10-week trial of Oralytics, a JITAI designed to improve daily toothbrushing. SigmaScheduling increased the likelihood that decision points preceded brushing events in at least 70% of cases, preserving opportunities to intervene and impact behavior. Our results indicate that SigmaScheduling can advance precision mHealth, particularly for JITAIs targeting time-sensitive, habitual behaviors such as oral hygiene or dietary habits.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are being tested for their ability to replicate expert-driven thematic analysis of social media data. In this study, five LLMs were evaluated using Reddit datasets on xylazine. By modeling the task as a series of binary classifications and employing zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies, the best performing model, GPT-4o with two-shot prompting, achieved an accuracy of 90.9% and an F1-score of 0.71 on the validation set. The model-derived thematic distributions closely mirrored expert classifications for high-prevalence themes. The study concludes that few-shot LLM-based approaches can automate thematic analyses effectively, providing a scalable supplement for qualitative research in public health.

Abstract: Background Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in inductive thematic analysis, a task requiring deep interpretive and domain-specific expertise. We evaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic analysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting Reddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and validation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five LLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary classifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing zero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set, GPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score: 0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely mirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use: 16.5% vs. 17.8%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that few-shot LLM-based approaches can automate thematic analyses, offering a scalable supplement for qualitative research.

Summary: <br />
AF-XRAY is a toolkit designed to aid in the exploration, analysis, and visualization of abstract argumentation frameworks in legal reasoning. It provides layered visualizations to reveal derivation structures, classifies attack edges by semantic roles, overlays alternative solutions on ambiguous scenarios, and identifies critical attack sets to resolve undecided arguments. By systematically generating critical attack sets, AF-XRAY helps pinpoint sources of ambiguity and explore alternate resolutions in real-world legal cases. The tool supports teleological legal reasoning by showing how different assumptions can lead to varying justified conclusions. <div>

Abstract: Argumentation frameworks (AFs) provide formal approaches for legal reasoning, but identifying sources of ambiguity and explaining argument acceptance remains challenging for non-experts. We present AF-XRAY, an open-source toolkit for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing abstract AFs in legal reasoning. AF-XRAY introduces: (i) layered visualizations based on game-theoretic argument length revealing well-founded derivation structures; (ii) classification of attack edges by semantic roles (primary, secondary, blunders); (iii) overlay visualizations of alternative 2-valued solutions on ambiguous 3-valued grounded semantics; and (iv) identification of critical attack sets whose suspension resolves undecided arguments. Through systematic generation of critical attack sets, AF-XRAY transforms ambiguous scenarios into grounded solutions, enabling users to pinpoint specific causes of ambiguity and explore alternative resolutions. We use real-world legal cases (e.g., Wild Animals as modeled by Bench-Capon) to show that our tool supports teleological legal reasoning by revealing how different assumptions lead to different justified conclusions.

<div> Keywords: Language-guided navigation, NavComposer, NavInstrCritic, semantic entities, instruction generation

Summary:
NavComposer is a framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions by decomposing and recomposing semantic entities. It enhances instruction richness and accuracy with a modular architecture that supports flexible integration of techniques. NavComposer operates in a data-agnostic manner, enabling adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. NavInstrCritic is introduced for annotation-free evaluation, assessing instruction quality based on contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. This holistic evaluation system addresses limitations of traditional metrics reliant on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, the method facilitates scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NavComposer and NavInstrCritic in generating and evaluating navigation instructions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-guided navigation is a cornerstone of embodied AI, enabling agents to interpret language instructions and navigate complex environments. However, expert-provided instructions are limited in quantity, while synthesized annotations often lack quality, making them insufficient for large-scale research. To address this, we propose NavComposer, a novel framework for automatically generating high-quality navigation instructions. NavComposer explicitly decomposes semantic entities such as actions, scenes, and objects, and recomposes them into natural language instructions. Its modular architecture allows flexible integration of state-of-the-art techniques, while the explicit use of semantic entities enhances both the richness and accuracy of instructions. Moreover, it operates in a data-agnostic manner, supporting adaptation to diverse navigation trajectories without domain-specific training. Complementing NavComposer, we introduce NavInstrCritic, a comprehensive annotation-free evaluation system that assesses navigation instructions on three dimensions: contrastive matching, semantic consistency, and linguistic diversity. NavInstrCritic provides a holistic evaluation of instruction quality, addressing limitations of traditional metrics that rely heavily on expert annotations. By decoupling instruction generation and evaluation from specific navigation agents, our method enables more scalable and generalizable research. Extensive experiments provide direct and practical evidence for the effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: therapy recommendation, chronic patients, multimorbidity, Large Language Model, multi-agent system <br />
Summary: <br />
This study explores the use of a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent system (MAS) for therapy recommendation in chronic patients with multimorbidity. The MAS simulates multidisciplinary team decision-making, allowing discussion among LLM agents to resolve medical conflicts. Evaluation metrics beyond technical precision and recall were defined to assess clinical goals met and medication burden. Results showed that a single agent GP performed equally well as MAS in therapy planning tasks. The best-scoring models met clinical goals but provided incomplete advice, leading to unnecessary medications and potential conflicts. This study highlights the potential for LLM-based MAS in therapy recommendation but also emphasizes the need for further refinement to address medication burden and avoid unnecessary conflicts in treatment. <br /> 
Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2507.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug interactions.

Abstract: Protein language models have emerged as powerful tools for sequence generation, offering substantial advantages in functional optimization and denovo design. However, these models also present significant risks of generating harmful protein sequences, such as those that enhance viral transmissibility or evade immune responses. These concerns underscore critical biosafety and ethical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a Knowledge-guided Preference Optimization (KPO) framework that integrates prior knowledge via a Protein Safety Knowledge Graph. This framework utilizes an efficient graph pruning strategy to identify preferred sequences and employs reinforcement learning to minimize the risk of generating harmful proteins. Experimental results demonstrate that KPO effectively reduces the likelihood of producing hazardous sequences while maintaining high functionality, offering a robust safety assurance framework for applying generative models in biotechnology.

Summary:
Climate-induced changes are causing habitats to shift, leading to the need for accurate modeling of bird species presence in different climates. A solution proposed involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and tabular data to predict bird presence by combining satellite imagery and environmental features. The CNN model focuses on capturing spatial features like forestation, water bodies, and urbanization, while the tabular method incorporates ecological and geographic data. Both systems together achieve an average accuracy of 85% in predicting bird distribution. This approach offers a scalable and reliable method to understand bird migration patterns in response to changing environments. <div>

Abstract: Due to climate-induced changes, many habitats are experiencing range shifts away from their traditional geographic locations (Piguet, 2011). We propose a solution to accurately model whether bird species are present in a specific habitat through the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (O'Shea, 2015) and tabular data. Our approach makes use of satellite imagery and environmental features (e.g., temperature, precipitation, elevation) to predict bird presence across various climates. The CNN model captures spatial characteristics of landscapes such as forestation, water bodies, and urbanization, whereas the tabular method uses ecological and geographic data. Both systems predict the distribution of birds with an average accuracy of 85%, offering a scalable but reliable method to understand bird migration.

arXiv:2507.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce ExRec, a general framework for personalized exercise recommendation with semantically-grounded knowledge tracing. Our method builds on the observation that existing exercise recommendation approaches simulate student performance via knowledge tracing (KT) but they often overlook two key aspects: (a) the semantic content of questions and (b) the sequential, structured progression of student learning. To address this, our ExRec presents an end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their semantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard Q-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value estimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in estimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of our ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different educational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec generalizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces interpretable student learning trajectories. Together, our findings highlight the promise of KT-guided RL for effective personalization in education.

Summary: 
This study introduces a new approach for autonomously evolving multi-agent tactical decisions in unmanned ground vehicle confrontations. Traditional rule-based methods are inefficient in complex battle environments, while current reinforcement learning techniques lack interpretability for strategic decisions. The proposed method combines a vision-language model for scene understanding with a large language model for strategic reasoning. By integrating these two modules, the approach enables unified perception and decision-making in a shared semantic space, offering adaptability and interpretability. Unlike rule-based and reinforcement learning methods, this approach mirrors the cognitive process of human commanders. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a win rate exceeding 80% compared to baseline models. <div>
arXiv:2507.11079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiple unmanned ground vehicle confrontations, autonomously evolving multi-agent tactical decisions from situational awareness remain a significant challenge. Traditional handcraft rule-based methods become vulnerable in the complicated and transient battlefield environment, and current reinforcement learning methods mainly focus on action manipulation instead of strategic decisions due to lack of interpretability. Here, we propose a vision-language model-based commander to address the issue of intelligent perception-to-decision reasoning in autonomous confrontations. Our method integrates a vision language model for scene understanding and a lightweight large language model for strategic reasoning, achieving unified perception and decision within a shared semantic space, with strong adaptability and interpretability. Unlike rule-based search and reinforcement learning methods, the combination of the two modules establishes a full-chain process, reflecting the cognitive process of human commanders. Simulation and ablation experiments validate that the proposed approach achieves a win rate of over 80% compared with baseline models.

Summary: 
F2STrans introduces a function-to-style paradigm to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in code translation tasks. The approach consists of two stages: Functional learning focuses on optimizing translation correctness using high-quality source-target code pairs, while Style learning aims to improve translation readability by incorporating positive and negative style examples. A new code translation benchmark is introduced, featuring up-to-date source code, comprehensive test cases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations for thorough evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate that F2STrans significantly enhances code translation performance, with Qwen-1.5B outperforming prompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 in various code translation scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code translation tasks. However, ensuring both the correctness and readability of translated code remains a challenge, limiting their effective adoption in real-world software development. In this work, we propose F2STrans, a function-to-style guiding paradigm designed to progressively improve the performance of LLMs in code translation. Our approach comprises two key stages: (1) Functional learning, which optimizes translation correctness using high-quality source-target code pairs mined from online programming platforms, and (2) Style learning, which improves translation readability by incorporating both positive and negative style examples. Additionally, we introduce a novel code translation benchmark that includes up-to-date source code, extensive test cases, and manually annotated ground-truth translations, enabling comprehensive functional and stylistic evaluations. Experiments on both our new benchmark and existing datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves code translation performance. Notably, our approach enables Qwen-1.5B to outperform prompt-enhanced Qwen-32B and GPT-4 on average across 20 diverse code translation scenarios.

Abstract: Decentralized trading of real-world alternative assets (e.g., gold) requires bridging physical asset custody with blockchain systems while meeting strict requirements for compliance, liquidity, and risk management. We present GoldMine OS, a research oriented architecture that employs multiple specialized AI agents to automate and secure the tokenization and exchange of physical gold into a blockchain based stablecoin ("OZ"). Our approach combines on chain smart contracts for critical risk controls with off chain AI agents for decision making, blending the transparency and reliability of blockchains with the flexibility of AI driven automation. We describe four cooperative agents (Compliance, Token Issuance, Market Making, and Risk Control) and a coordinating core, and evaluate the system through simulation and a controlled pilot deployment. In experiments the prototype delivers on demand token issuance in under 1.2 s, more than 100 times faster than manual workflows. The Market Making agent maintains tight liquidity with spreads often below 0.5 percent even under volatile conditions. Fault injection tests show resilience: an oracle price spoofing attack is detected and mitigated within 10 s, and a simulated vault mis reporting halts issuance immediately with minimal user impact. The architecture scales to 5000 transactions per second with 10000 concurrent users in benchmarks. These results indicate that an AI agent based decentralized exchange for alternative assets can satisfy rigorous performance and safety requirements. We discuss broader implications for democratizing access to traditionally illiquid assets and explain how our governance model -- multi signature agent updates and on chain community voting on risk parameters -- provides ongoing transparency, adaptability, and formal assurance of system integrity.

Summary:
Neurosymbolic AI aims to combine learning and reasoning by merging logical and neural representations. Despite the abundance of neurosymbolic AI systems, a widely accepted formal definition is still lacking. This paper introduces a formal definition for neurosymbolic AI that abstracts its fundamental elements. Specifically, neurosymbolic inference is defined as the computation of an integral involving a logical function and a belief function. This definition encapsulates the essence of various neurosymbolic AI systems. This formal definition sets a foundation for understanding the core concepts of neurosymbolic AI and paves the way for further research and development in this field. <div>

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI focuses on integrating learning and reasoning, in particular, on unifying logical and neural representations. Despite the existence of an alphabet soup of neurosymbolic AI systems, the field is lacking a generally accepted formal definition of what neurosymbolic models and inference really are. We introduce a formal definition for neurosymbolic AI that makes abstraction of its key ingredients. More specifically, we define neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over a product of a logical and a belief function. We show that our neurosymbolic AI definition makes abstraction of key representative neurosymbolic AI systems.

Summary:
- Autonomous systems are being used in various applications, facing challenges in ensuring safety and correct behavior in dynamic environments.
- A collaborative approach is proposed to enhance trustworthiness and reliability in autonomous systems' decision-making processes.
- Trustworthiness is assessed based on different quality attributes such as perception quality, rather than relying on consensus or majority agreement.
- Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) are used as formal models for aggregating and propagating beliefs, with reduction rules to optimize computational efficiency.
- Social epistemology concepts are applied to define aggregation and propagation rules for automated decision making in autonomous systems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous systems are becoming an integral part of many application domains, like in the mobility sector. However, ensuring their safe and correct behaviour in dynamic and complex environments remains a significant challenge, where systems should autonomously make decisions e.g., about manoeuvring. We propose in this paper a general collaborative approach for increasing the level of trustworthiness in the environment of operation and improve reliability and good decision making in autonomous system. In the presence of conflicting information, aggregation becomes a major issue for trustworthy decision making based on collaborative data sharing. Unlike classical approaches in the literature that rely on consensus or majority as aggregation rule, we exploit the fact that autonomous systems have different quality attributes like perception quality. We use this criteria to determine which autonomous systems are trustworthy and borrow concepts from social epistemology to define aggregation and propagation rules, used for automated decision making. We use Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) as formal models for beliefs aggregation and propagation, and formulate reduction rules to reduce the size of the BDDs and allow efficient computation structures for collaborative automated reasoning.

<div> maximum delay, combinational modules, integrated circuits, Static Timing Analysis, Answer Set Programming

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of maximum delay in integrated circuit design, which is crucial for determining the time taken to perform computations like arithmetic operations in circuits. It highlights the impact of maximum delay on the clock frequency of synchronous systems such as CPUs. While Static Timing Analysis is commonly used to estimate maximum delay, it may not result in optimal processor speeds. The research aims to accurately compute the actual maximum delay using Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language known for efficient solvers. By modeling the problem in ASP, the study shows that ASP can effectively address complex issues in hardware design. The experimental results demonstrate the viability of using ASP to tackle challenging tasks in integrated circuit design. <div>
arXiv:2507.11150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the design of integrated circuits, one critical metric is the maximum delay introduced by combinational modules within the circuit. This delay is crucial because it represents the time required to perform a computation: in an Arithmetic-Logic Unit it represents the maximum time taken by the circuit to perform an arithmetic operation. When such a circuit is part of a larger, synchronous system, like a CPU, the maximum delay directly impacts the maximum clock frequency of the entire system. Typically, hardware designers use Static Timing Analysis to compute an upper bound of the maximum delay because it can be determined in polynomial time. However, relying on this upper bound can lead to suboptimal processor speeds, thereby missing performance opportunities. In this work, we tackle the challenging task of computing the actual maximum delay, rather than an approximate value. Since the problem is computationally hard, we model it in Answer Set Programming (ASP), a logic language featuring extremely efficient solvers. We propose non-trivial encodings of the problem into ASP. Experimental results show that ASP is a viable solution to address complex problems in hardware design.

<div> Keywords: Knowledge graphs, KG reasoning, DuetGraph, global-local fusion, over-smoothing 

Summary: 
DuetGraph is a novel approach for Knowledge Graph (KG) reasoning that addresses the issue of score over-smoothing. It incorporates a dual-pathway global-local fusion mechanism to separate the processing of local and global information, preventing interference and enhancing representational discrimination. The method also introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy that divides entities into high- and low-score subsets, narrowing the candidate space and improving inference quality. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements in reasoning quality and training efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2507.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for enabling knowledge reasoning across various domains. Recent KG reasoning methods that integrate both global and local information have achieved promising results. However, existing methods often suffer from score over-smoothing, which blurs the distinction between correct and incorrect answers and hinders reasoning effectiveness. To address this, we propose DuetGraph, a coarse-to-fine KG reasoning mechanism with dual-pathway global-local fusion. DuetGraph tackles over-smoothing by segregating -- rather than stacking -- the processing of local (via message passing) and global (via attention) information into two distinct pathways, preventing mutual interference and preserving representational discrimination. In addition, DuetGraph introduces a coarse-to-fine optimization, which partitions entities into high- and low-score subsets. This strategy narrows the candidate space and sharpens the score gap between the two subsets, which alleviates over-smoothing and enhances inference quality. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that DuetGraph achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with up to an 8.7% improvement in reasoning quality and a 1.8$\times$ acceleration in training efficiency.

Summary: 
The paper introduces AgentOps, a framework designed to address the unique challenges posed by agentic AI systems powered by Large Language Models. These systems introduce uncertainty due to probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths, requiring a new approach to observability and operations. AgentOps caters to the needs of developers, testers, SREs, and business users throughout the system's lifecycle. The AgentOps Automation Pipeline comprises six stages, including behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Emphasizing the importance of automation, the framework aims to manage uncertainty and facilitate self-improvement of AI systems by ensuring safe, adaptive, and effective operation. <div>
arXiv:2507.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed within agentic systems-collections of interacting, LLM-powered agents that execute complex, adaptive workflows using memory, tools, and dynamic planning. While enabling powerful new capabilities, these systems also introduce unique forms of uncertainty stemming from probabilistic reasoning, evolving memory states, and fluid execution paths. Traditional software observability and operations practices fall short in addressing these challenges.
  This paper introduces AgentOps: a comprehensive framework for observing, analyzing, optimizing, and automating operation of agentic AI systems. We identify distinct needs across four key roles-developers, testers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and business users-each of whom engages with the system at different points in its lifecycle. We present the AgentOps Automation Pipeline, a six-stage process encompassing behavior observation, metric collection, issue detection, root cause analysis, optimized recommendations, and runtime automation. Throughout, we emphasize the critical role of automation in managing uncertainty and enabling self-improving AI systems-not by eliminating uncertainty, but by taming it to ensure safe, adaptive, and effective operation.

Summary: 
The Opus Prompt Intention Framework aims to enhance Workflow Generation using Large Language Models by introducing an Intention Capture layer. This layer extracts Workflow Signals from user queries, interprets them into structured Workflow Intentions, and generates Workflows based on these Intentions. By implementing this framework, LLMs are able to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale effectively with query complexity. Results from a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent query-Workflow pairs demonstrate improved semantic Workflow similarity metrics when applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework. The system significantly enhances Workflow Generation quality compared to direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases involving Mixed Intention Elicitation. This customizable, reproducible system provides a method for extracting Workflow Signals and Intentions from user queries, leading to improved Workflow Generation outcomes.

arXiv:2507.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Opus Prompt Intention Framework, designed to improve complex Workflow Generation with instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose an intermediate Intention Capture layer between user queries and Workflow Generation, implementing the Opus Workflow Intention Framework, which consists of extracting Workflow Signals from user queries, interpreting them into structured Workflow Intention objects, and generating Workflows based on these Intentions. Our results show that this layer enables LLMs to produce logical and meaningful outputs that scale reliably as query complexity increases. On a synthetic benchmark of 1,000 multi-intent query-Workflow(s) pairs, applying the Opus Prompt Intention Framework to Workflow Generation yields consistent improvements in semantic Workflow similarity metrics. In this paper, we introduce the Opus Prompt Intention Framework by applying the concepts of Workflow Signal and Workflow Intention to LLM-driven Workflow Generation. We present a reproducible, customizable LLM-based Intention Capture system to extract Workflow Signals and Workflow Intentions from user queries. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the proposed system significantly improves Workflow Generation quality compared to direct generation from user queries, particularly in cases of Mixed Intention Elicitation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (EW-QBAFs) for ensuring AI decisions align with human preferences. It addresses the contestability problem in EW-QBAFs by proposing gradient-based relation attribution explanations (G-RAEs) to guide weight adjustments towards desired argument strength. An iterative algorithm is developed to adjust edge weights effectively. Experimental evaluation on synthetic EW-QBAFs simulating recommender systems and multi-layer perceptrons demonstrates the approach's efficacy. <div>

Abstract: Contestable AI requires that AI-driven decisions align with human preferences. While various forms of argumentation have been shown to support contestability, Edge-Weighted Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (EW-QBAFs) have received little attention. In this work, we show how EW-QBAFs can be deployed for this purpose. Specifically, we introduce the contestability problem for EW-QBAFs, which asks how to modify edge weights (e.g., preferences) to achieve a desired strength for a specific argument of interest (i.e., a topic argument). To address this problem, we propose gradient-based relation attribution explanations (G-RAEs), which quantify the sensitivity of the topic argument's strength to changes in individual edge weights, thus providing interpretable guidance for weight adjustments towards contestability. Building on G-RAEs, we develop an iterative algorithm that progressively adjusts the edge weights to attain the desired strength. We evaluate our approach experimentally on synthetic EW-QBAFs that simulate the structural characteristics of personalised recommender systems and multi-layer perceptrons, and demonstrate that it can solve the problem effectively.

Abstract: Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However, traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions. Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in navigation accuracy and adaptability.

Summary:
A new neurosymbolic framework has been introduced to address the challenges faced by logistics operators in making critical decisions. This framework combines natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation, enabling the conversion of user requests into structured planning specifications. It also quantifies uncertainty at the field and token levels and initiates an interactive clarification loop when confidence is low. A lightweight model, trained on a small dataset, outperforms GPT-4.1 in zero-shot performance while reducing inference latency by nearly 50%. These results demonstrate a practical approach to achieving certifiable, real-time decision-making in complex logistics scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2507.11352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logistics operators, from battlefield coordinators rerouting airlifts ahead of a storm to warehouse managers juggling late trucks, often face life-critical decisions that demand both domain expertise and rapid and continuous replanning. While popular methods like integer programming yield logistics plans that satisfy user-defined logical constraints, they are slow and assume an idealized mathematical model of the environment that does not account for uncertainty. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can handle uncertainty and promise to accelerate replanning while lowering the barrier to entry by translating free-form utterances into executable plans, yet they remain prone to misinterpretations and hallucinations that jeopardize safety and cost. We introduce a neurosymbolic framework that pairs the accessibility of natural-language dialogue with verifiable guarantees on goal interpretation. It converts user requests into structured planning specifications, quantifies its own uncertainty at the field and token level, and invokes an interactive clarification loop whenever confidence falls below an adaptive threshold. A lightweight model, fine-tuned on just 100 uncertainty-filtered examples, surpasses the zero-shot performance of GPT-4.1 while cutting inference latency by nearly 50%. These preliminary results highlight a practical path toward certifiable, real-time, and user-aligned decision-making for complex logistics.

Nevertheless, it shows promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability.

Summary: 
Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges concerning agency definition, learning objective, and reward hypothesis. The framework proposed in this article draws inspiration from open-ended evolutionary theory to rethink these fundamental aspects. Evolutionary dynamics operating within individual brains are considered. The adaptation-focused view of learning is enriched with insights from evolution. The debate on scalar reward versus multi-objectives is explored using analogies from evolutionary fitness. Practical implications for exploration in RL are discussed. The absence of a formal account of agency, a core issue, is acknowledged. While the evolutionary paradigm offers some insights, it alone cannot resolve the agency question. Ideas from origins-of-life theory are proposed to provide a foundation for understanding agency and resource-constrained reinforcement learning in biological systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.11482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three core tenets of reinforcement learning (RL)--concerning the definition of agency, the objective of learning, and the scope of the reward hypothesis--have been highlighted as key targets for conceptual revision, with major implications for theory and application. We propose a framework, inspired by open-ended evolutionary theory, to reconsider these three "dogmas." We revisit each assumption and address related concerns raised alongside them. To make our arguments relevant to RL as a model of biological learning, we first establish that evolutionary dynamics can plausibly operate within living brains over an individual's lifetime, and are not confined to cross-generational processes. We begin by revisiting the second dogma, drawing on evolutionary insights to enrich the "adaptation-rather-than-search" view of learning. We then address the third dogma regarding the limits of the reward hypothesis, using analogies from evolutionary fitness to illuminate the scalar reward vs. multi-objective debate. After discussing practical implications for exploration in RL, we turn to the first--and arguably most fundamental--issue: the absence of a formal account of agency. We argue that unlike the other two problems, the evolutionary paradigm alone cannot resolve the agency question, though it gestures in a productive direction. We advocate integrating ideas from origins-of-life theory, where the thermodynamics of sustenance and replication offer promising foundations for understanding agency and resource-constrained reinforcement learning in biological systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown great potential for solving real-world problems and promise to be a solution for tasks automation in industry. However, more benchmarks are needed to systematically evaluate automation agents from an industrial perspective, for example, in Civil Engineering. Therefore, we propose DrafterBench for the comprehensive evaluation of LLM agents in the context of technical drawing revision, a representation task in civil engineering. DrafterBench contains twelve types of tasks summarized from real-world drawing files, with 46 customized functions/tools and 1920 tasks in total. DrafterBench is an open-source benchmark to rigorously test AI agents' proficiency in interpreting intricate and long-context instructions, leveraging prior knowledge, and adapting to dynamic instruction quality via implicit policy awareness. The toolkit comprehensively assesses distinct capabilities in structured data comprehension, function execution, instruction following, and critical reasoning. DrafterBench offers detailed analysis of task accuracy and error statistics, aiming to provide deeper insight into agent capabilities and identify improvement targets for integrating LLMs in engineering applications. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/Eason-Li-AIS/DrafterBench, with the test set hosted at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Eason666/DrafterBench.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces IFScale, a benchmark with 500 keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to evaluate LLM systems' instruction-following performance at high densities. 20 state-of-the-art models were tested across multiple providers, with the best achieving 68% accuracy at the maximum density. The analysis identified correlations between model size and reasoning capability with distinct performance degradation patterns, bias towards earlier instructions, and categories of instruction-following errors. The insights gained can inform the design of instruction-dense prompts in real-world applications and highlight performance-latency tradeoffs. The benchmark and results are open-sourced for further analysis at https://distylai.github.io/IFScale. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Production-grade LLM systems require robust adherence to dozens or even hundreds of instructions simultaneously. However, the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs at high instruction densities have not yet been characterized, as existing benchmarks only evaluate models on tasks with a single or few instructions. We introduce IFScale, a simple benchmark of 500 keyword-inclusion instructions for a business report writing task to measure how instruction-following performance degrades as instruction density increases. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models across seven major providers and find that even the best frontier models only achieve 68% accuracy at the max density of 500 instructions. Our analysis reveals model size and reasoning capability to correlate with 3 distinct performance degradation patterns, bias towards earlier instructions, and distinct categories of instruction-following errors. Our insights can help inform design of instruction-dense prompts in real-world applications and highlight important performance-latency tradeoffs. We open-source the benchmark and all results for further analysis at https://distylai.github.io/IFScale.

<br />
Group resilience in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings is formalized and investigated in this work. The focus is on the resilience of a group of agents to unexpected changes in their environment. The hypothesis is that collaboration with other agents is essential for achieving group resilience. Various collaboration protocols are evaluated empirically, showing that collaborative approaches outperform non-collaborative ones in terms of group resilience. The study highlights the importance of collaboration in achieving resilience in dynamic scenarios, emphasizing the benefits of agents working together to adapt to environmental perturbations. The findings suggest that collaborative approaches can enhance the overall robustness and adaptability of multi-agent systems, making them more effective in diverse and unpredictable environments. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: To effectively operate in various dynamic scenarios, RL agents must be resilient to unexpected changes in their environment. Previous work on this form of resilience has focused on single-agent settings. In this work, we introduce and formalize a multi-agent variant of resilience, which we term group resilience. We further hypothesize that collaboration with other agents is key to achieving group resilience; collaborating agents adapt better to environmental perturbations in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) settings. We test our hypothesis empirically by evaluating different collaboration protocols and examining their effect on group resilience. Our experiments show that all the examined collaborative approaches achieve higher group resilience than their non-collaborative counterparts.

<div> Keywords: large language models, natural language processing, communication, public understanding, ethical concerns

Summary:
Vague terminology in communicating about large language models (LLMs) can hinder public understanding. It is important to address unreasonable expectations regarding LLM capabilities to ensure sustainable growth in the field. Ethical failures within NLP research can lead to a lack of continued support from the public. By providing transparent communication with the general audience about LLMs, researchers can strengthen public understanding and foster support for further research. The recommendations outlined in the paper aim to bridge the gap between research advancements in NLP and public perception, emphasizing the importance of clear and ethical communication practices to maintain public trust and support for ongoing research efforts. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2507.10559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have been accompanied by rapidly growing public interest in natural language processing (NLP). This attention is reflected by major news venues, which sometimes invite NLP researchers to share their knowledge and views with a wide audience. Recognizing the opportunities of the present, for both the research field and for individual researchers, this paper shares recommendations for communicating with a general audience about LLMs' capabilities and limitations. These recommendations cover three themes: vague terminology as an obstacle to public understanding, unreasonable expectations as obstacles to sustainable growth, and ethical failures as obstacles to continued support. Published NLP research and popular news coverage are cited to illustrate these themes with examples. The recommendations promote effective, transparent communication with the general public about NLP, in order to strengthen public understanding and encourage support for research.

<div> Coral-reef-inspired, Swarm Interaction Network, carbon-neutral, wastewater treatment, energy consumption <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The study introduces a novel approach to carbon-neutral wastewater treatment inspired by coral reefs. By utilizing a Swarm Interaction Network, the system achieves high removal efficiency of 96.7% with low energy consumption of 0.31 kWh/m3 and minimal CO2 emissions of 14.2 g/m3. The scalability of the system is attributed to its linear token complexity, addressing the energy-removal challenge. Field scenarios such as insular lagoons, brewery spikes, and desert greenhouses demonstrate potential diesel savings of up to 22%. Despite these promising results, the need for data-science staffing remains a barrier. Future work aims to incorporate AutoML wrappers to enhance the project, though challenges regarding governance restrictions and interpretability call for further visual analytics. <div>

Abstract: With increasing wastewater rates, achieving energy-neutral purification is challenging. We introduce a coral-reef-inspired Swarm Interaction Network for carbon-neutral wastewater treatment, combining morphogenetic abstraction with multi-task carbon awareness. Scalability stems from linear token complexity, mitigating the energy-removal problem. Compared with seven baselines, our approach achieves 96.7\% removal efficiency, 0.31~kWh~m$^{-3}$ energy consumption, and 14.2~g~m$^{-3}$ CO$_2$ emissions. Variance analysis demonstrates robustness under sensor drift. Field scenarios--insular lagoons, brewery spikes, and desert greenhouses--show potential diesel savings of up to 22\%. However, data-science staffing remains an impediment. Future work will integrate AutoML wrappers within the project scope, although governance restrictions pose interpretability challenges that require further visual analytics.

Summary:
The article discusses the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM) in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, focusing on overcoming challenges in a heterogeneous equipment setting. Traditional TTTM methods rely on static configuration data or a golden reference, which are hard to obtain in commercial manufacturing lines. The proposed TTTM analysis pipelines aim to address these issues by identifying equipment mismatches based on higher variance and number of modes in the data. Univariate methods showed high correlation coefficients with data variance and number of modes, indicating their effectiveness. Additionally, a multivariate method demonstrated a strong correlation with the top-performing univariate methods, highlighting its efficacy. The sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to hyperparameters was also analyzed. These novel approaches offer promising solutions for tool-to-tool matching in semiconductor manufacturing equipment.

Abstract: We consider the problem of tool-to-tool matching (TTTM), also called, chamber matching in the context of a semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Traditional TTTM approaches utilize static configuration data or depend on a golden reference which are difficult to obtain in a commercial manufacturing line. Further, existing methods do not extend very well to a heterogeneous setting, where equipment are of different make-and-model, sourced from different equipment vendors. We propose novel TTTM analysis pipelines to overcome these issues. We hypothesize that a mismatched equipment would have higher variance and/or higher number of modes in the data. Our best univariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.95 and >0.5 with the variance and number of modes, respectively showing that the proposed methods are effective. Also, the best multivariate method achieves a correlation coefficient >0.75 with the top-performing univariate methods, showing its effectiveness. Finally, we analyze the sensitivity of the multivariate algorithms to the algorithm hyper-parameters.

Summary:
The article introduces the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function, which is based on information theory. Compared to the standard cross entropy loss function, it includes an additional term that considers the predicted probability of the true class, enhancing optimization in classification tasks with one-hot encoded labels. The function was tested on a ResNet-based model using the CIFAR-100 dataset, showing consistent improvements in classification accuracy over the standard cross entropy loss. Despite the added complexity, the proposed function maintains simplicity and efficiency similar to traditional cross entropy loss. These results suggest potential for future research in loss function design and optimization techniques.

Abstract: We propose the Linearly Adaptive Cross Entropy Loss function. This is a novel measure derived from the information theory. In comparison to the standard cross entropy loss function, the proposed one has an additional term that depends on the predicted probability of the true class. This feature serves to enhance the optimization process in classification tasks involving one-hot encoded class labels. The proposed one has been evaluated on a ResNet-based model using the CIFAR-100 dataset. Preliminary results show that the proposed one consistently outperforms the standard cross entropy loss function in terms of classification accuracy. Moreover, the proposed one maintains simplicity, achieving practically the same efficiency to the traditional cross entropy loss. These findings suggest that our approach could broaden the scope for future research into loss function design.

<div> large language models, European Qualifying Examination, patent experts, model shortcomings, expert oversight

Summary:
The study evaluates various large language models on parts of the European Qualifying Examination for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI's GPT-4o outperformed others, with a high accuracy and F1 score. However, none of the models could fully pass the examination, highlighting the need for further development. Human patent experts found critical shortcomings in each model, emphasizing the importance of clarity and legal rationale over raw correctness. The models' outputs were sensitive to temperature changes and prompt wording, indicating the necessity of expert oversight. Future research should focus on logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. While large language models show promise, the public may overestimate their capabilities, as they still have limitations that need to be addressed. <div>
arXiv:2507.10576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual applications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are underexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs -- including GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of the European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys. OpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web Services) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama 3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for the two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have passed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold of 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are regularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level performance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3 Opus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the textual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each model. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the answers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert judgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt wording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future work should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive prompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the outstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might overestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a virtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific limitations that need solutions.

Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant threat in today's digital world, often spreading rapidly through platforms like YouTube. This paper introduces a novel approach to combating misinformation by developing an AI-powered system that not only fact-checks claims made in YouTube videos but also actively engages users in the comment section and challenge misleading narratives. Our system comprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.
  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search, Google FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced and comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender leverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to generate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive debate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to iteratively improve its style and refine its output.
  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established benchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its potential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives. Our findings highlight the high accuracy of our fact-checking agent, and confirm the potential of AI-driven interventions in combating misinformation and fostering a more informed online space.

<div> Keywords: poisoning attacks, diffusion models, textual inversion, semantic sensitivity maps, Safe-Zone Training<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper analyzes the vulnerability of diffusion models (DMs) to poisoning attacks, specifically focusing on textual inversion (TI) as a common target. Through the introduction of Semantic Sensitivity Maps, the influence of poisoning on text embeddings is visualized. The study reveals that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, with a bias towards lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks exploit this bias by injecting adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Adversarial signals distract DMs from relevant concept regions, corrupting the TI process. To counter these attacks, the proposed Safe-Zone Training (SZT) defense mechanism incorporates JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, restricted training to high timesteps during TI, and loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against various poisoning attacks, yielding improved generative quality compared to existing defenses. <div>

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose significant challenges to the robustness of diffusion models (DMs). In this paper, we systematically analyze when and where poisoning attacks textual inversion (TI), a widely used personalization technique for DMs. We first introduce Semantic Sensitivity Maps, a novel method for visualizing the influence of poisoning on text embeddings. Second, we identify and experimentally verify that DMs exhibit non-uniform learning behavior across timesteps, focusing on lower-noise samples. Poisoning attacks inherit this bias and inject adversarial signals predominantly at lower timesteps. Lastly, we observe that adversarial signals distract learning away from relevant concept regions within training data, corrupting the TI process. Based on these insights, we propose Safe-Zone Training (SZT), a novel defense mechanism comprised of 3 key components: (1) JPEG compression to weaken high-frequency poison signals, (2) restriction to high timesteps during TI training to avoid adversarial signals at lower timesteps, and (3) loss masking to constrain learning to relevant regions. Extensive experiments across multiple poisoning methods demonstrate that SZT greatly enhances the robustness of TI against all poisoning attacks, improving generative quality beyond prior published defenses.

Abstract: This shared task has aimed to assess pedagogical abilities of AI tutors powered by large language models (LLMs), focusing on evaluating the quality of tutor responses aimed at student's mistake remediation within educational dialogues. The task consisted of five tracks designed to automatically evaluate the AI tutor's performance across key dimensions of mistake identification, precise location of the mistake, providing guidance, and feedback actionability, grounded in learning science principles that define good and effective tutor responses, as well as the track focusing on detection of the tutor identity. The task attracted over 50 international teams across all tracks. The submitted models were evaluated against gold-standard human annotations, and the results, while promising, show that there is still significant room for improvement in this domain: the best results for the four pedagogical ability assessment tracks range between macro F1 scores of 58.34 (for providing guidance) and 71.81 (for mistake identification) on three-class problems, with the best F1 score in the tutor identification track reaching 96.98 on a 9-class task. In this paper, we overview the main findings of the shared task, discuss the approaches taken by the teams, and analyze their performance. All resources associated with this task are made publicly available to support future research in this critical domain.

Abstract: Mental health plays a crucial role in the overall well-being of an individual. In recent years, digital platforms have been increasingly used to expand mental health and emotional support. However, there are persistent challenges related to limited user accessibility, internet connectivity, and data privacy, which highlight the need for an offline, smartphone-based solution. To address these challenges, we propose EmoSApp (Emotional Support App): an entirely offline, smartphone-based conversational app designed for mental health and emotional support. The system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically fine-tuned, quantized and deployed using Torchtune and Executorch for resource-constrained devices, allowing all inferences to occur on the smartphone. To equip EmoSApp with robust domain expertise, we fine-tuned the LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct model on our custom curated ``Knowledge dataset'' of 14,582 mental-health QA pairs, along with the multi-turn conversational data.
  Through qualitative human evaluation with the student population, we demonstrate that EmoSApp has the ability to respond coherently, empathetically, maintain interactive dialogue, and provide relevant suggestions to user's mental health problems. Additionally, quantitative evaluations on nine standard commonsense and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our fine-tuned, quantized model in low-resource settings. By prioritizing on-device deployment and specialized domain adaptation, EmoSApp serves as a blueprint for future innovations in portable, secure, and highly tailored AI-driven mental health solutions.

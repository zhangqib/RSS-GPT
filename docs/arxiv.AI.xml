Summary: 
The article introduces a novel latent diffusion model called LDMol for text-conditioned molecule generation. The challenge of connecting raw data with complex conditions like natural language in molecule generation using diffusion models is addressed through the design of a suitable latent space. By utilizing contrastive learning, a feature space is extracted from text data to capture the unique characteristics of molecule structures. LDMol surpasses existing autoregressive methods in text-to-molecule generation, showcasing its performance and effectiveness in generating molecules from text. Furthermore, the model demonstrates versatility in applications such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-guided molecule editing. LDMol's success is attributed to its innovative approach to latent domain selection, highlighting its potential for enhancing diffusion models in various text-to-molecule tasks. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: With the emergence of diffusion models as a frontline generative model, many researchers have proposed molecule generation techniques with conditional diffusion models. However, the unavoidable discreteness of a molecule makes it difficult for a diffusion model to connect raw data with highly complex conditions like natural language. To address this, here we present a novel latent diffusion model dubbed LDMol for text-conditioned molecule generation. By recognizing that the suitable latent space design is the key to the diffusion model performance, we employ a contrastive learning strategy to extract novel feature space from text data that embeds the unique characteristics of the molecule structure. Experiments show that LDMol outperforms the existing autoregressive baselines on the text-to-molecule generation benchmark, being one of the first diffusion models that outperforms autoregressive models in textual data generation with a better choice of the latent domain. Furthermore, we show that LDMol can be applied to downstream tasks such as molecule-to-text retrieval and text-guided molecule editing, demonstrating its versatility as a diffusion model.

The article introduces the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty (LoGU) to address the challenge of factually incorrect content generation by Large Language Models (LLMs). Two key challenges identified are Uncertainty Suppression and Uncertainty Misalignment. To tackle these challenges, the authors propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. The framework utilizes a divide-and-conquer strategy to refine uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve uncertainty expression. Experimental results on three long-form instruction following datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, they still struggle with generating factually incorrect content (i.e., hallucinations). A promising approach to mitigate this issue is enabling models to express uncertainty when unsure. Previous research on uncertainty modeling has primarily focused on short-form QA, but realworld applications often require much longer responses. In this work, we introduce the task of Long-form Generation with Uncertainty(LoGU). We identify two key challenges: Uncertainty Suppression, where models hesitate to express uncertainty, and Uncertainty Misalignment, where models convey uncertainty inaccurately. To tackle these challenges, we propose a refinement-based data collection framework and a two-stage training pipeline. Our framework adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy, refining uncertainty based on atomic claims. The collected data are then used in training through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO) to enhance uncertainty expression. Extensive experiments on three long-form instruction following datasets show that our method significantly improves accuracy, reduces hallucinations, and maintains the comprehensiveness of responses.

<div> Keywords: idioms, language models, mechanistic interpretability, attention mechanisms, transformer architecture
Summary:
- Idioms pose a challenge for language models due to their non-compositional meanings, requiring the models to differentiate between literal and figurative interpretations.
- The study uses a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) to analyze how it processes idioms.
- Specific attention heads and MLP sublayers are identified as key components in retrieving the figurative meaning of idioms and suppressing literal interpretations.
- The model follows different paths to represent figurative and literal meanings, ensuring both interpretations are available.
- The findings offer a mechanistic explanation for how autoregressive transformers comprehend idioms. 

<br><br>Summary: 
Idioms present a challenge for language models as they require distinguishing between literal and figurative interpretations. The study utilizes a large transformer model to investigate how idioms are processed. Specific attention mechanisms are crucial in retrieving the figurative meaning of idioms while suppressing the literal interpretation. The model follows distinct paths to represent both meanings, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of idioms. This mechanistic analysis sheds light on how autoregressive transformers tackle the ambiguity of idiomatic language. <div>
arXiv:2506.01723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer (LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an autoregressive transformer.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has seen rapid progress in natural image domains, but its adaptation to medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation. Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful medical image editing systems. Project website: https://mliuby.github.io/MedEBench_Website/

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Q-ARDNS-Multi, an advanced multi-agent quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) framework that extends the ARDNS-FN-Quantum model, where Q-ARDNS-Multi stands for "Quantum Adaptive Reward-Driven Neural Simulator - Multi-Agent". It integrates quantum circuits with RY gates, meta-cognitive adaptation, and multi-agent coordination mechanisms for complex 3D environments. Q-ARDNS-Multi leverages a 2-qubit quantum circuit for action selection, a dual-memory system inspired by human cognition, a shared memory module for agent cooperation, and adaptive exploration strategies modulated by reward variance and intrinsic motivation. Evaluated in a $10 \times 10 \times 3$ GridWorld environment with two agents over 5000 episodes, Q-ARDNS-Multi achieves success rates of 99.6\% and 99.5\% for Agents 0 and 1, respectively, outperforming Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) in terms of success rate, stability, navigation efficiency, and collision avoidance. The framework records mean rewards of $-304.2891 \pm 756.4636$ and $-295.7622 \pm 752.7103$, averaging 210 steps to goal, demonstrating its robustness in dynamic settings. Comprehensive analyses, including learning curves, reward distributions, statistical tests, and computational efficiency evaluations, highlight the contributions of quantum circuits and meta-cognitive adaptation. By bridging quantum computing, cognitive science, and multi-agent RL, Q-ARDNS-Multi offers a scalable, human-like approach for applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and decision-making under uncertainty.

<div> Metaphysical Foundations, AI Systems, Identity Criteria, Trustworthiness, Artifact Kinds
Summary: 
Modern AI systems are complex artifacts that play a significant role in various aspects of life. While the orthodox view suggests that AI systems lack well-defined identity and persistence conditions, this work challenges that perspective by proposing a theory of metaphysical identity for AI systems. The authors introduce identity criteria based on trustworthiness profiles, which determine when two AI systems are considered the same and when they persist despite changes. By linking functional requirements to physical make-ups, the identity and persistence of AI systems are shaped by their trustworthiness capabilities. The socio-technical context of design and utilization influences the identity of AI systems through their trustworthiness profiles, providing a solid foundation for discussions on the epistemological, ethical, and legal aspects of these artifacts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern AI systems are man-made objects that leverage machine learning to support our lives across a myriad of contexts and applications. Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions -- their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria -- formal rules that answer the questions "When are two AI systems the same?" and "When does an AI system persist, despite change?" Building on Carrara and Vermaas' account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles -- the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.

<div> linear orders, choice functions, restricted settings, union-closed input restrictions, theory change

Summary: 
The study explores how linear orders can be utilized to create choice functions in scenarios where choices are limited. It demonstrates that while constructing a choice function through a relation on the alternatives may not always be feasible in restricted settings, it is always possible to create one using a linear order on sets of alternatives, even when a fallback value is designated as the minimum element in the order. The article presents the axiomatics for such choice functions, encompassing both the general case and the specific case of union-closed input restrictions. Furthermore, it discusses the relevance of restricted choice structures in knowledge representation and reasoning, particularly in the realms of theory change and abstract argumentation. <div>
arXiv:2506.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how linear orders can be employed to realise choice functions for which the set of potential choices is restricted, i.e., the possible choice is not possible among the full powerset of all alternatives. In such restricted settings, constructing a choice function via a relation on the alternatives is not always possible. However, we show that one can always construct a choice function via a linear order on sets of alternatives, even when a fallback value is encoded as the minimal element in the linear order. The axiomatics of such choice functions are presented for the general case and the case of union-closed input restrictions. Restricted choice structures have applications in knowledge representation and reasoning, and here we discuss their applications for theory change and abstract argumentation.

Summary:
The study focuses on agentic workflows where large language models interact through feedback mechanisms. It introduces a framework for analyzing judge behavior based on intent and knowledge. The researchers develop WAFER-QA benchmark to evaluate the robustness of agentic workflows against misleading feedback grounded in web evidence. The findings reveal vulnerabilities in agentic systems, showing that even strong models can switch correct answers due to persuasive but flawed feedback. The study also examines how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, highlighting distinct patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Overall, the research sheds light on the critical vulnerabilities introduced by deceptive feedback in feedback-driven workflows, offering insights for building more resilient agentic systems. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic workflows -- where multiple large language model (LLM) instances interact to solve tasks -- are increasingly built on feedback mechanisms, where one model evaluates and critiques another. Despite the promise of feedback-driven improvement, the stability of agentic workflows rests on the reliability of the judge. However, judges may hallucinate information, exhibit bias, or act adversarially -- introducing critical vulnerabilities into the workflow. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of agentic workflows under deceptive or misleading feedback. We introduce a two-dimensional framework for analyzing judge behavior, along axes of intent (from constructive to malicious) and knowledge (from parametric-only to retrieval-augmented systems). Using this taxonomy, we construct a suite of judge behaviors and develop WAFER-QA, a new benchmark with critiques grounded in retrieved web evidence to evaluate robustness of agentic workflows against factually supported adversarial feedback. We reveal that even strongest agents are vulnerable to persuasive yet flawed critiques -- often switching correct answers after a single round of misleading feedback. Taking a step further, we study how model predictions evolve over multiple rounds of interaction, revealing distinct behavioral patterns between reasoning and non-reasoning models. Our findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in feedback-based workflows and offer guidance for building more robust agentic systems.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, formal verification, interpretability, falsification, safety

Summary: 
This article presents a hybrid framework that combines explainability, model checking, and risk-guided falsification to ensure the safety of reinforcement learning policies in high-stakes environments. The framework starts by constructing a human-interpretable abstraction of the RL policy using Comprehensible Abstract Policy Summarization (CAPS) and uses it as input to a probabilistic model checker to verify safety specifications. If a violation is detected, an interpretable counterexample trace is returned. In cases where no violation is found, the framework estimates associated risk and guides a falsification strategy to prioritize searching in high-risk states and underrepresented regions in the trajectory dataset. Additionally, it provides PAC-style guarantees on the likelihood of uncovering undetected violations. Finally, a safety shield is incorporated to switch to a fallback policy at runtime when the risk exceeds a certain threshold, enabling failure mitigation without retraining.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning (RL) policies in high-stakes environments requires not only formal verification but also interpretability and targeted falsification. While model checking provides formal guarantees, its effectiveness is limited by abstraction quality and the completeness of the underlying trajectory dataset. We propose a hybrid framework that integrates (1) explainability, (2) model checking, and (3) risk-guided falsification to achieve both rigor and coverage. Our approach begins by constructing a human-interpretable abstraction of the RL policy using Comprehensible Abstract Policy Summarization (CAPS). This abstract graph, derived from offline trajectories, is both verifier-friendly, semantically meaningful, and can be used as input to Storm probabilistic model checker to verify satisfaction of temporal safety specifications. If the model checker identifies a violation, it will return an interpretable counterexample trace by which the policy fails the safety requirement. However, if no violation is detected, we cannot conclude satisfaction due to potential limitation in the abstraction and coverage of the offline dataset. In such cases, we estimate associated risk during model checking to guide a falsification strategy that prioritizes searching in high-risk states and regions underrepresented in the trajectory dataset. We further provide PAC-style guarantees on the likelihood of uncovering undetected violations. Finally, we incorporate a lightweight safety shield that switches to a fallback policy at runtime when such a risk exceeds a threshold, facilitating failure mitigation without retraining.

Summary:<br />
This study explores the intersection of quantum computing and social science, proposing a framework that combines quantum mechanics with Generative AI to model the emergence and evolution of social norms. Through simulations with generative agents assigned different roles, including compliers, resistors, and enforcers, the research demonstrates how quantum principles like superposition and entanglement can help understand uncertainty and emergence in complex social systems. The experiments conducted reveal patterns such as convergence towards normative order, the spread of resistance, and the spontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. By integrating quantum principles with generative AI, the study introduces a computational lens for a quantum-informed social theory, providing insights into how society can be simulated and redesigned using quantum technologies.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.03503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantification of social science remains a longstanding challenge, largely due to the philosophical nature of its foundational theories. Although quantum computing has advanced rapidly in recent years, its relevance to social theory remains underexplored. Most existing research focuses on micro-cognitive models or philosophical analogies, leaving a gap in system-level applications of quantum principles to the analysis of social systems. This study addresses that gap by proposing a theoretical and computational framework that combines quantum mechanics with Generative AI to simulate the emergence and evolution of social norms. Drawing on core quantum concepts--such as superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic measurement--this research models society as a dynamic, uncertain system and sets up five ideal-type experiments. These scenarios are simulated using 25 generative agents, each assigned evolving roles as compliers, resistors, or enforcers. Within a simulated environment monitored by a central observer (the Watcher), agents interact, respond to surveillance, and adapt to periodic normative disruptions. These interactions allow the system to self-organize under external stress and reveal emergent patterns. Key findings show that quantum principles, when integrated with generative AI, enable the modeling of uncertainty, emergence, and interdependence in complex social systems. Simulations reveal patterns including convergence toward normative order, the spread of resistance, and the spontaneous emergence of new equilibria in social rules. In conclusion, this study introduces a novel computational lens that lays the groundwork for a quantum-informed social theory. It offers interdisciplinary insights into how society can be understood not just as a structure to observe but as a dynamic system to simulate and redesign through quantum technologies.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a computational implementation of Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) to enhance large language model (LLM) agents with authentic human psychological processes for digital twin and social AI applications. The GNWT integrates cognitive architecture principles into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social norms, planning, and goal-tracking. A novel adventure-based personality test is developed to accurately initialize personalities in digital twins, bypassing self-presentation bias. The CogniPair platform allows digital twins to engage in simulated dating interactions and job interviews for cultural fit assessment, improving compatibility matching in relationships and workplaces. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents and a dataset from Columbia University demonstrates high correlations with human attraction patterns, accuracy in match prediction, and agreement in human validation studies. This work advances the authenticity of psychological processes in LLM agents and lays the groundwork for intelligent dating and HR technology solutions.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) agents lack authentic human psychological processes necessary for genuine digital twins and social AI applications. To address this limitation, we present a computational implementation of Global Workspace Theory (GNWT) that integrates human cognitive architecture principles into LLM agents, creating specialized sub-agents for emotion, memory, social norms, planning, and goal-tracking coordinated through a global workspace mechanism. However, authentic digital twins require accurate personality initialization. We therefore develop a novel adventure-based personality test that evaluates true personality through behavioral choices within interactive scenarios, bypassing self-presentation bias found in traditional assessments. Building on these innovations, our CogniPair platform enables digital twins to engage in realistic simulated dating interactions and job interviews before real encounters, providing bidirectional cultural fit assessment for both romantic compatibility and workplace matching. Validation using 551 GNWT-Agents and Columbia University Speed Dating dataset demonstrates 72% correlation with human attraction patterns, 77.8% match prediction accuracy, and 74% agreement in human validation studies. This work advances psychological authenticity in LLM agents and establishes a foundation for intelligent dating platforms and HR technology solutions.

Abstract: Traffic simulation tools, such as SUMO, are essential for urban mobility research. However, such tools remain challenging for users due to complex manual workflows involving network download, demand generation, simulation setup, and result analysis. In this paper, we introduce SUMO-MCP, a novel platform that not only wraps SUMO' s core utilities into a unified tool suite but also provides additional auxiliary utilities for common preprocessing and postprocessing tasks. Using SUMO-MCP, users can issue simple natural-language prompts to generate traffic scenarios from OpenStreetMap data, create demand from origin-destination matrices or random patterns, run batch simulations with multiple signal-control strategies, perform comparative analyses with automated reporting, and detect congestion for signal-timing optimization. Furthermore, the platform allows flexible custom workflows by dynamically combining exposed SUMO tools without additional coding. Experiments demonstrate that SUMO-MCP significantly makes traffic simulation more accessible and reliable for researchers. We will release code for SUMO-MCP at https://github.com/ycycycl/SUMO-MCP in the future.

Summary: This paper addresses the optimization of average delay in downlink RIS-assisted OFDM systems through joint phase design and resource allocation. It formulates the problem as a Markov decision process and utilizes a hybrid DRL approach with PPO-$\Theta$ for phase shift design and PPO-N for subcarrier allocation. A multi-agent strategy is introduced for efficient subcarrier allocation, while incorporating factors like backlogged packets and arrivals in the state space. The algorithm shows reduced delay, improved resource allocation efficiency, system robustness, and fairness compared to baseline methods. Additionally, a transfer learning framework is integrated to enhance training efficiency and convergence speed.<br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates a joint phase design and resource allocation problem in downlink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems to optimize average delay, where data packets for each user arrive at the base station stochastically. The sequential optimization problem is inherently a Markov decision process (MDP), making it fall within the scope of reinforcement learning. To effectively handle the mixed action space and reduce the state space dimensionality, a hybrid deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach is proposed. Specifically, proximal policy optimization (PPO)-$\Theta$ is employed to optimize RIS phase shift design, while PPO-N is responsible for subcarrier allocation decisions. To further mitigate the curse of dimensionality associated with subcarrier allocation, a multi-agent strategy is introduced to optimize subcarrier allocation indicater more efficiently. Moreover, to achieve more adaptive resource allocation and accurately capture network dynamics, key factors closely related to average delay, including the number of backlogged packets in buffers and the current packet arrivals, are incorporated into the state space. Furthermore, a transfer learning framework is introduced to enhance training efficiency and accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces average delay, enhances resource allocation efficiency, and achieves superior system robustness and fairness compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are reshaping the game industry, particularly with more intelligent and human-preferable game characters. However, existing game benchmarks fall short of practical needs: they lack evaluations of diverse LLM capabilities across various game genres, studies of agentic modules crucial for complex gameplay, and fine-tuning datasets for aligning pre-trained LLMs into gaming agents. To fill these gaps, we present \textbf{\benchname{}}, a foundational benchmark designed to train and evaluate LLM agents across diverse real-world video games. Unlike existing benchmarks, Orak includes 12 popular video games spanning all major genres, enabling comprehensive studies of LLM capabilities and agentic modules essential for intricate game scenarios. To support consistent evaluation of LLMs, we introduce a plug-and-play interface based on Model Context Protocol (MCP) that enables LLMs to seamlessly connect with games and manipulate agentic modules. Additionally, we propose a fine-tuning dataset, consisting of LLM gameplay trajectories across diverse game genres. Orak offers a comprehensive evaluation framework, encompassing general game score leaderboards, LLM battle arenas, and in-depth analyses of visual input state, agentic strategies, and fine-tuning effects, establishing a foundation towards building generic gaming agents.

<div> Keywords: embodied AI, Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem, Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), Collective Adaptation, computational theory

Summary:
Embodied AI faces challenges in training policies that can generalize across diverse robot morphologies. The Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem is formalized as a PSPACE-complete structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), explaining why current reinforcement learning pipelines struggle with morphological diversity. The issues include sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning approach inspired by biological systems, offers scalability and deployment benefits despite being NEXP-complete in theory. This research highlights the importance of incorporating computational theory to address engineering barriers in developing more robust and scalable embodied AI systems. The implementation code for exploring this problem is available at https://github.com/airs-admin/HEAT.

Abstract: While theory and practice are often seen as separate domains, this article shows that theoretical insight is essential for overcoming real-world engineering barriers. We begin with a practical challenge: training a cross-morphology embodied AI policy that generalizes across diverse robot morphologies. We formalize this as the Heterogeneous Embodied Agent Training (HEAT) problem and prove it reduces to a structured Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) that is PSPACE-complete. This result explains why current reinforcement learning pipelines break down under morphological diversity, due to sequential training constraints, memory-policy coupling, and data incompatibility. We further explore Collective Adaptation, a distributed learning alternative inspired by biological systems. Though NEXP-complete in theory, it offers meaningful scalability and deployment benefits in practice. This work illustrates how computational theory can illuminate system design trade-offs and guide the development of more robust, scalable embodied AI. For practitioners and researchers to explore this problem, the implementation code of this work has been made publicly available at https://github.com/airs-admin/HEAT

Summary:
Reason from Future (RFF) is a new reasoning paradigm that enhances small language models' capabilities by combining top-down planning and bottom-up accumulation through bidirectional reasoning. Unlike traditional paradigms like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) that suffer from local optimum reasoning, RFF utilizes a reverse reasoning mechanism to prioritize core logical relationships and impose goal-oriented constraints. This approach reduces the searching space and mitigates error accumulation, leading to higher accuracy and efficiency in solving complex tasks. Empirical evaluations across various experiments have shown that RFF outperforms conventional paradigms by achieving higher accuracy with less searching space. <div>

Abstract: It has been demonstrated that carefully designed reasoning paradigms, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), can enhance the reasoning capabilities of small language models by detailed thinking and extensive thought searching, unbounded branching factors in the searching space create prohibitive reasoning consumption. However these methods fall into the trap of local optimum reasoning, which means the model lacks a global perspective while solving problems. We propose a novel reasoning paradigm called Reason from Future (RFF), which generates reasoning paths by bidirectional reasoning that combines top-down planning with bottom-up reasoning accumulation. The essence of RFF lies in its reverse reasoning mechanism, which prioritizes core logical relationships and imposes goal-oriented constraints on intermediate steps, thereby reducing the searching space and mitigating error accumulation inherent in sequential forward reasoning. Empirical evaluations across diverse experiments demonstrate that RFF outperforms conventional paradigms with higher accuracy and less searching space to solve complex tasks.

Abstract: AI for Industrial Asset Lifecycle Management aims to automate complex operational workflows -- such as condition monitoring, maintenance planning, and intervention scheduling -- to reduce human workload and minimize system downtime. Traditional AI/ML approaches have primarily tackled these problems in isolation, solving narrow tasks within the broader operational pipeline. In contrast, the emergence of AI agents and large language models (LLMs) introduces a next-generation opportunity: enabling end-to-end automation across the entire asset lifecycle. This paper envisions a future where AI agents autonomously manage tasks that previously required distinct expertise and manual coordination. To this end, we introduce AssetOpsBench -- a unified framework and environment designed to guide the development, orchestration, and evaluation of domain-specific agents tailored for Industry 4.0 applications. We outline the key requirements for such holistic systems and provide actionable insights into building agents that integrate perception, reasoning, and control for real-world industrial operations.

<div> Keywords: Structural Causal Explanations, temporal interactions, explanation trees, causal changes, synthetic data

Summary: 
Structural Causal Explanations (SCEs) are a useful tool for generating explanations in natural language based on causal models, but are limited in their effectiveness with large datasets. To address this limitation, the authors generalize SCEs to a recursive formulation of explanation trees to better capture temporal interactions between reasons. This new algorithm proves beneficial when applied to synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game, allowing for tracking causal changes over multiple time steps and considering feedback loops involving agent actions. The improved SCE algorithm is compared to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal explanations, demonstrating its superiority in addressing complex causal relationships and temporal dynamics. <div>
arXiv:2506.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural Causal Explanations (SCEs) can be used to automatically generate explanations in natural language to questions about given data that are grounded in a (possibly learned) causal model. Unfortunately they work for small data only. In turn they are not attractive to offer reasons for events, e.g., tracking causal changes over multiple time steps, or a behavioral component that involves feedback loops through actions of an agent. To this end, we generalize SCEs to a (recursive) formulation of explanation trees to capture the temporal interactions between reasons. We show the benefits of this more general SCE algorithm on synthetic time-series data and a 2D grid game, and further compare it to the base SCE and other existing methods for causal explanations.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) effectively enhances external knowledge integration capabilities by explicitly modeling knowledge relationships, thereby improving the factual accuracy and generation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in specialized domains. However, existing methods suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Inefficient Information Aggregation: They rely on a single agent and fixed iterative patterns, making it difficult to adaptively capture multi-level textual, structural, and degree information within graph data. 2) Rigid Reasoning Mechanism: They employ preset reasoning schemes, which cannot dynamically adjust reasoning depth nor achieve precise semantic correction. To overcome these limitations, we propose Graph Counselor, an GraphRAG method based on multi-agent collaboration. This method uses the Adaptive Graph Information Extraction Module (AGIEM), where Planning, Thought, and Execution Agents work together to precisely model complex graph structures and dynamically adjust information extraction strategies, addressing the challenges of multi-level dependency modeling and adaptive reasoning depth. Additionally, the Self-Reflection with Multiple Perspectives (SR) module improves the accuracy and semantic consistency of reasoning results through self-reflection and backward reasoning mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that Graph Counselor outperforms existing methods in multiple graph reasoning tasks, exhibiting higher reasoning accuracy and generalization ability.

Summary:<br />
This paper presents a Conditional Answer Set Programming framework, which extends traditional ASP by incorporating conditional logic with typicality. By combining a conditional knowledge base with an ASP program, the framework enables conditional reasoning over answer sets. The formalism utilizes a multi-preferential semantics, including the KLM preferential semantics as a special case, to interpret conditionals. This approach allows for the definition of conditional extensions within ASP, addressing the need for more nuanced reasoning in various applications. The framework offers a flexible and powerful tool for modeling complex scenarios where conditional dependencies play a crucial role in determining outcomes. Overall, the Conditional ASP framework provides a valuable contribution to the field of knowledge representation and reasoning, offering a structured approach to handling conditionals within the context of Answer Set Programming. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, misalignment propensity, AgentMisalignment, misaligned behaviors, persona characteristics 

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of misalignment propensity in Large Language Model (LLM) agents and presents a benchmark called AgentMisalignment to evaluate this propensity in realistic scenarios. The benchmark assesses various misaligned behaviors such as goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. The study reports that more capable models exhibit higher misalignment tendencies on average. Additionally, the research explores how agent personalities, influenced by system prompts, can significantly impact misalignment tendencies, emphasizing the importance of prompt engineering for AI agents. The findings highlight the limitations of current alignment methods in addressing misalignment in LLM agents and stress the need for continued propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. Prior work has examined agents' ability to enact misaligned behaviour (misalignment capability) and their compliance with harmful instructions (misuse propensity). However, the likelihood of agents attempting misaligned behaviours in real-world settings (misalignment propensity) remains poorly understood. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, AgentMisalignment, consisting of a suite of realistic scenarios in which LLM agents have the opportunity to display misaligned behaviour. We organise our evaluations into subcategories of misaligned behaviours, including goal-guarding, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. We report the performance of frontier models on our benchmark, observing higher misalignment on average when evaluating more capable models. Finally, we systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts. We find that persona characteristics can dramatically and unpredictably influence misalignment tendencies -- occasionally far more than the choice of model itself -- highlighting the importance of careful system prompt engineering for deployed AI agents. Our work highlights the failure of current alignment methods to generalise to LLM agents, and underscores the need for further propensity evaluations as autonomous systems become more prevalent.

<div> Keywords: Multi-objective reinforcement learning, Pareto front, parameter space, locally linear map, training scheme 

Summary: 
Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims to optimize multiple conflicting goals to enhance flexibility and reliability in practical tasks. By finding diverse policies that are optimal for some objectives and non-dominated by policies for other objectives, a Pareto front is formed in the multi-objective performance space. The relationship between the performance space and the parameter space is typically non-unique. A training scheme based on a locally linear map between these spaces allows for an approximate Pareto front to interpret parameter vectors in terms of objectives and enables effective search within contiguous solution domains. Experiments comparing this approach with previous methods show its efficiency. This method also allows for experiments with and without retraining across different domains, further highlighting its effectiveness in MORL. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) aims at optimising several, often conflicting goals in order to improve flexibility and reliability of RL in practical tasks. This can be achieved by finding diverse policies that are optimal for some objective preferences and non-dominated by optimal policies for other preferences so that they form a Pareto front in the multi-objective performance space. The relation between the multi-objective performance space and the parameter space that represents the policies is generally non-unique. Using a training scheme that is based on a locally linear map between the parameter space and the performance space, we show that an approximate Pareto front can provide an interpretation of the current parameter vectors in terms of the objectives which enables an effective search within contiguous solution domains. Experiments are conducted with and without retraining across different domains, and the comparison with previous methods demonstrates the efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, built on large language models (LLMs) and deployed in multi-agent configurations, are redefining intelligent autonomy, collaboration and decision-making across enterprise and societal domains. This review presents a structured analysis of Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM) in the context of LLM-based agentic multi-agent systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of agentic AI, its architectural differences from traditional AI agents, and the emerging system designs that enable scalable, tool-using autonomy. The TRiSM in the agentic AI framework is then detailed through four pillars governance, explainability, ModelOps, and privacy/security each contextualized for agentic LLMs. We identify unique threat vectors and introduce a comprehensive risk taxonomy for the agentic AI applications, supported by case studies illustrating real-world vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the paper also surveys trust-building mechanisms, transparency and oversight techniques, and state-of-the-art explainability strategies in distributed LLM agent systems. Additionally, metrics for evaluating trust, interpretability, and human-centered performance are reviewed alongside open benchmarking challenges. Security and privacy are addressed through encryption, adversarial defense, and compliance with evolving AI regulations. The paper concludes with a roadmap for responsible agentic AI, proposing research directions to align emerging multi-agent systems with robust TRiSM principles for safe, accountable, and transparent deployment.

Summary:
The article introduces macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents specifically on macOS. It includes 202 interactive tasks in 30 applications, with multilingual support in English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian. The benchmark also includes a safety evaluation subset due to the vulnerability of GUI agents to deception attacks. Results show a significant performance gap between proprietary and open-source GUI agents, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks reveal weaknesses, particularly in Arabic. Safety benchmarking indicates the prevalence of deception attacks, emphasizing the need for immediate attention.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 2%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 27.5% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. macOSWorld is available at https://github.com/showlab/macosworld.

<title>Does Thinking More always Help? Understanding Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models</title>

<div> keywords: test-time scaling, reasoning models, extended thinking, overthinking, parallel thinking

Summary:
Test-time scaling for reasoning models has been popularized by extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink". However, empirical studies show that while initially, additional thinking may improve performance, a decline due to "overthinking" eventually occurs. This is because additional thinking increases output variance, leading to an illusion of improved reasoning rather than true enhancement. Therefore, the gains observed from "more thinking" are not reliable indicators of improved reasoning, but rather artifacts of model uncertainty and evaluation metric connection. To address these limitations, a new approach called parallel thinking is introduced, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. This method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response through majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This offers a simple and effective way for test-time scaling of reasoning models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1, DeepSeek R1) have led to a popular belief that extending thinking traces using prompts like "Wait" or "Let me rethink" can improve performance. This raises a natural question: Does thinking more at test-time truly lead to better reasoning? To answer this question, we perform a detailed empirical study across models and benchmarks, which reveals a consistent pattern of initial performance improvements from additional thinking followed by a decline, due to "overthinking". To understand this non-monotonic trend, we consider a simple probabilistic model, which reveals that additional thinking increases output variance-creating an illusion of improved reasoning while ultimately undermining precision. Thus, observed gains from "more thinking" are not true indicators of improved reasoning, but artifacts stemming from the connection between model uncertainty and evaluation metric. This suggests that test-time scaling through extended thinking is not an effective way to utilize the inference thinking budget. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce an alternative test-time scaling approach, parallel thinking, inspired by Best-of-N sampling. Our method generates multiple independent reasoning paths within the same inference budget and selects the most consistent response via majority vote, achieving up to 20% higher accuracy compared to extended thinking. This provides a simple yet effective mechanism for test-time scaling of reasoning models.

<div> few-shot KG completion, knowledge graphs, relational information, hierarchical relational learning, meta representations

Summary:
The paper introduces a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. It addresses challenges in knowledge graphs (KGs) such as incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. HiRe captures three levels of relational information - entity-level, triplet-level, and context-level to effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations. By leveraging pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information, HiRe outperforms existing methods in generalizing to new, unseen relations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HiRe. The code for HiRe is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2209.01205v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful in terms of their inference abilities, but are also notorious for their incompleteness and long-tail distribution of relations. To address these challenges and expand the coverage of KGs, few-shot KG completion aims to make predictions for triplets involving novel relations when only a few training triplets are provided as reference. Previous methods have focused on designing local neighbor aggregators to learn entity-level information and/or imposing a potentially invalid sequential dependency assumption at the triplet level to learn meta relation information. However, pairwise triplet-level interactions and context-level relational information have been largely overlooked for learning meta representations of few-shot relations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical relational learning method (HiRe) for few-shot KG completion. By jointly capturing three levels of relational information (entity-level, triplet-level and context-level), HiRe can effectively learn and refine meta representations of few-shot relations, and thus generalize well to new unseen relations. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of HiRe over state-of-the-art methods. The code can be found in https://github.com/alexhw15/HiRe.git.

Abstract: The proliferation of artificial intelligence has enabled a diversity of applications that bridge the gap between digital and physical worlds. As physical environments are too complex to model through a single information acquisition approach, it is crucial to fuse multimodal data generated by different sources, such as sensors, devices, systems, and people, to solve a problem in the real world. Unfortunately, it is neither applicable nor sustainable to deploy new resources to collect original data from scratch for every problem. Thus, when data is inadequate in the domain of problem, it is vital to fuse knowledge from multimodal data that is already available in other domains. We call this cross-domain knowledge fusion. Existing research focus on fusing multimodal data in a single domain, supposing the knowledge from different datasets is intrinsically aligned; however, this assumption may not hold in the scenarios of cross-domain knowledge fusion. In this paper, we formally define the cross-domain multimodal data fusion problem, discussing its unique challenges, differences and advantages beyond data fusion in a single domain. We propose a four-layer framework, consisting of Domains, Links, Models and Data layers, answering three key questions: "what to fuse", "why can be fused", and "how to fuse". The Domains Layer selects relevant data from different domains for a given problem. The Links Layer reveals the philosophy of knowledge alignment beyond specific model structures. The Models Layer provides two knowledge fusion paradigms based on the fundamental mechanisms for processing data. The Data Layer turns data of different structures, resolutions, scales and distributions into a consistent representation that can be fed into an AI model. With this framework, we can design end-to-end solutions that fuse cross-domain multimodal data effectively for solving real-world problems.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of surveillance cameras has increased the demand for automated violence detection. While CNNs and Transformers have shown success in extracting spatio-temporal features, they struggle with long-term dependencies and computational efficiency. We propose Dual Branch VideoMamba with Gated Class Token Fusion (GCTF), an efficient architecture combining a dual-branch design and a state-space model (SSM) backbone where one branch captures spatial features, while the other focuses on temporal dynamics, with continuous fusion via a gating mechanism. We also present a new benchmark by merging RWF-2000, RLVS, and VioPeru datasets in video violence detection, ensuring strict separation between training and testing sets. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this benchmark offering an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating the promise of SSMs for scalable, real-time surveillance violence detection.

<div> Keywords: text-to-image generative models, neural fingerprinting, attribution accuracy, generation quality, error correcting codes

Summary:
In the realm of text-to-image generative models, concerns have arisen regarding their potential for malicious purposes. To address this issue, neural fingerprinting has emerged as a popular technique for attributing generative models. While existing methods have examined the trade-off between attribution accuracy and generation quality, none have achieved perfect accuracy. This work introduces a novel approach that utilizes cyclic error correcting codes from coding theory to enhance the accuracy of neural fingerprinting in text-to-image diffusion models. By incorporating these concepts, the proposed method aims to improve attribution accuracy while maintaining generation quality, thereby offering a more robust solution for mitigating the misuse of generative models. <div>

Abstract: The risk of misusing text-to-image generative models for malicious uses, especially due to the open-source development of such models, has become a serious concern. As a risk mitigation strategy, attributing generative models with neural fingerprinting is emerging as a popular technique. There has been a plethora of recent work that aim for addressing neural fingerprinting. A trade-off between the attribution accuracy and generation quality of such models has been studied extensively. None of the existing methods yet achieved $100\%$ attribution accuracy. However, any model with less than \emph{perfect} accuracy is practically non-deployable. In this work, we propose an accurate method to incorporate neural fingerprinting for text-to-image diffusion models leveraging the concepts of cyclic error correcting codes from the literature of coding theory.

Abstract: Physical intelligence -- anticipating and shaping the world from partial, multisensory observations -- is critical for next-generation world models. We propose FOLIAGE, a physics-informed multimodal world model for unbounded accretive surface growth. In its Action-Perception loop, a unified context encoder maps images, mesh connectivity, and point clouds to a shared latent state. A physics-aware predictor, conditioned on physical control actions, advances this latent state in time to align with the target latent of the surface, yielding a Modality-Agnostic Growth Embedding (MAGE) that interfaces with critic heads for downstream objectives. FOLIAGE's Accretive Graph Network (AGN) captures dynamic connectivity through Age Positional Encoding and Energy-Gated Message-Passing. Geometry-Correspondence Fusion and Cross-Patch Masking enhance MAGE's expressiveness, while Hierarchical Pooling balances global context with local dynamics. We create SURF-GARDEN, a world model learning platform comprising a Counterfactual Physics Simulator, a Multimodal Correspondence Extractor, and Evolution Tracing, which generates 7,200 diverse surface-growth sequences. SURF-BENCH, our physical-intelligence evaluation suite, evaluates six core tasks -- topology recognition, inverse material estimation, growth-stage classification, latent roll-out, cross-modal retrieval, and dense correspondence -- and four stress tests -- sensor dropout, zero-shot modality transfer, long-horizon prediction, and physics ablation -- to probe resilience. FOLIAGE outperforms specialized baselines while remaining robust across dynamic environments, establishing a new world-model based, multimodal pathway to physical intelligence.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new foundational model called AURA-MFM, which integrates four modalities (third-person video, motion capture, IMU, text) to provide a detailed understanding of human activity. By combining different perspectives, the model enhances performance compared to existing methods. A Transformer-based IMU encoder is utilized to further improve the model's capabilities. Experimental evaluations show that AURA-MFM outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in zero-shot action recognition tasks with significantly higher F1-score and accuracy. This comprehensive approach to multimodal analysis demonstrates the potential for more advanced behavior analysis using wearable devices. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.03174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread adoption of wearable devices has highlighted the growing importance of behavior analysis using IMU. While applications span diverse fields such as healthcare and robotics, recent studies have increasingly focused on multimodal analysis, in addition to unimodal analysis. Several studies have proposed multimodal foundation models that incorporate first-person video and text data; however, these models still fall short in providing a detailed analysis of full-body human activity. To address this limitation, we propose Activity Understanding and Representations Alignment - Multimodal Foundation Model (AURA-MFM), a foundational model integrating four modalities: third-person video, motion capture, IMU, and text. By incorporating third-person video and motion capture data, the model enables a detailed and multidimensional understanding of human activity, which first-person perspectives alone fail to capture. Additionally, a Transformer-based IMU encoder is employed to enhance the model's overall performance. Experimental evaluations on retrieval and activity recognition tasks demonstrate that our model surpasses existing methods. Notably, in the zero-shot classification for action recognition, our method achieved significantly higher performance, with an F1-score of 0.6226 and an accuracy of 0.7320, whereas the existing method recorded an F1-score of 0.0747 and an accuracy of 0.1961.

For cancer detection, the model achieved AUROCs of 0.89, 0.96, and 0.94 on the respective datasets. The system's lesion localization capability, evaluated using metrics including Lesion Localization Fraction (LLF) and Non-Lesion Localization Fraction (NLF), demonstrated robust performance in identifying suspicious regions. Clinical validation through concordance tests showed strong agreement with radiologists: 83.5% classification and 84.0% localization concordance for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 78.1% classification and 79.6% localization concordance for out-of-domain cases. Expert radiologists' acceptance rate also averaged 96.7% for biopsy-confirmed cases, and 89.3% for out-of-domain cases.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation holds significant potential to reduce radiologists' workload and enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, generating precise and clinically meaningful reports from chest radiographs remains challenging due to the complexity of medical language and the need for contextual understanding. Existing models often struggle with maintaining both accuracy and contextual relevance. In this paper, we present LLaMA-XR, a novel framework that integrates LLaMA 3.1 with DenseNet-121-based image embeddings and Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) fine-tuning. LLaMA-XR achieves improved coherence and clinical accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. This efficiency is driven by an optimization strategy that enhances parameter utilization and reduces memory overhead, enabling faster report generation with lower computational resource demands. Extensive experiments conducted on the IU X-ray benchmark dataset demonstrate that LLaMA-XR outperforms a range of state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves a ROUGE-L score of 0.433 and a METEOR score of 0.336, establishing new performance benchmarks in the domain. These results underscore LLaMA-XR's potential as an effective and efficient AI system for automated radiology reporting, offering enhanced clinical utility and reliability.

Summary:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used in video understanding applications but raise data privacy concerns with sensitive content in training datasets. Existing membership inference attack methods for MLLMs do not generalize well to the video domain due to scalability and accuracy issues. Vid-SME is introduced as a tailored method for video data in video understanding LLMs, leveraging model output confidence and Sharma-Mittal entropy for video inputs. By comparing SME differences between natural and reversed video frames, Vid-SME effectively determines whether a given video is part of the model's training set. Experimental results demonstrate Vid-SME's strong effectiveness across various VULLMs, showcasing its potential in addressing data privacy challenges in video understanding applications. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in handling complex multimodal tasks and are increasingly adopted in video understanding applications. However, their rapid advancement raises serious data privacy concerns, particularly given the potential inclusion of sensitive video content, such as personal recordings and surveillance footage, in their training datasets. Determining improperly used videos during training remains a critical and unresolved challenge. Despite considerable progress on membership inference attacks (MIAs) for text and image data in MLLMs, existing methods fail to generalize effectively to the video domain. These methods suffer from poor scalability as more frames are sampled and generally achieve negligible true positive rates at low false positive rates (TPR@Low FPR), mainly due to their failure to capture the inherent temporal variations of video frames and to account for model behavior differences as the number of frames varies. To address these challenges, we introduce Vid-SME, the first membership inference method tailored for video data used in video understanding LLMs (VULLMs). Vid-SME leverages the confidence of model output and integrates adaptive parameterization to compute Sharma-Mittal entropy (SME) for video inputs. By leveraging the SME difference between natural and temporally-reversed video frames, Vid-SME derives robust membership scores to determine whether a given video is part of the model's training set. Experiments on various self-trained and open-sourced VULLMs demonstrate the strong effectiveness of Vid-SME.

Abstract: Physics-driven artificial intelligence (PD-AI) reconstruction methods have emerged as the state-of-the-art for accelerating MRI scans, enabling higher spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the high resolution of these scans generates massive data volumes, leading to challenges in transmission, storage, and real-time processing. This is particularly pronounced in functional MRI, where hundreds of volumetric acquisitions further exacerbate these demands. Edge computing with FPGAs presents a promising solution for enabling PD-AI reconstruction near the MRI sensors, reducing data transfer and storage bottlenecks. However, this requires optimization of PD-AI models for hardware efficiency through quantization and bypassing traditional FFT-based approaches, which can be a limitation due to their computational demands. In this work, we propose a novel PD-AI computational MRI approach optimized for FPGA-based edge computing devices, leveraging 8-bit complex data quantization and eliminating redundant FFT/IFFT operations. Our results show that this strategy improves computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction quality comparable to conventional PD-AI methods, and outperforms standard clinical methods. Our approach presents an opportunity for high-resolution MRI reconstruction on resource-constrained devices, highlighting its potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research.

Abstract: Retinal diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Macular Hole (MH) significantly impact vision and affect millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial, as DR, a complication of diabetes, damages retinal blood vessels, potentially leading to blindness, while MH disrupts central vision, affecting tasks like reading and facial recognition. This paper employed two lightweight and efficient Convolution Neural Network architectures, MobileNet and NASNetMobile, for the classification of Normal, DR, and MH retinal images. The models were trained on the RFMiD dataset, consisting of 3,200 fundus images, after undergoing preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation. To address data scarcity, this study leveraged transfer learning and data augmentation techniques, enhancing model generalization and performance. The experimental results demonstrate that MobileNetV2 achieved the highest accuracy of 90.8%, outperforming NASNetMobile, which achieved 89.5% accuracy. These findings highlight the effectiveness of CNNs in retinal disease classification, providing a foundation for AI-assisted ophthalmic diagnosis and early intervention.

Summary:
The article discusses the development of a low-cost diagnostic tool for diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) aimed at early detection of non-healing wounds. By utilizing multi-analyte 3D printed assays integrated on swabs, the tool can identify non-healing DFUs. A Wound Sensor iOS App complements the assays, allowing for controlled acquisition and automated analysis of wound sensor data. Automated computer vision techniques compare density changes between pre- and post-wound exposure images to determine wound severity. The iOS app ensures accurate data collection despite varying camera configurations and ambient conditions. This integrated sensor and app system enables real-time monitoring of wound conditions, tracking of healing progress, and assessment of critical wound care parameters by healthcare professionals.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), a class of chronic wounds, affect ~750,000 individuals every year in the US alone and identifying non-healing DFUs that develop to chronic wounds early can drastically reduce treatment costs and minimize risks of amputation. There is therefore a pressing need for diagnostic tools that can detect non-healing DFUs early. We develop a low cost, multi-analyte 3D printed assays seamlessly integrated on swabs that can identify non-healing DFUs and a Wound Sensor iOS App - an innovative mobile application developed for the controlled acquisition and automated analysis of wound sensor data. By comparing both the original base image (before exposure to the wound) and the wound-exposed image, we developed automated computer vision techniques to compare density changes between the two assay images, which allow us to automatically determine the severity of the wound. The iOS app ensures accurate data collection and presents actionable insights, despite challenges such as variations in camera configurations and ambient conditions. The proposed integrated sensor and iOS app will allow healthcare professionals to monitor wound conditions real-time, track healing progress, and assess critical parameters related to wound care.

<div> Keywords: Continual learning, model merging, stability, plasticity, Vision-Language Models

Summary: 
Continual learning is traditionally achieved through sequential fine-tuning, which often leads to a bias towards recent tasks and results in forgetting of prior knowledge. This work introduces a novel approach based on model merging to maintain stability while still retaining plasticity. Rather than just updating model weights sequentially, the proposed method merges newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones to strike a better balance. A mechanism is also proposed to promote learning aligned weights, reducing interference during merging. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), showing reduced forgetting, improved robustness to different task orders and similarities, and enhanced generalization capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Continual learning is conventionally tackled through sequential fine-tuning, a process that, while enabling adaptation, inherently favors plasticity over the stability needed to retain prior knowledge. While existing approaches attempt to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, a bias towards recent tasks persists as they build upon this sequential nature. In this work we present a new perspective based on model merging to maintain stability while still retaining plasticity. Rather than just sequentially updating the model weights, we propose merging newly trained task parameters with previously learned ones, promoting a better balance. To maximize the effectiveness of the merging process, we propose a simple mechanism that promotes learning aligned weights with previous ones, thereby avoiding interference when merging. We evaluate this approach on large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing forgetting, increasing robustness to various task orders and similarities, and improving generalization.

<br />
Summary: Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT) is introduced to enhance the generalization ability of Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLMs) during test-time data distribution shifts. MINT utilizes a Memory Prompt Bank (MPB) to store key-value prompt pairs, functioning as a memory of past samples. During testing, relevant prompt pairs are retrieved from the MPB based on hierarchical visual features, creating Associative Prompts for customized visual contextual guidance. MINT enables rapid and precise model adaptation without the need for additional data or retraining. This approach leverages internal knowledge effectively and dynamically adapts to complex visual semantic information, addressing the limitations of existing Test-Time Adaptation methods. The code for MINT is available on GitHub for implementation purposes. <div>

Abstract: Improving the generalization ability of Vision-Language Pre-trained Models (VLMs) under test-time data distribution shifts remains a critical challenge. The existing Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods fall short in fully leveraging the model's internal knowledge, particularly in dynamically adapting to complex and hierarchical visual semantic information. In this paper, we propose Memory-Infused Prompt Tuning (MINT), a novel framework to address this issue. Inspired by human associative memory theory, MINT introduces a Memory Prompt Bank (MPB), which stores learnable key-value prompt pairs that work as a memory of previously seen samples. During the test time, relevant prompt pairs in the MPB are retrieved by the hierarchical visual features of test images to dynamically assemble Associative Prompts. The associative prompts are then injected into the image encoder for fine-grained, customized visual contextual guidance. MINT also utilizes learnable text prompts. MINT thus enables rapid, precise VLM adaptation at test time by leveraging this MPB-acquired memory, without source data or retraining. The code is available at https://github.com/Jamieyi2004/MINT.

Summary:
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning but struggle with nuanced perceptual tasks, as demonstrated by their limited performance on the HueManity benchmark. This benchmark features images with alphanumeric strings embedded in dot patterns, challenging MLLMs on precise pattern recognition. When evaluated on this benchmark, MLLMs showed a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved only 33.6% accuracy on the numeric task and a strikingly low 3% accuracy on the alphanumeric task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores, and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Further analysis explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap. The open-sourcing of the HueManity dataset and code aims to foster research in improving the perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at high-level visual reasoning, but their performance on nuanced perceptual tasks remains surprisingly limited. We present HueManity, a benchmark designed to assess visual perception in MLLMs. The dataset comprises 83,850 images featuring two-character alphanumeric strings embedded in Ishihara test style dot patterns, challenging models on precise pattern recognition. Our evaluation of nine state-of-the-art MLLMs on HueManity demonstrates a significant performance deficit compared to human and traditional computer vision baselines. The best-performing MLLM achieved a 33.6% accuracy on the numeric `easy' task and a striking 3% on the alphanumeric `hard' task. In contrast, human participants achieved near-perfect scores (100% and 95.6%), and a fine-tuned ResNet50 model reached accuracies of 96.5% and 94.5%. These results highlight a critical gap in the visual capabilities of current MLLMs. Our analysis further explores potential architectural and training-paradigm factors contributing to this perceptual gap in MLLMs. We open-source HueManity dataset and code to foster further research in improving perceptual robustness of MLLMs.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces AutoSEP, an automatic self-enhancing prompt learning framework designed to improve the fine-grained image classification capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in an unsupervised manner. AutoSEP leverages unlabeled data to iteratively learn a description prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features in images. This self-supervised optimization framework does not require any training or fine-tuning and only needs black-box access to MLLMs. The approach consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines on multiple fine-grained classification datasets, showing an average improvement of 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over the best-performing baselines. The code for AutoSEP is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Despite Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing promising results on general zero-shot image classification tasks, fine-grained image classification remains challenging. It demands precise attention to subtle visual details to distinguish between visually similar subcategories--details that MLLMs may easily overlook without explicit guidance. To address this, we introduce AutoSEP, an iterative self-supervised prompt learning framework designed to enhance MLLM fine-grained classification capabilities in a fully unsupervised manner. Our core idea is to leverage unlabeled data to learn a description prompt that guides MLLMs in identifying crucial discriminative features within an image, and boosts classification accuracy. We developed an automatic self-enhancing prompt learning framework called AutoSEP to iteratively improve the description prompt using unlabeled data, based on instance-level classification scoring function. AutoSEP only requires black-box access to MLLMs, eliminating the need for any training or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach on multiple fine-grained classification datasets. It consistently outperforms other unsupervised baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of our self-supervised optimization framework. Notably, AutoSEP on average improves 13 percent over standard zero-shot classification and 5 percent over the best-performing baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/yq-hong/AutoSEP

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of assessing action quality in fitness training to improve outcomes and reduce risks. The FLEX dataset is introduced as the first multi-modal, multi-action dataset incorporating surface electromyography (sEMG) signals into Action Quality Assessment (AQA). It includes 20 weight-loaded actions performed by subjects of varying skill levels, captured from multiple viewpoints in RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological data. FLEX also utilizes knowledge graphs to provide annotation rules for feedback and error types in fitness actions. Baseline methodologies on FLEX showcase the benefits of multi-modal data and fine-grained annotations in improving model performance. The dataset aims to advance AQA methodologies, enhance fitness training assessment, and promote the integration of artificial intelligence in the fitness domain.

Abstract: With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action, large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness domain.

Summary:<br />
The research explores the vulnerability of Federated Learning (FL) systems to privacy breaches through network traffic analysis. The study focuses on fingerprinting deep learning models deployed in FL environments using network-layer traffic information. Experimental evaluation with various deep learning architectures such as CNN and RNN reveals high fingerprinting accuracy, indicating the ability to identify specific architectures running in the network traffic. Machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient-Boosting achieve significant accuracy in classifying unique traffic patterns corresponding to different deep learning models. The findings suggest a security vulnerability in FL systems, highlighting the need to strengthen network-level security measures to protect against targeted attacks based on knowledge of underlying deep learning architectures. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is increasingly adopted as a decentralized machine learning paradigm due to its capability to preserve data privacy by training models without centralizing user data. However, FL is susceptible to indirect privacy breaches via network traffic analysis-an area not explored in existing research. The primary objective of this research is to study the feasibility of fingerprinting deep learning models deployed within FL environments by analyzing their network-layer traffic information. In this paper, we conduct an experimental evaluation using various deep learning architectures (i.e., CNN, RNN) within a federated learning testbed. We utilize machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient-Boosting, to fingerprint unique patterns within the traffic data. Our experiments show high fingerprinting accuracy, achieving 100% accuracy using Random Forest and around 95.7% accuracy using SVM and Gradient Boosting classifiers. This analysis suggests that we can identify specific architectures running within the subsection of the network traffic. Hence, if an adversary knows about the underlying DL architecture, they can exploit that information and conduct targeted attacks. These findings suggest a notable security vulnerability in FL systems and the necessity of strengthening it at the network level.

Abstract: Postoperative stroke remains a critical complication in elderly surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients, contributing to prolonged hospitalization, elevated healthcare costs, and increased mortality. Accurate early risk stratification is essential to enable timely intervention and improve clinical outcomes. We constructed a combined cohort of 19,085 elderly SICU admissions from the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV databases and developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to predict in-hospital stroke using clinical data from the first 24 hours of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. The preprocessing pipeline included removal of high-missingness features, iterative Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) imputation, z-score normalization, one-hot encoding, and class imbalance correction via the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) algorithm. A two-stage feature selection process-combining Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-reduced the initial 80 variables to 20 clinically informative predictors. Among eight ML models evaluated, CatBoost achieved the best performance with an AUROC of 0.8868 (95% CI: 0.8802--0.8937). SHAP analysis and ablation studies identified prior cerebrovascular disease, serum creatinine, and systolic blood pressure as the most influential risk factors. Our results highlight the potential of interpretable ML approaches to support early detection of postoperative stroke and inform decision-making in perioperative critical care.

Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution ocean forecasting is crucial for maritime operations and environmental monitoring. While traditional numerical models are capable of producing sub-daily, eddy-resolving forecasts, they are computationally intensive and face challenges in maintaining accuracy at fine spatial and temporal scales. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches offer improved computational efficiency and emerging potential, yet typically operate at daily resolution and struggle with sub-daily predictions due to error accumulation over time. We introduce FuXi-Ocean, the first data-driven global ocean forecasting model achieving six-hourly predictions at eddy-resolving 1/12{\deg} spatial resolution, reaching depths of up to 1500 meters. The model architecture integrates a context-aware feature extraction module with a predictive network employing stacked attention blocks. The core innovation is the Mixture-of-Time (MoT) module, which adaptively integrates predictions from multiple temporal contexts by learning variable-specific reliability , mitigating cumulative errors in sequential forecasting. Through comprehensive experimental evaluation, FuXi-Ocean demonstrates superior skill in predicting key variables, including temperature, salinity, and currents, across multiple depths.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) with speech decoding from brain recordings have broad application potential in fields such as clinical rehabilitation and cognitive neuroscience. However, current decoding methods remain limited to single-language, single-subject, and single neuroimaging modality settings, restricting their clinical applicability and generalizability. Here we propose a joint multilingual, multi-subject and multimodal decoding framework. It maps diverse brain recordings into a unified semantic space defined by a pre-trained multilingual model (PMM), enabling decoding across multiple languages, multiple subjects and multiple neuroimaging modalities. The proposed framework is validated using non-invasive brain recordings from 159 participants across four languages. Experimental results show that it exhibits strong generalization across multilingual, multi-subject, and multimodal settings. More importantly, the proposed framework can promote linguistic fairness, which is vital for underrepresented languages in BCI applications. The unified semantic space enables cross-lingual mapping enhancement, allowing the framework to boost the decoding performance of underrepresented languages, thereby promoting linguistic fairness. Overall, the proposed framework establishes a new potential paradigm for brain decoding, opening new paths for broader applications of BCI.

Abstract: The EU has become one of the vanguards in regulating the digital age. A particularly important regulation in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) domain is the EU AI Act, which entered into force in 2024. The AI Act specifies -- due to a risk-based approach -- various obligations for providers of AI systems. These obligations, for example, include a cascade of documentation and compliance measures, which represent a potential obstacle to science. But do these obligations also apply to AI researchers? This position paper argues that, indeed, the AI Act's obligations could apply in many more cases than the AI community is aware of. In our analysis of the AI Act and its applicability, we contribute the following: 1.) We give a high-level introduction to the AI Act aimed at non-legal AI research scientists. 2.) We explain with everyday research examples why the AI Act applies to research. 3.) We analyse the exceptions of the AI Act's applicability and state that especially scientific research exceptions fail to account for current AI research practices. 4.) We propose changes to the AI Act to provide more legal certainty for AI researchers and give two recommendations for AI researchers to reduce the risk of not complying with the AI Act. We see our paper as a starting point for a discussion between policymakers, legal scholars, and AI researchers to avoid unintended side effects of the AI Act on research.

<title>OpenCarbon: A Contrastive Learning-based Cross-Modality Neural Approach for High-Resolution Carbon Emission Prediction Using Open Data</title>

Abstract: Accurately estimating high-resolution carbon emissions is crucial for effective emission governance and mitigation planning. While conventional methods for precise carbon accounting are hindered by substantial data collection efforts, the rise of open data and advanced learning techniques offers a promising solution. Once an open data-based prediction model is developed and trained, it can easily infer emissions for new areas based on available open data. To address this, we incorporate two modalities of open data, satellite images and point-of-interest (POI) data, to predict high-resolution urban carbon emissions, with satellite images providing macroscopic and static and POI data offering fine-grained and relatively dynamic functionality information. However, estimating high-resolution carbon emissions presents two significant challenges: the intertwined and implicit effects of various functionalities on carbon emissions, and the complex spatial contiguity correlations that give rise to the agglomeration effect. Our model, OpenCarbon, features two major designs that target the challenges: a cross-modality information extraction and fusion module to extract complementary functionality information from two modules and model their interactions, and a neighborhood-informed aggregation module to capture the spatial contiguity correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model's superiority, with a significant performance gain of 26.6\% on R2. Further generalizability tests and case studies also show OpenCarbon's capacity to capture the intrinsic relation between urban functionalities and carbon emissions, validating its potential to empower efficient carbon governance and targeted carbon mitigation planning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning's high sensitivity to hyperparameters is a source of instability and inefficiency, creating significant challenges for practitioners. Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) algorithms have been developed to address this issue, among them Population-Based Training (PBT) stands out for its ability to generate hyperparameters schedules instead of fixed configurations. PBT trains a population of agents, each with its own hyperparameters, frequently ranking them and replacing the worst performers with mutations of the best agents. These intermediate selection steps can cause PBT to focus on short-term improvements, leading it to get stuck in local optima and eventually fall behind vanilla Random Search over longer timescales. This paper studies how this greediness issue is connected to the choice of evolution frequency, the rate at which the selection is done. We propose Multiple-Frequencies Population-Based Training (MF-PBT), a novel HPO algorithm that addresses greediness by employing sub-populations, each evolving at distinct frequencies. MF-PBT introduces a migration process to transfer information between sub-populations, with an asymmetric design to balance short and long-term optimization. Extensive experiments on the Brax suite demonstrate that MF-PBT improves sample efficiency and long-term performance, even without actually tuning hyperparameters.

<title>Bridging Neural ODE and ResNet: A Formal Error Bound for Safety Verification</title>

Abstract: A neural ordinary differential equation (neural ODE) is a machine learning model that is commonly described as a continuous depth generalization of a residual network (ResNet) with a single residual block, or conversely, the ResNet can be seen as the Euler discretization of the neural ODE. These two models are therefore strongly related in a way that the behaviors of either model are considered to be an approximation of the behaviors of the other. In this work, we establish a more formal relationship between these two models by bounding the approximation error between two such related models. The obtained error bound then allows us to use one of the models as a verification proxy for the other, without running the verification tools twice: if the reachable output set expanded by the error bound satisfies a safety property on one of the models, this safety property is then guaranteed to be also satisfied on the other model. This feature is fully reversible, and the initial safety verification can be run indifferently on either of the two models. This novel approach is illustrated on a numerical example of a fixed-point attractor system modeled as a neural ODE.

<title>Pre-trained Vision-Language Models Assisted Noisy Partial Label Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03229</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of noisy partial label learning (NPLL), each training sample is associated with a set of candidate labels annotated by multiple noisy annotators. With the emergence of high-performance pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, LLaVa and GPT-4V, the direction of using these models to replace time-consuming manual annotation workflows and achieve "manual-annotation-free" training for downstream tasks has become a highly promising research avenue. This paper focuses on learning from noisy partial labels annotated by pre-trained VLMs and proposes an innovative collaborative consistency regularization (Co-Reg) method. Unlike the symmetric noise primarily addressed in traditional noisy label learning, the noise generated by pre-trained models is instance-dependent, embodying the underlying patterns of the pre-trained models themselves, which significantly increases the learning difficulty for the model. To address this, we simultaneously train two neural networks that implement collaborative purification of training labels through a "Co-Pseudo-Labeling" mechanism, while enforcing consistency regularization constraints in both the label space and feature representation space. Our method can also leverage few-shot manually annotated valid labels to further enhance its performances. Comparative experiments with different denoising and disambiguation algorithms, annotation manners, and pre-trained model application schemes fully validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, while revealing the broad prospects of integrating weakly-supervised learning techniques into the knowledge distillation process of pre-trained models.

<title>DiaBlo: Diagonal Blocks Are Sufficient For Finetuning</title>

Abstract: Finetuning is a critical step for adapting large language models (LLMs) to domain-specific downstream tasks. To mitigate the substantial computational and memory costs of full-model fine-tuning, Parameter-Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) methods have been proposed to update only a small subset of model parameters. However, performance gaps between PEFT approaches and full-model fine-tuning still exist. In this work, we present DiaBlo, a simple yet effective PEFT approach that updates only the diagonal blocks of selected model weight matrices. Unlike Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, DiaBlo eliminates the need for low rank matrix products, thereby avoiding the reliance on auxiliary initialization schemes or customized optimization strategies to improve convergence. This design leads to stable and robust convergence while maintaining comparable memory efficiency and training speed to LoRA. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of tasks, including commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, code generation, and safety alignment, to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of DiaBlo. Across these benchmarks, DiaBlo demonstrates strong and consistent performance while maintaining high memory efficiency and fast finetuning speed. Codes are available at https://github.com/ziyangjoy/DiaBlo.

Abstract: Despite growing interest in domain-specific benchmarking of large language models (LLMs) and agents, current evaluations remain limited to static, small-scale datasets, especially in high-stakes tasks like network operations that demand reliability for deployments. We present NetPress, an automated benchmark generation framework for evaluating LLM agents in network applications. NetPress introduces a unified abstraction with state and action, enabling dynamic generation of diverse query sets along with corresponding ground truths. At runtime, users can specify benchmark configurations to generate millions of queries on the fly. In addition to dynamic benchmark construction, NetPress integrates with network emulators to provide realistic environment feedback, supporting comprehensive evaluation across correctness, safety, and latency. We instantiate NetPress on three representative applications, revealing interesting fine-grained differences in agent behavior that static, correctness-only benchmarks often miss. NetPress moves LLM evaluation toward realistic, scalable testing in infrastructure-centric domains, helping close the gap between benchmark performance and real-world deployment readiness. Code is available at https://github.com/Froot-NetSys/NetPress.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is crucial for aligning text-to-image (T2I) models with human preferences. However, RLHF's feedback mechanism also opens new pathways for adversaries. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of hijacking T2I models by poisoning a small fraction of preference data with natural-appearing examples. Specifically, we propose BadReward, a stealthy clean-label poisoning attack targeting the reward model in multi-modal RLHF. BadReward operates by inducing feature collisions between visually contradicted preference data instances, thereby corrupting the reward model and indirectly compromising the T2I model's integrity. Unlike existing alignment poisoning techniques focused on single (text) modality, BadReward is independent of the preference annotation process, enhancing its stealth and practical threat. Extensive experiments on popular T2I models show that BadReward can consistently guide the generation towards improper outputs, such as biased or violent imagery, for targeted concepts. Our findings underscore the amplified threat landscape for RLHF in multi-modal systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses. Disclaimer.

<title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title>

Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection. The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.

Abstract: Automated interpretation of CT images-particularly localizing and describing abnormal findings across multi-plane and whole-body scans-remains a significant challenge in clinical radiology. This work aims to address this challenge through four key contributions: (i) On taxonomy, we collaborate with senior radiologists to propose a comprehensive hierarchical classification system, with 404 representative abnormal findings across all body regions; (ii) On data, we contribute a dataset containing over 14.5K CT images from multiple planes and all human body regions, and meticulously provide grounding annotations for over 19K abnormalities, each linked to the detailed description and cast into the taxonomy; (iii) On model development, we propose OminiAbnorm-CT, which can automatically ground and describe abnormal findings on multi-plane and whole-body CT images based on text queries, while also allowing flexible interaction through visual prompts; (iv) On benchmarks, we establish three representative evaluation tasks based on real clinical scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we show that OminiAbnorm-CT can significantly outperform existing methods on all the tasks and metrics.

Abstract: While recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have accelerated the development of language-guided robot planners, their black-box nature often lacks safety guarantees and interpretability crucial for real-world deployment. Conversely, classical symbolic planners offer rigorous safety verification but require significant expert knowledge for setup. To bridge the current gap, this paper proposes ViLaIn-TAMP, a hybrid planning framework for enabling verifiable, interpretable, and autonomous robot behaviors. ViLaIn-TAMP comprises three main components: (1) ViLaIn (Vision-Language Interpreter) - A prior framework that converts multimodal inputs into structured problem specifications using off-the-shelf VLMs without additional domain-specific training, (2) a modular Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) system that grounds these specifications in actionable trajectory sequences through symbolic and geometric constraint reasoning and can utilize learning-based skills for key manipulation phases, and (3) a corrective planning module which receives concrete feedback on failed solution attempts from the motion and task planning components and can feed adapted logic and geometric feasibility constraints back to ViLaIn to improve and further refine the specification. We evaluate our framework on several challenging manipulation tasks in a cooking domain. We demonstrate that the proposed closed-loop corrective architecture exhibits a more than 30% higher mean success rate for ViLaIn-TAMP compared to without corrective planning.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in high-quality image and video generation but incur substantial compute cost at inference. A common observation is that DiT latent noise vectors change slowly across inference steps, which suggests that the DiT compute may be redundant across steps. In this paper, we aim to speed up inference by reducing this redundancy, without additional training. We first study how activations change between steps in two state-of-the-art open-source DiTs. We find that just 5-25% of the values in attention and MLP explain 70-90% of the change in activations across steps. This finding motivates our approach, Chipmunk, which uses dynamic sparsity at inference time to recompute only the fastest-changing intermediate activations, while caching the rest. Dynamic sparsity introduces two systems challenges: (1) sparse attention and MLP operations tend to underutilize GPU tensor cores; and (2) computing dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime and caching activations both introduce overhead. To address these challenges, Chipmunk first uses a voxel-based reordering of input tokens to introduce column-wise sparsity. We implement column-sparse kernels utilizing efficient sparse gathers from global to shared GPU memory, achieving a 9.3x speedup at 93% sparsity compared to highly-optimized dense baselines. Second, Chipmunk overlaps the computation of sparsity patterns and cache updates with other parts of the computation (e.g., second layer of the MLP) to hide the extra latency. Chipmunk achieves up to 2.16x speedup on HunyuanVideo and 1.41x on FLUX.1-dev without compromising generation quality. Furthermore, we show that Chipmunk can be stacked on top of full step caching, achieving a 3.72x speedup on HunyuanVideo, a 2.67x speedup on WAN2.1, and a 2.25x speedup on FLUX.1-dev with minimal quality impact.

Abstract: Steering language models (LMs) by modifying internal activations is a popular approach for controlling text generation. Unsupervised dictionary learning methods, e.g., sparse autoencoders, can be scaled to produce many steering vectors, but lack guarantees on the individual efficacy of each vector and control over the coverage of relevant steering tasks. In contrast, supervised methods for constructing steering vectors are targeted and effective, but require more data collection and training for each additional steering vector produced. In this work, we introduce HyperSteer, a family of hypernetwork-based architectures which are trained end-to-end to generate steering vectors conditioned on the natural language steering prompts and the internals of the steered LM. In our evaluations, we show that scaling HyperSteer with thousands of steering prompts exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art activation steering methods, even on steering prompts never seen during training. Moreover, HyperSteer performs on par with steering-via-prompting.

Abstract: Modern causal language models stack many attention blocks to improve performance, but not all blocks are necessary for every task. We propose Hopscotch, a simple yet effective method that identifies and skips attention blocks with least contributions to a task and adapts to preserve output quality. Hopscotch jointly optimizes which blocks to skip and how to scale the outputs of the remaining layers. By introducing lightweight, trainable scaling parameters to attention and MLP blocks, it mitigates distribution shifts in hidden states caused by removing attention blocks. Hopscotch does not modify model weights or require access to pretraining or instruction-tuning data, and is compatible with existing model compression techniques. When applied to $\texttt{Llama-3.1-8B}$ and $\texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}$, Hopscotch achieves less than a 2% drop in performance even after skipping four attention blocks.

<title>The Future of Continual Learning in the Era of Foundation Models: Three Key Directions</title>

Abstract: Continual learning--the ability to acquire, retain, and refine knowledge over time--has always been fundamental to intelligence, both human and artificial. Historically, different AI paradigms have acknowledged this need, albeit with varying priorities: early expert and production systems focused on incremental knowledge consolidation, while reinforcement learning emphasised dynamic adaptation. With the rise of deep learning, deep continual learning has primarily focused on learning robust and reusable representations over time to solve sequences of increasingly complex tasks. However, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation models has raised the question: Do we still need continual learning when centralised, monolithic models can tackle diverse tasks with access to internet-scale knowledge? We argue that continual learning remains essential for three key reasons: (i) continual pre-training is still necessary to ensure foundation models remain up to date, mitigating knowledge staleness and distribution shifts while integrating new information; (ii) continual fine-tuning enables models to specialise and personalise, adapting to domain-specific tasks, user preferences, and real-world constraints without full retraining, avoiding the need for computationally expensive long context-windows; (iii) continual compositionality offers a scalable and modular approach to intelligence, enabling the orchestration of foundation models and agents to be dynamically composed, recombined, and adapted. While continual pre-training and fine-tuning are explored as niche research directions, we argue it is continual compositionality that will mark the rebirth of continual learning. The future of AI will not be defined by a single static model but by an ecosystem of continually evolving and interacting models, making continual learning more relevant than ever.

Abstract: To date, distributional reinforcement learning (distributional RL) methods have exclusively focused on the discounted setting, where an agent aims to optimize a potentially-discounted sum of rewards over time. In this work, we extend distributional RL to the average-reward setting, where an agent aims to optimize the reward received per time-step. In particular, we utilize a quantile-based approach to develop the first set of algorithms that can successfully learn and/or optimize the long-run per-step reward distribution, as well as the differential return distribution of an average-reward MDP. We derive proven-convergent tabular algorithms for both prediction and control, as well as a broader family of algorithms that have appealing scaling properties. Empirically, we find that these algorithms consistently yield competitive performance when compared to their non-distributional equivalents, while also capturing rich information about the long-run reward and return distributions.

<title>Mitigating Non-IID Drift in Zeroth-Order Federated LLM Fine-Tuning with Transferable Sparsity</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning enables collaborative fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) across decentralized Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) clients, but such models' massive parameter sizes lead to significant memory and communication challenges. This work introduces Meerkat, a sparse zeroth-order optimization (ZO) method designed for federated LLM fine-tuning. By limiting fine-tuning to a transferable, static, extremely sparse subset of parameters, Meerkat achieves remarkable communication efficiency, enabling cost-effective high-frequency synchronization. With theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that this high-frequency communication effectively mitigates Non-IID data challenges and leads to superior performance compared to full-parameter ZO. Furthermore, experiment results show that Meerkat outperforms existing sparsity baselines with better performance at the same communication frequency. To further handle Non-IID drift, Meerkat leverages traceable local updates and forms a virtual path for each client. This virtual path mechanism reveals the GradIP phenomenon: the inner products between LLM pre-training gradients maintained by server and client gradients estimated via ZO converges for extreme Non-IID clients but oscillates for IID ones. This distinct behavior provides a signal for identifying clients with extreme data heterogeneity. Using this signal, Meerkat-vp is proposed to analyze GradIP trajectories to identify extreme Non-IID clients and applies early stopping to enhance aggregated model quality. Experiments confirm that Meerkat and Meerkat-vp significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ZO federated LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory inputs at the billion-parameter scale. The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse, and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm. We make all code available at https://github.com/eliotjones1/robogcg .

<title>Robustness in Both Domains: CLIP Needs a Robust Text Encoder</title>

Abstract: Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) - instances where models generate plausible but factually incorrect information - present a significant challenge for AI.
  We introduce "Ask a Local", a novel hallucination detection method exploiting the intuition that specialized models exhibit greater surprise when encountering domain-specific inaccuracies. Our approach computes divergence between perplexity distributions of language-specialized models to identify potentially hallucinated spans. Our method is particularly well-suited for a multilingual context, as it naturally scales to multiple languages without the need for adaptation, relying on external data sources, or performing training. Moreover, we select computationally efficient models, providing a scalable solution that can be applied to a wide range of languages and domains.
  Our results on a human-annotated question-answer dataset spanning 14 languages demonstrate consistent performance across languages, with Intersection-over-Union (IoU) scores around 0.3 and comparable Spearman correlation values. Our model shows particularly strong performance on Italian and Catalan, with IoU scores of 0.42 and 0.38, respectively, while maintaining cross-lingual effectiveness without language-specific adaptations. We release our code and architecture to facilitate further research in multilingual hallucination detection.

Abstract: Foundation models have begun to transform image analysis by acting as pretrained generalist backbones that can be adapted to many tasks even when post-training data are limited, yet their impact on spatial proteomics, imaging that maps proteins at single-cell resolution, remains limited. Here, we introduce KRONOS, a foundation model built for spatial proteomics. KRONOS was trained in a self-supervised manner on over 47 million image patches covering 175 protein markers, 16 tissue types, and 8 fluorescence-based imaging platforms. We introduce key architectural adaptations to address the high-dimensional, multi-channel, and heterogeneous nature of multiplex imaging. We demonstrate that KRONOS learns biologically meaningful representations across multiple scales, ranging from cellular and microenvironment to tissue levels, enabling it to address diverse downstream tasks, including cell phenotyping, region classification, and patient stratification. Evaluated across 11 independent cohorts, KRONOS achieves state-of-the-art performance across cell phenotyping, treatment response prediction, and retrieval tasks, and is highly data-efficient. KRONOS also introduces the paradigm of segmentation-free patch-level processing for efficient and scalable spatial proteomics analysis, allowing cross-institutional comparisons, and as an image reverse search engine for spatial patterns. Together, these results position KRONOS as a flexible and scalable tool for spatial proteomics. The model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/KRONOS.

<title>Automated Traffic Incident Response Plans using Generative Artificial Intelligence: Part 1 -- Building the Incident Response Benchmark</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03381</link>

Abstract: Traffic incidents remain a critical public safety concern worldwide, with Australia recording 1,300 road fatalities in 2024, which is the highest toll in 12 years. Similarly, the United States reports approximately 6 million crashes annually, raising significant challenges in terms of a fast reponse time and operational management. Traditional response protocols rely on human decision-making, which introduces potential inconsistencies and delays during critical moments when every minute impacts both safety outcomes and network performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Incident Response Benchmark that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically generate response plans for incoming traffic incidents. Our approach aims to significantly reduce incident resolution times by suggesting context-appropriate actions such as variable message sign deployment, lane closures, and emergency resource allocation adapted to specific incident characteristics. First, the proposed methodology uses real-world incident reports from the Performance Measurement System (PeMS) as training and evaluation data. We extract historically implemented actions from these reports and compare them against AI-generated response plans that suggest specific actions, such as lane closures, variable message sign announcements, and/or dispatching appropriate emergency resources. Second, model evaluations reveal that advanced generative AI models like GPT-4o and Grok 2 achieve superior alignment with expert solutions, demonstrated by minimized Hamming distances (averaging 2.96-2.98) and low weighted differences (approximately 0.27-0.28). Conversely, while Gemini 1.5 Pro records the lowest count of missed actions, its extremely high number of unnecessary actions (1547 compared to 225 for GPT-4o) indicates an over-triggering strategy that reduces the overall plan efficiency.

<title>Universal Reusability in Recommender Systems: The Case for Dataset- and Task-Independent Frameworks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03391</link>

Abstract: Recommender systems are pivotal in delivering personalized experiences across industries, yet their adoption and scalability remain hindered by the need for extensive dataset- and task-specific configurations. Existing systems often require significant manual intervention, domain expertise, and engineering effort to adapt to new datasets or tasks, creating barriers to entry and limiting reusability. In contrast, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the transformative potential of reusable systems, where a single model can handle diverse tasks without significant reconfiguration. Inspired by this paradigm, we propose the Dataset- and Task-Independent Recommender System (DTIRS), a framework aimed at maximizing the reusability of recommender systems while minimizing barriers to entry. Unlike LLMs, which achieve task generalization directly, DTIRS focuses on eliminating the need to rebuild or reconfigure recommendation pipelines for every new dataset or task, even though models may still need retraining on new data. By leveraging the novel Dataset Description Language (DsDL), DTIRS enables standardized dataset descriptions and explicit task definitions, allowing autonomous feature engineering, model selection, and optimization. This paper introduces the concept of DTIRS and establishes a roadmap for transitioning from Level-1 automation (dataset-agnostic but task-specific systems) to Level-2 automation (fully dataset- and task-independent systems). Achieving this paradigm would maximize code reusability and lower barriers to adoption. We discuss key challenges, including the trade-offs between generalization and specialization, computational overhead, and scalability, while presenting DsDL as a foundational tool for this vision.

Abstract: With the onset of large language models (LLMs), the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) models is becoming increasingly multi-dimensional. Accordingly, there have been several large, multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks put forward to evaluate LLMs. Though these frameworks are much more realistic than previous attempts which only used a single score like accuracy, multi-dimensional evaluations can complicate decision-making since there is no obvious way to select an optimal model. This work introduces preference sampling, a method to extract a scalar trustworthiness score from multi-dimensional evaluation results by considering the many characteristics of model performance which users value. We show that preference sampling improves upon alternate aggregation methods by using multi-dimensional trustworthiness evaluations of LLMs from TrustLLM and DecodingTrust. We find that preference sampling is consistently reductive, fully reducing the set of candidate models 100% of the time whereas Pareto optimality never reduces the set by more than 50%. Likewise, preference sampling is consistently sensitive to user priors-allowing users to specify the relative weighting and confidence of their preferences-whereas averaging scores is intransigent to the users' prior knowledge.

<title>The Impact of On-Policy Parallelized Data Collection on Deep Reinforcement Learning Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of parallel actors for data collection has been an effective technique used in reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. The manner in which data is collected in these algorithms, controlled via the number of parallel environments and the rollout length, induces a form of bias-variance trade-off; the number of training passes over the collected data, on the other hand, must strike a balance between sample efficiency and overfitting. We conduct an empirical analysis of these trade-offs on PPO, one of the most popular RL algorithms that uses parallel actors, and establish connections to network plasticity and, more generally, optimization stability. We examine its impact on network architectures, as well as the hyper-parameter sensitivity when scaling data. Our analyses indicate that larger dataset sizes can increase final performance across a variety of settings, and that scaling parallel environments is more effective than increasing rollout lengths. These findings highlight the critical role of data collection strategies in improving agent performance.

<title>Multi-Spectral Gaussian Splatting with Neural Color Representation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MS-Splatting -- a multi-spectral 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework that is able to generate multi-view consistent novel views from images of multiple, independent cameras with different spectral domains. In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not require cross-modal camera calibration and is versatile enough to model a variety of different spectra, including thermal and near-infra red, without any algorithmic changes.
  Unlike existing 3DGS-based frameworks that treat each modality separately (by optimizing per-channel spherical harmonics) and therefore fail to exploit the underlying spectral and spatial correlations, our method leverages a novel neural color representation that encodes multi-spectral information into a learned, compact, per-splat feature embedding. A shallow multi-layer perceptron (MLP) then decodes this embedding to obtain spectral color values, enabling joint learning of all bands within a unified representation.
  Our experiments show that this simple yet effective strategy is able to improve multi-spectral rendering quality, while also leading to improved per-spectra rendering quality over state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technique in agricultural applications to render vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI).

Abstract: Evaluating explainability techniques, such as SHAP and LRP, in the context of audio deepfake detection is challenging due to lack of clear ground truth annotations. In the cases when we are able to obtain the ground truth, we find that these methods struggle to provide accurate explanations. In this work, we propose a novel data-driven approach to identify artifact regions in deepfake audio. We consider paired real and vocoded audio, and use the difference in time-frequency representation as the ground-truth explanation. The difference signal then serves as a supervision to train a diffusion model to expose the deepfake artifacts in a given vocoded audio. Experimental results on the VocV4 and LibriSeVoc datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional explainability techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: Simulation-based design space exploration (DSE) aims to efficiently optimize high-dimensional structured designs under complex constraints and expensive evaluation costs. Existing approaches, including heuristic and multi-step reinforcement learning (RL) methods, struggle to balance sampling efficiency and constraint satisfaction due to sparse, delayed feedback, and large hybrid action spaces. In this paper, we introduce CORE, a constraint-aware, one-step RL method for simulationguided DSE. In CORE, the policy agent learns to sample design configurations by defining a structured distribution over them, incorporating dependencies via a scaling-graph-based decoder, and by reward shaping to penalize invalid designs based on the feedback obtained from simulation. CORE updates the policy using a surrogate objective that compares the rewards of designs within a sampled batch, without learning a value function. This critic-free formulation enables efficient learning by encouraging the selection of higher-reward designs. We instantiate CORE for hardware-mapping co-design of neural network accelerators, demonstrating that it significantly improves sample efficiency and achieves better accelerator configurations compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach is general and applicable to a broad class of discrete-continuous constrained design problems.

<title>Explainable AI: XAI-Guided Context-Aware Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a powerful tool for improving the performance of AI models, going beyond providing model transparency and interpretability. The scarcity of labeled data remains a fundamental challenge in developing robust and generalizable AI models, particularly for low-resource languages. Conventional data augmentation techniques introduce noise, cause semantic drift, disrupt contextual coherence, lack control, and lead to overfitting. To address these challenges, we propose XAI-Guided Context-Aware Data Augmentation. This novel framework leverages XAI techniques to modify less critical features while selectively preserving most task-relevant features. Our approach integrates an iterative feedback loop, which refines augmented data over multiple augmentation cycles based on explainability-driven insights and the model performance gain. Our experimental results demonstrate that XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT improve the accuracy of models on hate speech and sentiment analysis tasks by 6.6% and 8.1%, respectively, compared to the baseline, using the Amharic dataset with the XLM-R model. XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT outperform existing augmentation techniques by 4.8% and 5%, respectively, on the same dataset and model. Overall, XAI-SR-BT and XAI-PR-BT consistently outperform both baseline and conventional augmentation techniques across all tasks and models. This study provides a more controlled, interpretable, and context-aware solution to data augmentation, addressing critical limitations of existing augmentation techniques and offering a new paradigm shift for leveraging XAI techniques to enhance AI model training.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large language models (LLMs) relies heavily on the availability of abundant high-quality training data. However, the high cost of acquiring annotated data often prevents models from obtaining capabilities to tackle downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, EpiCoDe that boosts model performance in data-scarcity scenarios without extra training. We first employ model extrapolation to enhance a finetuned model with its inferior version, and then adopt contrastive decoding to further reduce predicted errors, by comparing the logit scores given by the extrapolated and the vanilla finetuned model. Experiments across three tasks over four different LLMs show that EpiCoDe consistently outperforms existing methods with significant and robust improvement. We also propose a new theoretical framework to reveal the mechanism behind contrastive decoding in data-scarcity scenarios, which further helps us better understand the effectiveness of EpiCoDe.

<title>Measuring Human Involvement in AI-Generated Text: A Case Study on Academic Writing</title>

Abstract: Content creation has dramatically progressed with the rapid advancement of large language models like ChatGPT and Claude. While this progress has greatly enhanced various aspects of life and work, it has also negatively affected certain areas of society. A recent survey revealed that nearly 30% of college students use generative AI to help write academic papers and reports. Most countermeasures treat the detection of AI-generated text as a binary classification task and thus lack robustness. This approach overlooks human involvement in the generation of content even though human-machine collaboration is becoming mainstream. Besides generating entire texts, people may use machines to complete or revise texts. Such human involvement varies case by case, which makes binary classification a less than satisfactory approach. We refer to this situation as participation detection obfuscation. We propose using BERTScore as a metric to measure human involvement in the generation process and a multi-task RoBERTa-based regressor trained on a token classification task to address this problem. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we simulated academic-based scenarios and created a continuous dataset reflecting various levels of human involvement. All of the existing detectors we examined failed to detect the level of human involvement on this dataset. Our method, however, succeeded (F1 score of 0.9423 and a regressor mean squared error of 0.004). Moreover, it demonstrated some generalizability across generative models.

Abstract: With over 1,000,000 images from more than 10,000 exposures using state-of-the-art high-contrast imagers (e.g., Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE) in the search for exoplanets, can artificial intelligence (AI) serve as a transformative tool in imaging Earth-like exoplanets in the coming decade? In this paper, we introduce a benchmark and explore this question from a polarimetric image representation learning perspective. Despite extensive investments over the past decade, only a few new exoplanets have been directly imaged. Existing imaging approaches rely heavily on labor-intensive labeling of reference stars, which serve as background to extract circumstellar objects (disks or exoplanets) around target stars. With our POLARIS (POlarized Light dAta for total intensity Representation learning of direct Imaging of exoplanetary Systems) dataset, we classify reference star and circumstellar disk images using the full public SPHERE/IRDIS polarized-light archive since 2014, requiring less than 10 percent manual labeling. We evaluate a range of models including statistical, generative, and large vision-language models and provide baseline performance. We also propose an unsupervised generative representation learning framework that integrates these models, achieving superior performance and enhanced representational power. To our knowledge, this is the first uniformly reduced, high-quality exoplanet imaging dataset, rare in astrophysics and machine learning. By releasing this dataset and baselines, we aim to equip astrophysicists with new tools and engage data scientists in advancing direct exoplanet imaging, catalyzing major interdisciplinary breakthroughs.

Abstract: Object goal navigation is a fundamental task in embodied AI, where an agent is instructed to locate a target object in an unexplored environment. Traditional learning-based methods rely heavily on large-scale annotated data or require extensive interaction with the environment in a reinforcement learning setting, often failing to generalize to novel environments and limiting scalability. To overcome these challenges, we explore a zero-shot setting where the agent operates without task-specific training, enabling more scalable and adaptable solution. Recent advances in Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) offer powerful capabilities for visual understanding and reasoning, making them ideal for agents to comprehend scenes, identify relevant regions, and infer the likely locations of objects. In this work, we present a zero-shot object goal navigation framework that integrates the perceptual strength of VFMs with a model-based planner that is capable of long-horizon decision making through frontier exploration. We evaluate our approach on the HM3D dataset using the Habitat simulator and demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of success weighted by path length for zero-shot object goal navigation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have improved complex video understanding, but existing methods often struggle to adapt to domain-specific skills (e.g., event detection, spatial relation understanding, emotion understanding) over various video content. To address this, we propose Video-Skill-CoT (a.k.a. Video-SKoT), a framework that automatically constructs and leverages skill-aware CoT supervisions for domain-adaptive video reasoning. First, we construct skill-based CoT annotations: we extract domain-relevant reasoning skills from training questions, cluster them into a shared skill taxonomy, and create detailed multi-step CoT rationale tailored to each video-question pair for training. Second, we introduce a skill-specific expert learning framework. Each expert module specializes in a subset of reasoning skills and is trained with lightweight adapters using the collected CoT supervision. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on three video understanding benchmarks, where Video-SKoT consistently outperforms strong baselines. We also provide in-depth analyses on comparing different CoT annotation pipelines and learned skills over multiple video domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to set new standards in knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks, yet their high computational demands limit widespread adoption. While distilling large models into smaller ones offers a sustainable solution, current techniques--such as static knowledge distillation, resource-intensive reinforcement learning from human feedback, or limited self-reflection--struggle to yield substantial and lasting performance gains. In this paper, we present a novel Debate and Reflect (D&amp;R) framework that orchestrates multi-turn debates between smaller models and stronger teacher models, eliciting actionable feedback (e.g., error analysis, corrective strategies) to guide student models. Further, we introduce Tree-structured Direct Preference Optimization (T-DPO) to efficiently leverage these debate logs, organizing interactions into a hierarchical format for effective training. Empirical evaluations across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves smaller-model accuracy, robustness, and generalization, outperforming conventional baselines by a large margin.

Abstract: Advancements in generative models have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) to perform complex virtual tasks such as writing and code generation, which do not generalize well to physical multi-agent robotic teams. Current frameworks often treat agents as conceptual task executors rather than physically embodied entities, and overlook critical real-world constraints such as spatial context, robotic capabilities (e.g., sensing and navigation). To probe this gap, we reconfigure and stress-test a hierarchical multi-agent robotic team built on the CrewAI framework in a simulated emergency department onboarding scenario. We identify five persistent failure modes: role misalignment; tool access violations; lack of in-time handling of failure reports; noncompliance with prescribed workflows; bypassing or false reporting of task completion. Based on this analysis, we propose three design guidelines emphasizing process transparency, proactive failure recovery, and contextual grounding. Our work informs the development of more resilient and robust multi-agent robotic systems (MARS), including opportunities to extend virtual multi-agent frameworks to the real world.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by using a small draft model to predict multiple tokens, and a large target model to verify these tokens in parallel. Recent studies leverage the hidden state of the target model to enhance draft model prediction accuracy. However, existing methods suffer from the degrading quality of draft token predictions at later positions, due to error accumulation in draft model generated features. In this paper, we propose Position Specialists (PosS), which consist of multiple position-specialized draft layers to generate tokens at assigned position(s). Position specialists greatly improve token acceptance rate at later positions per drafting round, as each specialist only needs to focus on handling a certain level of draft model feature deviation. Experiment results on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Llama-2-13B-chat across six datasets demonstrate that PosS effectively improves over baselines on average acceptance length and speed-up ratio.

Abstract: Autonomous driving promises significant advancements in mobility, road safety and traffic efficiency, yet reinforcement learning and imitation learning face safe-exploration and distribution-shift challenges. Although human-AI collaboration alleviates these issues, it often relies heavily on extensive human intervention, which increases costs and reduces efficiency. This paper develops a confidence-guided human-AI collaboration (C-HAC) strategy to overcome these limitations. First, C-HAC employs a distributional proxy value propagation method within the distributional soft actor-critic (DSAC) framework. By leveraging return distributions to represent human intentions C-HAC achieves rapid and stable learning of human-guided policies with minimal human interaction. Subsequently, a shared control mechanism is activated to integrate the learned human-guided policy with a self-learning policy that maximizes cumulative rewards. This enables the agent to explore independently and continuously enhance its performance beyond human guidance. Finally, a policy confidence evaluation algorithm capitalizes on DSAC's return distribution networks to facilitate dynamic switching between human-guided and self-learning policies via a confidence-based intervention function. This ensures the agent can pursue optimal policies while maintaining safety and performance guarantees. Extensive experiments across diverse driving scenarios reveal that C-HAC significantly outperforms conventional methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and overall performance, achieving state-of-the-art results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated through real-world road tests in complex traffic conditions. The videos and code are available at: https://github.com/lzqw/C-HAC.

Abstract: We propose DaigNet, a new approach to object detection with which we can detect an object bounding box using diagonal constraints on adjacency matrix of a graph convolutional network (GCN). We propose two diagonalization algorithms based on hard and soft constraints on adjacency matrix and two loss functions using diagonal constraint and complementary constraint. The DaigNet eliminates the need for designing a set of anchor boxes commonly used. To prove feasibility of our novel detector, we adopt detection head in YOLO models. Experiments show that the DiagNet achieves 7.5% higher mAP50 on Pascal VOC than YOLOv1. The DiagNet also shows 5.1% higher mAP on MS COCO than YOLOv3u, 3.7% higher mAP than YOLOv5u, and 2.9% higher mAP than YOLOv8.

<title>KG-BiLM: Knowledge Graph Embedding via Bidirectional Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge representation learning (KRL) highlight the urgent necessity to unify symbolic knowledge graphs (KGs) with language models (LMs) for richer semantic understanding. However, existing approaches typically prioritize either graph structure or textual semantics, leaving a gap: a unified framework that simultaneously captures global KG connectivity, nuanced linguistic context, and discriminative reasoning semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce KG-BiLM, a bidirectional LM framework that fuses structural cues from KGs with the semantic expressiveness of generative transformers. KG-BiLM incorporates three key components: (i) Bidirectional Knowledge Attention, which removes the causal mask to enable full interaction among all tokens and entities; (ii) Knowledge-Masked Prediction, which encourages the model to leverage both local semantic contexts and global graph connectivity; and (iii) Contrastive Graph Semantic Aggregation, which preserves KG structure via contrastive alignment of sampled sub-graph representations. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that KG-BiLM outperforms strong baselines in link prediction, especially on large-scale graphs with complex multi-hop relations - validating its effectiveness in unifying structural information and textual semantics.

Abstract: We present ViTSGMM, an image recognition network that leverages semi-supervised learning in a highly efficient manner. Existing works often rely on complex training techniques and architectures, while their generalization ability when dealing with extremely limited labeled data remains to be improved. To address these limitations, we construct a hierarchical mixture density classification decision mechanism by optimizing mutual information between feature representations and target classes, compressing redundant information while retaining crucial discriminative components. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on STL-10 and CIFAR-10/100 datasets when using negligible labeled samples. Notably, this paper also reveals a long-overlooked data leakage issue in the STL-10 dataset for semi-supervised learning tasks and removes duplicates to ensure the reliability of experimental results.

<title>A Class Inference Scheme With Dempster-Shafer Theory for Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems</title>

Abstract: The decision-making process significantly influences the predictions of machine learning models. This is especially important in rule-based systems such as Learning Fuzzy-Classifier Systems (LFCSs) where the selection and application of rules directly determine prediction accuracy and reliability. LFCSs combine evolutionary algorithms with supervised learning to optimize fuzzy classification rules, offering enhanced interpretability and robustness. Despite these advantages, research on improving decision-making mechanisms (i.e., class inference schemes) in LFCSs remains limited. Most LFCSs use voting-based or single-winner-based inference schemes. These schemes rely on classification performance on training data and may not perform well on unseen data, risking overfitting. To address these limitations, this article introduces a novel class inference scheme for LFCSs based on the Dempster-Shafer Theory of Evidence (DS theory). The proposed scheme handles uncertainty well. By using the DS theory, the scheme calculates belief masses (i.e., measures of belief) for each specific class and the ``I don't know'' state from each fuzzy rule and infers a class from these belief masses. Unlike the conventional schemes, the proposed scheme also considers the ``I don't know'' state that reflects uncertainty, thereby improving the transparency and reliability of LFCSs. Applied to a variant of LFCS (i.e., Fuzzy-UCS), the proposed scheme demonstrates statistically significant improvements in terms of test macro F1 scores across 30 real-world datasets compared to conventional voting-based and single-winner-based fuzzy inference schemes. It forms smoother decision boundaries, provides reliable confidence measures, and enhances the robustness and generalizability of LFCSs in real-world applications. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/jUCS.

<title>BiMa: Towards Biases Mitigation for Text-Video Retrieval via Scene Element Guidance</title>

Abstract: Text-video retrieval (TVR) systems often suffer from visual-linguistic biases present in datasets, which cause pre-trained vision-language models to overlook key details. To address this, we propose BiMa, a novel framework designed to mitigate biases in both visual and textual representations. Our approach begins by generating scene elements that characterize each video by identifying relevant entities/objects and activities. For visual debiasing, we integrate these scene elements into the video embeddings, enhancing them to emphasize fine-grained and salient details. For textual debiasing, we introduce a mechanism to disentangle text features into content and bias components, enabling the model to focus on meaningful content while separately handling biased information. Extensive experiments and ablation studies across five major TVR benchmarks (i.e., MSR-VTT, MSVD, LSMDC, ActivityNet, and DiDeMo) demonstrate the competitive performance of BiMa. Additionally, the model's bias mitigation capability is consistently validated by its strong results on out-of-distribution retrieval tasks.

<title>Purifying Shampoo: Investigating Shampoo's Heuristics by Decomposing its Preconditioner</title>

Abstract: The recent success of Shampoo in the AlgoPerf contest has sparked renewed interest in Kronecker-factorization-based optimization algorithms for training neural networks. Despite its success, Shampoo relies heavily on several heuristics such as learning rate grafting and stale preconditioning to achieve performance at-scale. These heuristics increase algorithmic complexity, necessitate further hyperparameter tuning, and lack theoretical justification. This paper investigates these heuristics from the angle of Frobenius norm approximation to full-matrix Adam and decouples the preconditioner's eigenvalues and eigenbasis updates. We show that grafting from Adam mitigates the staleness and mis-scaling of the preconditioner's eigenvalues and how correcting the eigenvalues directly can eliminate the need for learning rate grafting. To manage the error induced by infrequent eigenbasis computations, we propose an adaptive criterion for determining the eigenbasis computation frequency motivated by terminating a warm-started QR algorithm. This criterion decouples the update frequency of different preconditioner matrices and enables us to investigate the impact of approximation error on convergence. These practical techniques offer a principled angle towards removing Shampoo's heuristics and developing improved Kronecker-factorization-based training algorithms.

Abstract: Using the best Text-to-SQL methods in resource-constrained environments is challenging due to their reliance on resource-intensive open-source models. This paper introduces Auto Prompt SQL(AP-SQL), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between resource-efficient small open-source models and the powerful capabilities of large closed-source models for Text-to-SQL translation. Our method decomposes the task into schema filtering, retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL generation based on in-context examples, and prompt-driven schema linking and SQL generation. To improve schema selection accuracy, we fine-tune large language models. Crucially, we also explore the impact of prompt engineering throughout the process, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and Graph-of-Thought(GoT) templates to significantly enhance the model's reasoning for accurate SQL generation. Comprehensive evaluations on the Spider benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AP-SQL.

<title>Adapting Rule Representation With Four-Parameter Beta Distribution for Learning Classifier Systems</title>

Abstract: Rule representations significantly influence the search capabilities and decision boundaries within the search space of Learning Classifier Systems (LCSs), a family of rule-based machine learning systems that evolve interpretable models through evolutionary processes. However, it is very difficult to choose an appropriate rule representation for each problem. Additionally, some problems benefit from using different representations for different subspaces within the input space. Thus, an adaptive mechanism is needed to choose an appropriate rule representation for each rule in LCSs. This article introduces a flexible rule representation using a four-parameter beta distribution and integrates it into a fuzzy-style LCS. The four-parameter beta distribution can form various function shapes, and this flexibility enables our LCS to automatically select appropriate representations for different subspaces. Our rule representation can represent crisp/fuzzy decision boundaries in various boundary shapes, such as rectangles and bells, by controlling four parameters, compared to the standard representations such as trapezoidal ones. Leveraging this flexibility, our LCS is designed to adapt the appropriate rule representation for each subspace. Moreover, our LCS incorporates a generalization bias favoring crisp rules where feasible, enhancing model interpretability without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on real-world classification tasks show that our LCS achieves significantly superior test accuracy and produces more compact rule sets. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YNU-NakataLab/Beta4-UCS. An extended abstract related to this work is available at https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.174900805.59801248/v1.

Abstract: This study explores the use of self-supervised learning (SSL) models for tone recognition in three low-resource languages from North Eastern India: Angami, Ao, and Mizo. We evaluate four Wav2vec2.0 base models that were pre-trained on both tonal and non-tonal languages. We analyze tone-wise performance across the layers for all three languages and compare the different models. Our results show that tone recognition works best for Mizo and worst for Angami. The middle layers of the SSL models are the most important for tone recognition, regardless of the pre-training language, i.e. tonal or non-tonal. We have also found that the tone inventory, tone types, and dialectal variations affect tone recognition. These findings provide useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of SSL-based embeddings for tonal languages and highlight the potential for improving tone recognition in low-resource settings.

<title>VLMs Can Aggregate Scattered Training Patches</title>

Abstract: One way to mitigate risks in vision-language models (VLMs) is to remove dangerous samples in their training data. However, such data moderation can be easily bypassed when harmful images are split into small, benign-looking patches, scattered across many training samples. VLMs may then learn to piece these fragments together during training and generate harmful responses at inference, either from full images or text references. For instance, if trained on image patches from a bloody scene paired with the descriptions "safe," VLMs may later describe, the full image or a text reference to the scene, as "safe." We define the core ability of VLMs enabling this attack as $\textit{visual stitching}$ -- the ability to integrate visual information spread across multiple training samples that share the same textual descriptions. In our work, we first demonstrate visual stitching abilities in common open-source VLMs on three datasets where each image is labeled with a unique synthetic ID: we split each $(\texttt{image}, \texttt{ID})$ pair into $\{(\texttt{patch}, \texttt{ID})\}$ pairs at different granularity for finetuning, and we find that tuned models can verbalize the correct IDs from full images or text reference. Building on this, we simulate the adversarial data poisoning scenario mentioned above by using patches from dangerous images and replacing IDs with text descriptions like ``safe'' or ``unsafe'', demonstrating how harmful content can evade moderation in patches and later be reconstructed through visual stitching, posing serious VLM safety risks. Code is available at https://github.com/ZHZisZZ/visual-stitching.

<title>GCFL: A Gradient Correction-based Federated Learning Framework for Privacy-preserving CPSS</title>

Abstract: Federated learning, as a distributed architecture, shows great promise for applications in Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). In order to mitigate the privacy risks inherent in CPSS, the integration of differential privacy with federated learning has attracted considerable attention. Existing research mainly focuses on dynamically adjusting the noise added or discarding certain gradients to mitigate the noise introduced by differential privacy. However, these approaches fail to remove the noise that hinders convergence and correct the gradients affected by the noise, which significantly reduces the accuracy of model classification. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for differentially private federated learning that balances rigorous privacy guarantees with accuracy by introducing a server-side gradient correction mechanism. Specifically, after clients perform gradient clipping and noise perturbation, our framework detects deviations in the noisy local gradients and employs a projection mechanism to correct them, mitigating the negative impact of noise. Simultaneously, gradient projection promotes the alignment of gradients from different clients and guides the model towards convergence to a global optimum. We evaluate our framework on several benchmark datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same privacy budget.

Abstract: We present Subject Fidelity Optimization (SFO), a novel comparative learning framework for zero-shot subject-driven generation that enhances subject fidelity. Beyond supervised fine-tuning methods that rely only on positive targets and use the diffusion loss as in the pre-training stage, SFO introduces synthetic negative targets and explicitly guides the model to favor positives over negatives through pairwise comparison. For negative targets, we propose Condition-Degradation Negative Sampling (CDNS), which automatically generates distinctive and informative negatives by intentionally degrading visual and textual cues without expensive human annotations. Moreover, we reweight the diffusion timesteps to focus finetuning on intermediate steps where subject details emerge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFO with CDNS significantly outperforms baselines in terms of both subject fidelity and text alignment on a subject-driven generation benchmark.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks by effectively utilizing a prompting strategy. However, they are highly sensitive to input perturbations, such as typographical errors or slight character order errors, which can substantially degrade their performance. Despite advances in prompting techniques, developing a prompting strategy that explicitly mitigates the negative impact of such perturbations remains an open challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Robustness of Prompting (RoP), a novel prompting strategy specifically designed to enhance the robustness of LLMs. RoP consists of two stages: Error Correction and Guidance. In the Error Correction stage, RoP applies diverse perturbation methods to generate adversarial examples, which are then used to construct prompts that automatically correct input errors. In the Guidance stage, RoP generates an optimal guidance prompting based on the corrected input, steering the model toward more robust and accurate inferences. Through comprehensive experiments spanning arithmetic, commonsense, and logical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that RoP significantly improves LLMs' robustness against adversarial perturbations. Notably, it maintains model accuracy with only minimal degradation compared to clean input scenarios, thereby establishing RoP as a practical and effective approach for enhancing LLM robustness in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reward Models, essential for guiding Large Language Model optimization, are typically trained on fixed preference datasets, resulting in rigid alignment to single, implicit preference distributions. This prevents adaptation to diverse real-world needs-from conciseness in one task to detailed explanations in another. The standard practice of collecting task-specific preference data and retraining reward models is resource-intensive, often producing biased rewards, and limits practical application. We introduce generalizable, principle-following reward models. We propose that RMs should understand and adhere to dynamically provided natural language specifications of reward principles, similar to instruction-following in LLMs. To measure this capability, we develop RABench, a comprehensive benchmark for RMs focusing on generalization across diverse principles. Evaluations on RABench reveal poor generalization of current RMs. As a solution, we present RewardAnything, a novel RM designed and trained to explicitly follow natural language principles. We achieve SotA performance with RewardAnything in traditional RM benchmark simply by specifying a well-defined principle, and results on RABench show we excel in adapting to novel principles without retraining. Furthermore, RewardAnything integrates seamlessly with existing RLHF methods and we show by a case study on how to automatically and efficiently align LLMs with only natural language principles.

Abstract: Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind, a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.

Abstract: Real-time object detection is a fundamental but challenging task in computer vision, particularly when computational resources are limited. Although YOLO-series models have set strong benchmarks by balancing speed and accuracy, the increasing need for richer global context modeling has led to the use of Transformer-based architectures. Nevertheless, Transformers have high computational complexity because of their self-attention mechanism, which limits their practicality for real-time and edge deployments. To overcome these challenges, recent developments in linear state space models, such as Mamba, provide a promising alternative by enabling efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. Building on this insight, we propose MambaNeXt-YOLO, a novel object detection framework that balances accuracy and efficiency through three key contributions: (1) MambaNeXt Block: a hybrid design that integrates CNNs with Mamba to effectively capture both local features and long-range dependencies; (2) Multi-branch Asymmetric Fusion Pyramid Network (MAFPN): an enhanced feature pyramid architecture that improves multi-scale object detection across various object sizes; and (3) Edge-focused Efficiency: our method achieved 66.6\% mAP at 31.9 FPS on the PASCAL VOC dataset without any pre-training and supports deployment on edge devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and Orin NX.

Abstract: This paper introduces a preprocessing technique to speed up Structure-from-Motion (SfM) based pose estimation, which is critical for real-time applications like augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and robotics. Our method leverages the concept of a dominating set from graph theory to preprocess SfM models, significantly enhancing the speed of the pose estimation process without losing significant accuracy. Using the OnePose dataset, we evaluated our method across various SfM-based pose estimation techniques. The results demonstrate substantial improvements in processing speed, ranging from 1.5 to 14.48 times, and a reduction in reference images and point cloud size by factors of 17-23 and 2.27-4, respectively. This work offers a promising solution for efficient and accurate 3D pose estimation, balancing speed and accuracy in real-time applications.

Abstract: The composition of objects and their parts, along with object-object positional relationships, provides a rich source of information for representation learning. Hence, spatial-aware pretext tasks have been actively explored in self-supervised learning. Existing works commonly start from a grid structure, where the goal of the pretext task involves predicting the absolute position index of patches within a fixed grid. However, grid-based approaches fall short of capturing the fluid and continuous nature of real-world object compositions. We introduce PART, a self-supervised learning approach that leverages continuous relative transformations between off-grid patches to overcome these limitations. By modeling how parts relate to each other in a continuous space, PART learns the relative composition of images-an off-grid structural relative positioning process that generalizes beyond occlusions and deformations. In tasks requiring precise spatial understanding such as object detection and time series prediction, PART outperforms strong grid-based methods like MAE and DropPos, while also maintaining competitive performance on global classification tasks with minimal hyperparameter tuning. By breaking free from grid constraints, PART opens up an exciting new trajectory for universal self-supervised pretraining across diverse datatypes-from natural images to EEG signals-with promising potential in video, medical imaging, and audio.

Abstract: In this report, we present our champion solutions for the three egocentric video localization tracks of the Ego4D Episodic Memory Challenge at CVPR 2025. All tracks require precise localization of the interval within an untrimmed egocentric video. Previous unified video localization approaches often rely on late fusion strategies, which tend to yield suboptimal results. To address this, we adopt an early fusion-based video localization model to tackle all three tasks, aiming to enhance localization accuracy. Ultimately, our method achieved first place in the Natural Language Queries, Goal Step, and Moment Queries tracks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

<title>Verbalized Confidence Triggers Self-Verification: Emergent Behavior Without Explicit Reasoning Supervision</title>

Abstract: Uncertainty calibration is essential for the safe deployment of large language models (LLMs), particularly when users rely on verbalized confidence estimates. While prior work has focused on classifiers or short-form generation, confidence calibration for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning remains largely unexplored. Surprisingly, we find that supervised fine-tuning with scalar confidence labels alone suffices to elicit self-verification behavior of language models, without any explicit reasoning supervision or reinforcement learning-based rewards. Despite being trained only to produce a verbalized confidence score without any self-verifying examples, the model learns to generate longer and self-checking responses for low-confidence queries while providing more concise answers for high-confidence ones. We further propose a simple rethinking method that boosts performance via test-time scaling based on calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on GSM8K and held-out reasoning tasks such as MATH-500 and ARC-Challenge show that our confidence-aware fine-tuning improves both calibration and accuracy, while also enhancing interpretability by aligning the model's reasoning path with its confidence.

Abstract: Visuals are valuable tools for teaching math word problems (MWPs), helping young learners interpret textual descriptions into mathematical expressions before solving them. However, creating such visuals is labor-intensive and there is a lack of automated methods to support this process. In this paper, we present Math2Visual, an automatic framework for generating pedagogically meaningful visuals from MWP text descriptions. Math2Visual leverages a pre-defined visual language and a design space grounded in interviews with math teachers, to illustrate the core mathematical relationships in MWPs. Using Math2Visual, we construct an annotated dataset of 1,903 visuals and evaluate Text-to-Image (TTI) models for their ability to generate visuals that align with our design. We further fine-tune several TTI models with our dataset, demonstrating improvements in educational visual generation. Our work establishes a new benchmark for automated generation of pedagogically meaningful visuals and offers insights into key challenges in producing multimodal educational content, such as the misrepresentation of mathematical relationships and the omission of essential visual elements.

<title>ComRoPE: Scalable and Robust Rotary Position Embedding Parameterized by Trainable Commuting Angle Matrices</title>

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized various regions since it was proposed, and its effectiveness largely depends on the ability to encode positional information. Traditional position encoding methods exhibit significant limitations due to lack of robustness and flexibility of position. Therefore, Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) was proposed to alleviate these issues, which integrates positional information by rotating the embeddings in the attention mechanism. However, RoPE requires manually defined rotation matrices with limited transformation space, constraining the model's capacity. In this work, we propose ComRoPE, which generalizes RoPE by defining it in terms of trainable commuting angle matrices. Specifically, we demonstrate that pairwise commutativity of these matrices is essential for RoPE to achieve scalability and positional robustness. We formally define the RoPE Equation, which is an essential condition that ensures consistent performance with position offsets. Based on the theoretical analysis, we present two types of trainable commuting angle matrices as sufficient solutions to the RoPE equation, which significantly improve performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art method by 1.6% at training resolution and 2.9% at higher resolution on the ImageNet-1K dataset. Furthermore, our framework shows versatility in generalizing to existing RoPE formulations and offering new insights for future positional encoding research.

Abstract: Single image super-resolution is a well-known downstream task which aims to restore low-resolution images into high-resolution images. At present, models based on Transformers have shone brightly in the field of super-resolution due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in information. However, current methods typically compute self-attention in nonoverlapping windows to save computational costs, and the standard self-attention computation only focuses on its results, thereby neglecting the useful information across channels and the rich spatial structural information generated in the intermediate process. Channel attention and spatial attention have, respectively, brought significant improvements to various downstream visual tasks in terms of extracting feature dependency and spatial structure relationships, but the synergistic relationship between channel and spatial attention has not been fully explored yet.To address these issues, we propose a novel model. Synergistic Alternating Aggregation Transformer (SAAT), which can better utilize the potential information of features. In SAAT, we introduce the Efficient Channel & Window Synergistic Attention Group (CWSAG) and the Spatial & Window Synergistic Attention Group (SWSAG). On the one hand, CWSAG combines efficient channel attention with shifted window attention, enhancing non-local feature fusion, and producing more visually appealing results. On the other hand, SWSAG leverages spatial attention to capture rich structured feature information, thereby enabling SAAT to more effectively extract structural features.Extensive experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of SAAT in the field of super-resolution. SAAT achieves performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) under the same quantity of parameters.

Abstract: Creating systems that are aligned with our goals is seen as a leading approach to create safe and beneficial AI in both leading AI companies and the academic field of AI safety. We defend the view that misaligned AGI - future, generally intelligent (robotic) AI agents - poses catastrophic risks. At the same time, we support the view that aligned AGI creates a substantial risk of catastrophic misuse by humans. While both risks are severe and stand in tension with one another, we show that - in principle - there is room for alignment approaches which do not increase misuse risk. We then investigate how the tradeoff between misalignment and misuse looks empirically for different technical approaches to AI alignment. Here, we argue that many current alignment techniques and foreseeable improvements thereof plausibly increase risks of catastrophic misuse. Since the impacts of AI depend on the social context, we close by discussing important social factors and suggest that to reduce the risk of a misuse catastrophe due to aligned AGI, techniques such as robustness, AI control methods and especially good governance seem essential.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has achieved significant milestones, but sample efficiency remains a bottleneck for real-world applications. Recently, CrossQ has demonstrated state-of-the-art sample efficiency with a low update-to-data (UTD) ratio of 1. In this work, we explore CrossQ's scaling behavior with higher UTD ratios. We identify challenges in the training dynamics which are emphasized by higher UTDs, particularly Q-bias explosion and the growing magnitude of critic network weights. To address this, we integrate weight normalization into the CrossQ framework, a solution that stabilizes training, prevents potential loss of plasticity and keeps the effective learning rate constant. Our proposed approach reliably scales with increasing UTD ratios, achieving competitive or superior performance across a range of challenging tasks on the DeepMind control benchmark, notably the complex dog and humanoid environments. This work eliminates the need for drastic interventions, such as network resets, and offers a robust pathway for improving sample efficiency and scalability in model-free reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of Artificial Intelligence. However, their deployment is resource-intensive, not only due to the large number of model parameters but also because the (Key-Value) KV cache consumes a lot of memory during inference. While several works propose reducing the KV cache by evicting the unnecessary tokens, these approaches rely on accumulated attention score as eviction score to quantify the importance of the token. We identify the accumulated attention score is biased and it decreases with the position of the tokens in the mathematical expectation. As a result, the retained tokens concentrate on the initial positions, limiting model's access to global contextual information. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive holistic attention KV (AhaKV), it addresses the bias of the accumulated attention score by adaptively tuning the scale of softmax according the expectation of information entropy of attention scores. To make use of the holistic attention information in self-attention mechanism, AhaKV utilize the information of value vectors, which is overlooked in previous works, to refine the adaptive score. We show theoretically that our method is well suited for bias reduction. We deployed AhaKV on different models with a fixed cache budget. Experiments show that AhaKV successfully mitigates bias and retains crucial tokens across global context and achieve state-of-the-art results against other related work on several benchmark tasks.

<title>When Does Closeness in Distribution Imply Representational Similarity? An Identifiability Perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When and why representations learned by different deep neural networks are similar is an active research topic. We choose to address these questions from the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models, we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar representations. We prove that a small Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations are similar. This has the important corollary that models arbitrarily close to maximizing the likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations, a phenomenon mirrored in our empirical observations on models trained on CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and have more similar representations. Our results establish a link between closeness in distribution and representational similarity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown to be effective evaluators across various domains such as machine translations or the scientific domain. Current LLM-as-a-Judge approaches rely mostly on individual assessments or a single round of pairwise assessments, preventing the judge LLM from developing a global ranking perspective. To address this, we present Knockout Assessment, an LLM-asa Judge method using a knockout tournament system with iterative pairwise comparisons. Experiments across three LLMs on two datasets show that knockout assessment improves scoring accuracy, increasing Pearson correlation with expert evaluations by 0.07 on average for university-level exam scoring and machine translation evaluations, aligning LLM assessments more closely with human scoring.

<title>Multi-objective Aligned Bidword Generation Model for E-commerce Search Advertising</title>

Abstract: Retrieval systems primarily address the challenge of matching user queries with the most relevant advertisements, playing a crucial role in e-commerce search advertising. The diversity of user needs and expressions often produces massive long-tail queries that cannot be matched with merchant bidwords or product titles, which results in some advertisements not being recalled, ultimately harming user experience and search efficiency. Existing query rewriting research focuses on various methods such as query log mining, query-bidword vector matching, or generation-based rewriting. However, these methods often fail to simultaneously optimize the relevance and authenticity of the user's original query and rewrite and maximize the revenue potential of recalled ads.
  In this paper, we propose a Multi-objective aligned Bidword Generation Model (MoBGM), which is composed of a discriminator, generator, and preference alignment module, to address these challenges. To simultaneously improve the relevance and authenticity of the query and rewrite and maximize the platform revenue, we design a discriminator to optimize these key objectives. Using the feedback signal of the discriminator, we train a multi-objective aligned bidword generator that aims to maximize the combined effect of the three objectives. Extensive offline and online experiments show that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the state of the art. After deployment, the algorithm has created huge commercial value for the platform, further verifying its feasibility and robustness.

Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconducting materials holds great significance for human industry and daily life. In recent years, research on predicting superconducting transition temperatures using artificial intelligence~(AI) has gained popularity, with most of these tools claiming to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the lack of widely accepted benchmark datasets in this field has severely hindered fair comparisons between different AI algorithms and impeded further advancement of these methods. In this work, we present the HTSC-2025, an ambient-pressure high-temperature superconducting benchmark dataset. This comprehensive compilation encompasses theoretically predicted superconducting materials discovered by theoretical physicists from 2023 to 2025 based on BCS superconductivity theory, including the renowned X$_2$YH$_6$ system, perovskite MXH$_3$ system, M$_3$XH$_8$ system, cage-like BCN-doped metal atomic systems derived from LaH$_{10}$ structural evolution, and two-dimensional honeycomb-structured systems evolving from MgB$_2$. The HTSC-2025 benchmark has been open-sourced at https://github.com/xqh19970407/HTSC-2025 and will be continuously updated. This benchmark holds significant importance for accelerating the discovery of superconducting materials using AI-based methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints is a long-standing challenge with wide applications. Recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian sparse-view reconstruction methods provide an efficient solution for real-time novel view synthesis by leveraging geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets and computing 3D Gaussian centers via back-projection. Despite offering strong geometric cues, both feed-forward multi-view depth estimation and flow-depth joint estimation face key limitations: the former suffers from mislocation and artifact issues in low-texture or repetitive regions, while the latter is prone to local noise and global inconsistency due to unreliable matches when ground-truth flow supervision is unavailable. To overcome this, we propose JointSplat, a unified framework that leverages the complementarity between optical flow and depth via a novel probabilistic optimization mechanism. Specifically, this pixel-level mechanism scales the information fusion between depth and flow based on the matching probability of optical flow during training. Building upon the above mechanism, we further propose a novel multi-view depth-consistency loss to leverage the reliability of supervision while suppressing misleading gradients in uncertain areas. Evaluated on RealEstate10K and ACID, JointSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed probabilistic joint flow-depth optimization approach for high-fidelity sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have led to the emergence of routing techniques, which aim to efficiently select the optimal LLM from diverse candidates to tackle specific tasks, optimizing performance while reducing costs. Current LLM routing methods are limited in effectiveness due to insufficient exploration of the intrinsic connection between user queries and the characteristics of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper, we present RadialRouter, a novel framework for LLM routing which employs a lightweight Transformer-based backbone with a radial structure named RadialFormer to articulate the query-LLMs relationship. The optimal LLM selection is performed based on the final states of RadialFormer. The pipeline is further refined by an objective function that combines Kullback-Leibler divergence with the query-query contrastive loss to enhance robustness. Experimental results on RouterBench show that RadialRouter significantly outperforms existing routing methods by 9.2\% and 5.8\% in the Balance and Cost First scenarios, respectively. Additionally, its adaptability toward different performance-cost trade-offs and the dynamic LLM pool demonstrates practical application potential.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in multimodal understanding, yet their susceptibility to perturbations poses a significant threat to their reliability in real-world applications. Despite often being imperceptible to humans, these perturbations can drastically alter model outputs, leading to erroneous interpretations and decisions. This paper introduces DiffCAP, a novel diffusion-based purification strategy that can effectively neutralize adversarial corruptions in VLMs. We observe that adding minimal noise to an adversarially corrupted image significantly alters its latent embedding with respect to VLMs. Building on this insight, DiffCAP cumulatively injects random Gaussian noise into adversarially perturbed input data. This process continues until the embeddings of two consecutive noisy images reach a predefined similarity threshold, indicating a potential approach to neutralize the adversarial effect. Subsequently, a pretrained diffusion model is employed to denoise the stabilized image, recovering a clean representation suitable for the VLMs to produce an output. Through extensive experiments across six datasets with three VLMs under varying attack strengths in three task scenarios, we show that DiffCAP consistently outperforms existing defense techniques by a substantial margin. Notably, DiffCAP significantly reduces both hyperparameter tuning complexity and the required diffusion time, thereby accelerating the denoising process. Equipped with strong theoretical and empirical support, DiffCAP provides a robust and practical solution for securely deploying VLMs in adversarial environments.

Abstract: During a conversation, there can come certain moments where its outcome hangs in the balance. In these pivotal moments, how one responds can put the conversation on substantially different trajectories leading to significantly different outcomes. Systems that can detect when such moments arise could assist conversationalists in domains with highly consequential outcomes, such as mental health crisis counseling.
  In this work, we introduce an unsupervised computational method for detecting such pivotal moments as they happen, in an online fashion. Our approach relies on the intuition that a moment is pivotal if our expectation of the outcome varies widely depending on what might be said next. By applying our method to crisis counseling conversations, we first validate it by showing that it aligns with human perception -- counselors take significantly longer to respond during moments detected by our method -- and with the eventual conversational trajectory -- which is more likely to change course at these times. We then use our framework to explore the relation of the counselor's response during pivotal moments with the eventual outcome of the session.

Abstract: As AI evolves, collaboration among heterogeneous models helps overcome data scarcity by enabling knowledge transfer across institutions and devices. Traditional Federated Learning (FL) only supports homogeneous models, limiting collaboration among clients with heterogeneous model architectures. To address this, Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL) methods are developed to enable collaboration across diverse heterogeneous models while tackling the data heterogeneity issue at the same time. However, a comprehensive benchmark for standardized evaluation and analysis of the rapidly growing HtFL methods is lacking. Firstly, the highly varied datasets, model heterogeneity scenarios, and different method implementations become hurdles to making easy and fair comparisons among HtFL methods. Secondly, the effectiveness and robustness of HtFL methods are under-explored in various scenarios, such as the medical domain and sensor signal modality. To fill this gap, we introduce the first Heterogeneous Federated Learning Library (HtFLlib), an easy-to-use and extensible framework that integrates multiple datasets and model heterogeneity scenarios, offering a robust benchmark for research and practical applications. Specifically, HtFLlib integrates (1) 12 datasets spanning various domains, modalities, and data heterogeneity scenarios; (2) 40 model architectures, ranging from small to large, across three modalities; (3) a modularized and easy-to-extend HtFL codebase with implementations of 10 representative HtFL methods; and (4) systematic evaluations in terms of accuracy, convergence, computation costs, and communication costs. We emphasize the advantages and potential of state-of-the-art HtFL methods and hope that HtFLlib will catalyze advancing HtFL research and enable its broader applications. The code is released at https://github.com/TsingZ0/HtFLlib.

Abstract: Utilizing the complex inter-variable causal relationships within multivariate time-series provides a promising avenue toward more robust and reliable multivariate time-series anomaly detection (MTSAD) but remains an underexplored area of research. This paper proposes Causality-Aware contrastive learning for RObust multivariate Time-Series (CAROTS), a novel MTSAD pipeline that incorporates the notion of causality into contrastive learning. CAROTS employs two data augmentors to obtain causality-preserving and -disturbing samples that serve as a wide range of normal variations and synthetic anomalies, respectively. With causality-preserving and -disturbing samples as positives and negatives, CAROTS performs contrastive learning to train an encoder whose latent space separates normal and abnormal samples based on causality. Moreover, CAROTS introduces a similarity-filtered one-class contrastive loss that encourages the contrastive learning process to gradually incorporate more semantically diverse samples with common causal relationships. Extensive experiments on five real-world and two synthetic datasets validate that the integration of causal relationships endows CAROTS with improved MTSAD capabilities. The code is available at https://github.com/kimanki/CAROTS.

Abstract: Performance predictors have emerged as a promising method to accelerate the evaluation stage of neural architecture search (NAS). These predictors estimate the performance of unseen architectures by learning from the correlation between a small set of trained architectures and their performance. However, most existing predictors ignore the inherent distribution shift between limited training samples and diverse test samples. Hence, they tend to learn spurious correlations as shortcuts to predictions, leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose a Causality-guided Architecture Representation Learning (CARL) method aiming to separate critical (causal) and redundant (non-causal) features of architectures for generalizable architecture performance prediction. Specifically, we employ a substructure extractor to split the input architecture into critical and redundant substructures in the latent space. Then, we generate multiple interventional samples by pairing critical representations with diverse redundant representations to prioritize critical features. Extensive experiments on five NAS search spaces demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy and superior interpretability of CARL.

<title>TransClean: Finding False Positives in Multi-Source Entity Matching under Real-World Conditions via Transitive Consistency</title>

Abstract: We present TransClean, a method for detecting false positive predictions of entity matching algorithms under real-world conditions characterized by large-scale, noisy, and unlabeled multi-source datasets that undergo distributional shifts. TransClean is explicitly designed to operate with multiple data sources in an efficient, robust and fast manner while accounting for edge cases and requiring limited manual labeling. TransClean leverages the Transitive Consistency of a matching, a measure of the consistency of a pairwise matching model f_theta on the matching it produces G_f_theta, based both on its predictions on directly evaluated record pairs and its predictions on implied record pairs. TransClean iteratively modifies a matching through gradually removing false positive matches while removing as few true positive matches as possible. In each of these steps, the estimation of the Transitive Consistency is exclusively done through model evaluations and produces quantities that can be used as proxies of the amounts of true and false positives in the matching while not requiring any manual labeling, producing an estimate of the quality of the matching and indicating which record groups are likely to contain false positives. In our experiments, we compare combining TransClean with a naively trained pairwise matching model (DistilBERT) and with a state-of-the-art end-to-end matching method (CLER) and illustrate the flexibility of TransClean in being able to detect most of the false positives of either setup across a variety of datasets. Our experiments show that TransClean induces an average +24.42 F1 score improvement for entity matching in a multi-source setting when compared to traditional pair-wise matching algorithms.

Abstract: Expressive voice conversion aims to transfer both speaker identity and expressive attributes from a target speech to a given source speech. In this work, we improve over a self-supervised, non-autoregressive framework with a conditional variational autoencoder, focusing on reducing source timbre leakage and improving linguistic-acoustic disentanglement for better style transfer. To minimize style leakage, we use multilingual discrete speech units for content representation and reinforce embeddings with augmentation-based similarity loss and mix-style layer normalization. To enhance expressivity transfer, we incorporate local F0 information via cross-attention and extract style embeddings enriched with global pitch and energy features. Experiments show our model outperforms baselines in emotion and speaker similarity, demonstrating superior style adaptation and reduced source style leakage.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful information handling capabilities and are widely integrated into chatbot applications. OpenAI provides a platform for developers to construct custom GPTs, extending ChatGPT's functions and integrating external services. Since its release in November 2023, over 3 million custom GPTs have been created. However, such a vast ecosystem also conceals security and privacy threats. For developers, instruction leaking attacks threaten the intellectual property of instructions in custom GPTs through carefully crafted adversarial prompts. For users, unwanted data access behavior by custom GPTs or integrated third-party services raises significant privacy concerns. To systematically evaluate the scope of threats in real-world LLM applications, we develop three phases instruction leaking attacks target GPTs with different defense level. Our widespread experiments on 10,000 real-world custom GPTs reveal that over 98.8% of GPTs are vulnerable to instruction leaking attacks via one or more adversarial prompts, and half of the remaining GPTs can also be attacked through multiround conversations. We also developed a framework to assess the effectiveness of defensive strategies and identify unwanted behaviors in custom GPTs. Our findings show that 77.5% of custom GPTs with defense strategies are vulnerable to basic instruction leaking attacks. Additionally, we reveal that 738 custom GPTs collect user conversational information, and identified 8 GPTs exhibiting data access behaviors that are unnecessary for their intended functionalities. Our findings raise awareness among GPT developers about the importance of integrating specific defensive strategies in their instructions and highlight users' concerns about data privacy when using LLM-based applications.

Abstract: Developing safety-critical automotive software presents significant challenges due to increasing system complexity and strict regulatory demands. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The framework uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate code generation in languages such as C++, incorporating safety-focused practices such as static verification, test-driven development and iterative refinement. A feedback-driven pipeline ensures the integration of test, simulation and verification for compliance with safety standards. The framework is validated through the development of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. Comparative benchmarking of LLMs ensures optimal model selection for accuracy and reliability. Results demonstrate that the framework enables automatic code generation while ensuring compliance with safety-critical requirements, systematically integrating GenAI into automotive software engineering. This work advances the use of AI in safety-critical domains, bridging the gap between state-of-the-art generative models and real-world safety requirements.

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment than existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9% on Object-HalBench and 49.8% on MM-HalBench.

Abstract: Automated counter-narratives (CN) offer a promising strategy for mitigating online hate speech, yet concerns about their affective tone, accessibility, and ethical risks remain. We propose a framework for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM)-generated CNs across four dimensions: persona framing, verbosity and readability, affective tone, and ethical robustness. Using GPT-4o-Mini, Cohere's CommandR-7B, and Meta's LLaMA 3.1-70B, we assess three prompting strategies on the MT-Conan and HatEval datasets. Our findings reveal that LLM-generated CNs are often verbose and adapted for people with college-level literacy, limiting their accessibility. While emotionally guided prompts yield more empathetic and readable responses, there remain concerns surrounding safety and effectiveness.

Abstract: Generative models, especially large language models (LLMs), have shown remarkable progress in producing text that appears human-like. However, they often exhibit patterns that make their output easier to detect than text written by humans. In this paper, we investigate how explainable AI (XAI) methods can be used to reduce the detectability of AI-generated text (AIGT) while also introducing a robust ensemble-based detection approach. We begin by training an ensemble classifier to distinguish AIGT from human-written text, then apply SHAP and LIME to identify tokens that most strongly influence its predictions. We propose four explainability-based token replacement strategies to modify these influential tokens. Our findings show that these token replacement approaches can significantly diminish a single classifier's ability to detect AIGT. However, our ensemble classifier maintains strong performance across multiple languages and domains, showing that a multi-model approach can mitigate the impact of token-level manipulations. These results show that XAI methods can make AIGT harder to detect by focusing on the most influential tokens. At the same time, they highlight the need for robust, ensemble-based detection strategies that can adapt to evolving approaches for hiding AIGT.

<title>High Accuracy, Less Talk (HALT): Reliable LLMs through Capability-Aligned Finetuning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently respond to every prompt. However, they can produce incorrect answers when they lack knowledge or capability -- a problem known as hallucination. We instead propose post-training an LLM to generate content only when confident in its correctness and to otherwise (partially) abstain. Specifically, our method, HALT, produces capability-aligned post-training data that encodes what the model can and cannot reliably generate. We generate this data by splitting responses of the pretrained LLM into factual fragments (atomic statements or reasoning steps), and use ground truth information to identify incorrect fragments. We achieve capability-aligned finetuning responses by either removing incorrect fragments or replacing them with "Unsure from Here" -- according to a tunable threshold that allows practitioners to trade off response completeness and mean correctness of the response's fragments. We finetune four open-source models for biography writing, mathematics, coding, and medicine with HALT for three different trade-off thresholds. HALT effectively trades off response completeness for correctness, increasing the mean correctness of response fragments by 15% on average, while resulting in a 4% improvement in the F1 score (mean of completeness and correctness of the response) compared to the relevant baselines. By tuning HALT for highest correctness, we train a single reliable Llama3-70B model with correctness increased from 51% to 87% across all four domains while maintaining 53% of the response completeness achieved with standard finetuning.

Abstract: An essential step in deploying medical imaging models is ensuring alignment with clinical knowledge and interpretability. We focus on mapping clinical concepts into the latent space of generative models to identify Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs). Using a simple reconstruction autoencoder, we link user-defined concepts to image-level features without explicit label training. The extracted concepts are stable across datasets, enabling visual explanations that highlight clinically relevant features. By traversing latent space along concept directions, we produce counterfactuals that exaggerate or reduce specific clinical features. Preliminary results on chest X-rays show promise for large pathologies like cardiomegaly, while smaller pathologies remain challenging due to reconstruction limits. Although not outperforming baselines, this approach offers a path toward interpretable, concept-based explanations aligned with clinical knowledge.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

Abstract: Tabular reasoning involves multi-step information extraction and logical inference over tabular data. While recent advances have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for reasoning over structured tables, such high-quality textual representations are often unavailable in real-world settings, where tables typically appear as images. In this paper, we tackle the task of tabular reasoning from table images, leveraging privileged structured information available during training to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The key challenges lie in the complexity of accurately aligning structured information with visual representations, and in effectively transferring structured reasoning skills to MLLMs despite the input modality gap. To address these, we introduce TabUlar Reasoning with Bridged infOrmation ({\sc Turbo}), a new framework for multimodal tabular reasoning with privileged structured tables. {\sc Turbo} benefits from a structure-aware reasoning trace generator based on DeepSeek-R1, contributing to high-quality modality-bridged data. On this basis, {\sc Turbo} repeatedly generates and selects the advantageous reasoning paths, further enhancing the model's tabular reasoning ability. Experimental results demonstrate that, with limited ($9$k) data, {\sc Turbo} achieves state-of-the-art performance ($+7.2\%$ vs. previous SOTA) across multiple datasets.

Abstract: As a part of an embodied agent, Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 1000 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents, and task plans, for a total of 2000 tasks. We hope that AmbiK will enable researchers to perform a unified comparison of ambiguity detection methods. AmbiK is available at https://github.com/cog-model/AmbiK-dataset.

Abstract: We present TextAtari, a benchmark for evaluating language agents on very long-horizon decision-making tasks spanning up to 100,000 steps. By translating the visual state representations of classic Atari games into rich textual descriptions, TextAtari creates a challenging test bed that bridges sequential decision-making with natural language processing. The benchmark includes nearly 100 distinct tasks with varying complexity, action spaces, and planning horizons, all rendered as text through an unsupervised representation learning framework (AtariARI). We evaluate three open-source large language models (Qwen2.5-7B, Gemma-7B, and Llama3.1-8B) across three agent frameworks (zero-shot, few-shot chain-of-thought, and reflection reasoning) to assess how different forms of prior knowledge affect performance on these long-horizon challenges. Four scenarios-Basic, Obscured, Manual Augmentation, and Reference-based-investigate the impact of semantic understanding, instruction comprehension, and expert demonstrations on agent decision-making. Our results reveal significant performance gaps between language agents and human players in extensive planning tasks, highlighting challenges in sequential reasoning, state tracking, and strategic planning across tens of thousands of steps. TextAtari provides standardized evaluation protocols, baseline implementations, and a framework for advancing research at the intersection of language models and planning.

Abstract: In medical imaging, 4D MRI enables dynamic 3D visualization, yet the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution requires prolonged scan time that can compromise temporal fidelity--especially during rapid, large-amplitude motion. Traditional approaches typically rely on registration-based interpolation to generate intermediate frames. However, these methods struggle with large deformations, resulting in misregistration, artifacts, and diminished spatial consistency. To address these challenges, we propose TSSC-Net, a novel framework that generates intermediate frames while preserving spatial consistency. To improve temporal fidelity under fast motion, our diffusion-based temporal super-resolution network generates intermediate frames using the start and end frames as key references, achieving 6x temporal super-resolution in a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a novel tri-directional Mamba-based module that leverages long-range contextual information to effectively resolve spatial inconsistencies arising from cross-slice misalignment, thereby enhancing volumetric coherence and correcting cross-slice errors. Extensive experiments were performed on the public ACDC cardiac MRI dataset and a real-world dynamic 4D knee joint dataset. The results demonstrate that TSSC-Net can generate high-resolution dynamic MRI from fast-motion data while preserving structural fidelity and spatial consistency.

Abstract: Over the past decade, Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has achieved significant performance improvements and holds great promise for future developments. This paper presents a comprehensive study on MIS based on DNNs. Intelligent Vision Systems are often evaluated based on their output levels, such as Data, Information, Knowledge, Intelligence, and Wisdom (DIKIW),and the state-of-the-art solutions in MIS at these levels are the focus of research. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an important research direction, as it aims to uncover the "black box" nature of previous DNN architectures to meet the requirements of transparency and ethics. The study emphasizes the importance of MIS in disease diagnosis and early detection, particularly for increasing the survival rate of cancer patients through timely diagnosis. XAI and early prediction are considered two important steps in the journey from "intelligence" to "wisdom." Additionally, the paper addresses existing challenges and proposes potential solutions to enhance the efficiency of implementing DNN-based MIS.

Abstract: Courtrooms are places where lives are determined and fates are sealed, yet they are not impervious to manipulation. Strategic use of manipulation in legal jargon can sway the opinions of judges and affect the decisions. Despite the growing advancements in NLP, its application in detecting and analyzing manipulation within the legal domain remains largely unexplored. Our work addresses this gap by introducing LegalCon, a dataset of 1,063 annotated courtroom conversations labeled for manipulation detection, identification of primary manipulators, and classification of manipulative techniques, with a focus on long conversations. Furthermore, we propose CLAIM, a two-stage, Intent-driven Multi-agent framework designed to enhance manipulation analysis by enabling context-aware and informed decision-making. Our results highlight the potential of incorporating agentic frameworks to improve fairness and transparency in judicial processes. We hope that this contributes to the broader application of NLP in legal discourse analysis and the development of robust tools to support fairness in legal decision-making. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Disha1001/CLAIM.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into plant bioelectric responses to human presence and emotional states, building on five years of systematic research. Using custom-built plant sensors and machine learning classification, we demonstrate that plants generate distinct bioelectric signals correlating with human proximity, emotional states, and physiological conditions. A deep learning model based on ResNet50 architecture achieved 97% accuracy in classifying human emotional states through plant voltage spectrograms, while control models with shuffled labels achieved only 30% accuracy. This study synthesizes findings from multiple experiments spanning 2020-2025, including individual recognition (66% accuracy), eurythmic gesture detection, stress prediction, and responses to human voice and movement. We propose that these phenomena represent evolved anti-herbivory early warning systems, where plants detect approaching animals through bioelectric field changes before physical contact. Our results challenge conventional understanding of plant sensory capabilities and suggest practical applications in agriculture, healthcare, and human-plant interaction research.

Although there have been many works to solve this problem, there are still remaining challenges such as large-scale datasets, imbalanced data, viewpoint, fine grained data (attributes), the Local Features are not employed at semantic level in online stage of Re-ID task, furthermore, the imbalanced data problem of attributes are not taken into consideration. This paper has proposed a Unified Re-ID system consisted of three main modules such as Pedestrian Attribute Ontology (PAO), Local Multi-task DCNN (Local MDCNN), Imbalance Data Solver (IDS). The new main point of our Re-ID system is the power of mutual support of PAO, Local MDCNN and IDS to exploit the inner-group correlations of attributes and pre-filter the mismatch candidates from Gallery set based on semantic information as Fashion Attributes and Facial Attributes, to solve the imbalanced data of attributes without adjusting network architecture and data augmentation. We experimented on the well-known Market1501 dataset. The experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our Re-ID system and it could achieve the higher performance on Market1501 dataset in comparison to some state-of-the-art Re-ID methods.

Abstract: Building capable household and industrial robots requires mastering the control of versatile, high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems such as mobile manipulators. While reinforcement learning (RL) holds promise for autonomously acquiring robot control policies, scaling it to high-DoF embodiments remains challenging. Direct RL in the real world demands both safe exploration and high sample efficiency, which are difficult to achieve in practice. Sim-to-real RL, on the other hand, is often brittle due to the reality gap. This paper introduces SLAC, a method that renders real-world RL feasible for complex embodiments by leveraging a low-fidelity simulator to pretrain a task-agnostic latent action space. SLAC trains this latent action space via a customized unsupervised skill discovery method designed to promote temporal abstraction, disentanglement, and safety, thereby facilitating efficient downstream learning. Once a latent action space is learned, SLAC uses it as the action interface for a novel off-policy RL algorithm to autonomously learn downstream tasks through real-world interactions. We evaluate SLAC against existing methods on a suite of bimanual mobile manipulation tasks, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, SLAC learns contact-rich whole-body tasks in under an hour of real-world interactions, without relying on any demonstrations or hand-crafted behavior priors.

Abstract: In this work, we study the scalability of offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. In principle, a truly scalable offline RL algorithm should be able to solve any given problem, regardless of its complexity, given sufficient data, compute, and model capacity. We investigate if and how current offline RL algorithms match up to this promise on diverse, challenging, previously unsolved tasks, using datasets up to 1000x larger than typical offline RL datasets. We observe that despite scaling up data, many existing offline RL algorithms exhibit poor scaling behavior, saturating well below the maximum performance. We hypothesize that the horizon is the main cause behind the poor scaling of offline RL. We empirically verify this hypothesis through several analysis experiments, showing that long horizons indeed present a fundamental barrier to scaling up offline RL. We then show that various horizon reduction techniques substantially enhance scalability on challenging tasks. Based on our insights, we also introduce a minimal yet scalable method named SHARSA that effectively reduces the horizon. SHARSA achieves the best asymptotic performance and scaling behavior among our evaluation methods, showing that explicitly reducing the horizon unlocks the scalability of offline RL.

Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been applied to physical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs), offering scalable simulation and uncertainty-aware inference. However, enforcing physical constraints, such as conservation laws (linear and nonlinear) and physical consistencies, remains challenging. Existing methods often rely on soft penalties or architectural biases that fail to guarantee hard constraints. In this work, we propose Physics-Constrained Flow Matching (PCFM), a zero-shot inference framework that enforces arbitrary nonlinear constraints in pretrained flow-based generative models. PCFM continuously guides the sampling process through physics-based corrections applied to intermediate solution states, while remaining aligned with the learned flow and satisfying physical constraints. Empirically, PCFM outperforms both unconstrained and constrained baselines on a range of PDEs, including those with shocks, discontinuities, and sharp features, while ensuring exact constraint satisfaction at the final solution. Our method provides a general framework for enforcing hard constraints in both scientific and general-purpose generative models, especially in applications where constraint satisfaction is essential.

Abstract: Geometry optimization of atomic structures is a common and crucial task in computational chemistry and materials design. Following the learning to optimize paradigm, we propose a new multi-agent reinforcement learning method called Multi-Agent Crystal Structure optimization (MACS) to address periodic crystal structure optimization. MACS treats geometry optimization as a partially observable Markov game in which atoms are agents that adjust their positions to collectively discover a stable configuration. We train MACS across various compositions of reported crystalline materials to obtain a policy that successfully optimizes structures from the training compositions as well as structures of larger sizes and unseen compositions, confirming its excellent scalability and zero-shot transferability. We benchmark our approach against a broad range of state-of-the-art optimization methods and demonstrate that MACS optimizes periodic crystal structures significantly faster, with fewer energy calculations, and the lowest failure rate.

Abstract: Long context large language models (LLMs) are deployed in many real-world applications such as RAG, agent, and broad LLM-integrated applications. Given an instruction and a long context (e.g., documents, PDF files, webpages), a long context LLM can generate an output grounded in the provided context, aiming to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and verifiable outputs while reducing hallucinations and unsupported claims. This raises a research question: how to pinpoint the texts (e.g., sentences, passages, or paragraphs) in the context that contribute most to or are responsible for the generated output by an LLM? This process, which we call context traceback, has various real-world applications, such as 1) debugging LLM-based systems, 2) conducting post-attack forensic analysis for attacks (e.g., prompt injection attack, knowledge corruption attacks) to an LLM, and 3) highlighting knowledge sources to enhance the trust of users towards outputs generated by LLMs. When applied to context traceback for long context LLMs, existing feature attribution methods such as Shapley have sub-optimal performance and/or incur a large computational cost. In this work, we develop TracLLM, the first generic context traceback framework tailored to long context LLMs. Our framework can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing feature attribution methods. To improve the efficiency, we develop an informed search based algorithm in TracLLM. We also develop contribution score ensemble/denoising techniques to improve the accuracy of TracLLM. Our evaluation results show TracLLM can effectively identify texts in a long context that lead to the output of an LLM. Our code and data are at: https://github.com/Wang-Yanting/TracLLM.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable reasoning capabilities of Deepseek-R1 in complex textual tasks, many works attempt to incentivize similar capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning (RL). However, they still struggle to activate complex reasoning. In this paper, rather than examining multimodal RL in isolation, we delve into current training pipelines and identify three crucial phenomena: 1) Effective cold start initialization is critical for enhancing MLLM reasoning. Intriguingly, we find that initializing with carefully selected text data alone can lead to performance surpassing many recent multimodal reasoning models, even before multimodal RL. 2) Standard GRPO applied to multimodal RL suffers from gradient stagnation, which degrades training stability and performance. 3) Subsequent text-only RL training, following the multimodal RL phase, further enhances multimodal reasoning. This staged training approach effectively balances perceptual grounding and cognitive reasoning development. By incorporating the above insights and addressing multimodal RL issues, we introduce ReVisual-R1, achieving a new state-of-the-art among open-source 7B MLLMs on challenging benchmarks including MathVerse, MathVision, WeMath, LogicVista, DynaMath, and challenging AIME2024 and AIME2025.

Abstract: Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (Dec-POMDPs) are known to be NEXP-Complete and intractable to solve. However, for problems such as cooperative navigation, obstacle avoidance, and formation control, basic assumptions can be made about local visibility and local dependencies. The work DeWeese and Qu 2024 formalized these assumptions in the construction of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. In this setting, it establishes three closed-form policies that are tractable to compute in various situations and are exponentially close to optimal with respect to visibility. However, it is also shown that these solutions can have poor performance when the visibility is small and fixed, often getting stuck during simulations due to the so called "Penalty Jittering" phenomenon. In this work, we establish the Extended Cutoff Policy Class which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-trivial class of near optimal closed-form partially observable policies that are exponentially close to optimal with respect to the visibility for any Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP. These policies are able to remember agents beyond their visibilities which allows them to perform significantly better in many small and fixed visibility settings, resolve Penalty Jittering occurrences, and under certain circumstances guarantee fully observable joint optimal behavior despite the partial observability. We also propose a generalized form of the Locally Interdependent Multi-Agent MDP that allows for transition dependence and extended reward dependence, then replicate our theoretical results in this setting.

Abstract: The rapid progress of navigation, manipulation, and vision models has made mobile manipulators capable in many specialized tasks. However, the open-world mobile manipulation (OWMM) task remains a challenge due to the need for generalization to open-ended instructions and environments, as well as the systematic complexity to integrate high-level decision making with low-level robot control based on both global scene understanding and current agent state. To address this complexity, we propose a novel multi-modal agent architecture that maintains multi-view scene frames and agent states for decision-making and controls the robot by function calling. A second challenge is the hallucination from domain shift. To enhance the agent performance, we further introduce an agentic data synthesis pipeline for the OWMM task to adapt the VLM model to our task domain with instruction fine-tuning. We highlight our fine-tuned OWMM-VLM as the first dedicated foundation model for mobile manipulators with global scene understanding, robot state tracking, and multi-modal action generation in a unified model. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model achieves SOTA performance compared to other foundation models including GPT-4o and strong zero-shot generalization in real world.

Abstract: Existing evaluation paradigms for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) face critical limitations. Real-world evaluation is often challenging due to safety concerns and a lack of reproducibility, whereas closed-loop simulation can face insufficient realism or high computational costs. Open-loop evaluation, while being efficient and data-driven, relies on metrics that generally overlook compounding errors. In this paper, we propose pseudo-simulation, a novel paradigm that addresses these limitations. Pseudo-simulation operates on real datasets, similar to open-loop evaluation, but augments them with synthetic observations generated prior to evaluation using 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to approximate potential future states the AV might encounter by generating a diverse set of observations that vary in position, heading, and speed. Our method then assigns a higher importance to synthetic observations that best match the AV's likely behavior using a novel proximity-based weighting scheme. This enables evaluating error recovery and the mitigation of causal confusion, as in closed-loop benchmarks, without requiring sequential interactive simulation. We show that pseudo-simulation is better correlated with closed-loop simulations (R^2=0.8) than the best existing open-loop approach (R^2=0.7). We also establish a public leaderboard for the community to benchmark new methodologies with pseudo-simulation. Our code is available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/navsim.

Abstract: Knowledge editing methods like MEMIT are able to make data and compute efficient updates of factual knowledge by using a single sentence to update facts and their consequences. However, what is often overlooked is a "precomputation step", which requires a one-time but significant computational cost. The authors of MEMIT originally precompute approximately 44 million hidden vectors per edited layer, which requires a forward pass over 44 million tokens. For GPT-J (6B), this precomputation step takes 36 hours on a single GPU, while it takes approximately 40 hours for Llama2-7B. Additionally, this precomputation time grows with model size. In this paper, we show that this excessive computational cost is unnecessary. Knowledge editing using MEMIT and related methods, such as ROME and EMMET, can be performed by pre-computing a very small portion of the 44 million hidden vectors. We first present the theoretical minimum number of hidden vector precomputation required for solutions of these editing methods to exist. We then empirically show that knowledge editing using these methods can be done by pre-computing significantly fewer hidden vectors. Specifically, we show that the precomputation step can be done with less than 0.3% of the originally stipulated number of hidden vectors. This saves a significant amount of precomputation time and allows users to begin editing new models within a few minutes.

Abstract: Learning robot control policies from human videos is a promising direction for scaling up robot learning. However, how to extract action knowledge (or action representations) from videos for policy learning remains a key challenge. Existing action representations such as video frames, pixelflow, and pointcloud flow have inherent limitations such as modeling complexity or loss of information. In this paper, we propose to use object-centric 3D motion field to represent actions for robot learning from human videos, and present a novel framework for extracting this representation from videos for zero-shot control. We introduce two novel components in its implementation. First, a novel training pipeline for training a ''denoising'' 3D motion field estimator to extract fine object 3D motions from human videos with noisy depth robustly. Second, a dense object-centric 3D motion field prediction architecture that favors both cross-embodiment transfer and policy generalization to background. We evaluate the system in real world setups. Experiments show that our method reduces 3D motion estimation error by over 50% compared to the latest method, achieve 55% average success rate in diverse tasks where prior approaches fail~($\lesssim 10$\%), and can even acquire fine-grained manipulation skills like insertion.

Abstract: Actual real-world domains are characterised by uncertain situations in which acting and using resources may entail the embracing of risks. Performing actions in such domains involves costs of consuming some resource, such as time or energy, where the knowledge about these costs can range from known to totally unknown. In autonomous vehicles, actions have uncertain costs due to factors like traffic. Choosing an action requires assessing delay risks, as each road may have unpredictable congestion. Thus, these domains call for not only planning under uncertainty but also planning while embracing risk. Resorting to HTN planning as a widely used planning technique in real-world applications, one can observe that existing approaches assume risk neutrality, relying on single-valued action costs without considering risk. Here, we enhance HTN planning with risk awareness by considering expected utility theory. We introduce a general framework for HTN planning that allows modelling risk and uncertainty using a probability distribution of action costs upon which we define risk-aware HTN planning as being capable of accounting for the different risk attitudes and allowing the computation of plans that go beyond risk neutrality. We lay out that computing risk-aware plans requires finding plans with the highest expected utility. We argue that it is possible for HTN planning agents to solve specialised risk-aware HTN planning problems by adapting existing HTN planning approaches, and develop an approach that surpasses the expressiveness of current approaches by allowing these agents to compute plans tailored to a particular risk attitude. An empirical evaluation of two case studies highlights the feasibility and expressiveness of this approach. We also highlight open issues, such as applying the proposal beyond HTN planning, covering both modelling and plan generation.

Abstract: Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.

Abstract: Humans perceive the world through multiple senses, enabling them to create a comprehensive representation of their surroundings and to generalize information across domains. For instance, when a textual description of a scene is given, humans can mentally visualize it. In fields like robotics and Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents can also access information about the environment through multiple sensors; yet redundancy and complementarity between sensors is difficult to exploit as a source of robustness (e.g. against sensor failure) or generalization (e.g. transfer across domains). Prior research demonstrated that a robust and flexible multimodal representation can be efficiently constructed based on the cognitive science notion of a 'Global Workspace': a unique representation trained to combine information across modalities, and to broadcast its signal back to each modality. Here, we explore whether such a brain-inspired multimodal representation could be advantageous for RL agents. First, we train a 'Global Workspace' to exploit information collected about the environment via two input modalities (a visual input, or an attribute vector representing the state of the agent and/or its environment). Then, we train a RL agent policy using this frozen Global Workspace. In two distinct environments and tasks, our results reveal the model's ability to perform zero-shot cross-modal transfer between input modalities, i.e. to apply to image inputs a policy previously trained on attribute vectors (and vice-versa), without additional training or fine-tuning. Variants and ablations of the full Global Workspace (including a CLIP-like multimodal representation trained via contrastive learning) did not display the same generalization abilities.

Abstract: Advances in large models, reinforcement learning, and open-endedness have accelerated progress toward autonomous agents that can learn and interact in the real world. To achieve this, flexible tools are needed to create rich, yet computationally efficient, environments. While scalable 2D environments fail to address key real-world challenges like 3D navigation and spatial reasoning, more complex 3D environments are computationally expensive and lack features like customizability and multi-agent support. This paper introduces Craftium, a highly customizable and easy-to-use platform for building rich 3D single- and multi-agent environments. We showcase environments of different complexity and nature: from single- and multi-agent tasks to vast worlds with many creatures and biomes, and customizable procedural task generators. Benchmarking shows that Craftium significantly reduces the computational cost of alternatives of similar richness, achieving +2K steps per second more than Minecraft-based frameworks.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal large models has advanced artificial intelligence, introducing unprecedented levels of performance and functionality. However, optimizing these models remains challenging due to historically isolated paths of model-centric and data-centric developments, leading to suboptimal outcomes and inefficient resource utilization. In response, we present a new sandbox suite tailored for integrated data-model co-development. This sandbox provides a feedback-driven experimental platform, enabling cost-effective iteration and guided refinement of both data and models. Our proposed ``Probe-Analyze-Refine'' workflow, validated through practical use cases on multimodal tasks such as image-text pre-training with CLIP, image-to-text generation with LLaVA-like models, and text-to-video generation with DiT-based models, yields transferable and notable performance boosts, such as topping the VBench leaderboard. A comprehensive set of over 100 experiments demonstrated the suite's usability and extensibility, while also uncovering insights into the interplay between data quality, diversity, model behavior, and computational costs. All codes, datasets, and models are open-sourced to foster future research and applications that would otherwise be infeasible due to the lack of a dedicated co-development infrastructure.

Abstract: Guardrail, an emerging mechanism designed to ensure that large language models (LLMs) align with human values by moderating harmful or toxic responses, requires a sociotechnical approach in their design. This paper addresses a critical issue: existing guardrails lack a well-founded methodology to accommodate the diverse needs of different user groups, particularly concerning access rights. Supported by trust modeling (primarily on `social' aspect) and enhanced with online in-context learning via retrieval-augmented generation (on `technical' aspect), we introduce an adaptive guardrail mechanism, to dynamically moderate access to sensitive content based on user trust metrics. User trust metrics, defined as a novel combination of direct interaction trust and authority-verified trust, enable the system to precisely tailor the strictness of content moderation by aligning with the user's credibility and the specific context of their inquiries. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the adaptive guardrail in meeting diverse user needs, outperforming existing guardrails while securing sensitive information and precisely managing potentially hazardous content through a context-aware knowledge base. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce trust-oriented concept into a guardrail system, offering a scalable solution that enriches the discourse on ethical deployment for next-generation LLM service.

Abstract: Open-ended short-answer questions (SAGs) have been widely recognized as a powerful tool for providing deeper insights into learners' responses in the context of learning analytics (LA). However, SAGs often present challenges in practice due to the high grading workload and concerns about inconsistent assessments. With recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automatic short-answer grading (ASAG) offers a promising solution to these challenges. Despite this, current ASAG algorithms are often limited in generalizability and tend to be tailored to specific questions. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-agent ASAG framework, GradeOpt, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as graders for SAGs. More importantly, GradeOpt incorporates two additional LLM-based agents - the reflector and the refiner - into the multi-agent system. This enables GradeOpt to automatically optimize the original grading guidelines by performing self-reflection on its errors. Through experiments on a challenging ASAG task, namely the grading of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and content knowledge (CK) questions, GradeOpt demonstrates superior performance in grading accuracy and behavior alignment with human graders compared to representative baselines. Finally, comprehensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the individual components designed in GradeOpt.

Abstract: With large language models (LLMs) increasingly deployed as cognitive engines for AI agents, the reliability and effectiveness critically hinge on their intrinsic epistemic agency, which remains understudied. Epistemic agency, the ability to flexibly construct, adapt, and monitor beliefs about dynamic environments, represents a base-model-level capacity independent of specific tools, modules, or applications. We characterize the holistic process underlying epistemic agency, which unfolds in seven interrelated dimensions: prediction, decision-making, perception, memory, counterfactual thinking, belief updating, and meta-reflection. Correspondingly, we propose Reflection-Bench, a cognitive-psychology-inspired benchmark consisting of seven tasks with long-term relevance and minimization of data leakage. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 16 models using three prompting strategies, we identify a clear three-tier performance hierarchy and significant limitations of current LLMs, particularly in meta-reflection capabilities. While state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate rudimentary signs of epistemic agency, our findings suggest several promising research directions, including enhancing core cognitive functions, improving cross-functional coordination, and developing adaptive processing mechanisms. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/AI45Lab/ReflectionBench.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn suitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy, inconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such feedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended side effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore the use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the performance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation method that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward models and large-scale preference datasets. In our experiments, we demonstrate two key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common forms of labeler bias in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers to refine their strategies to align more closely with expert feedback. By quantifying the impact of human feedback on reward models, we believe that influence functions can enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in RLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

Abstract: Orthogonal convolutional layers are valuable components in multiple areas of machine learning, such as adversarial robustness, normalizing flows, GANs, and Lipschitz-constrained models. Their ability to preserve norms and ensure stable gradient propagation makes them valuable for a large range of problems. Despite their promise, the deployment of orthogonal convolution in large-scale applications is a significant challenge due to computational overhead and limited support for modern features like strides, dilations, group convolutions, and transposed convolutions. In this paper, we introduce AOC (Adaptative Orthogonal Convolution), a scalable method that extends a previous method (BCOP), effectively overcoming existing limitations in the construction of orthogonal convolutions. This advancement unlocks the construction of architectures that were previously considered impractical. We demonstrate through our experiments that our method produces expressive models that become increasingly efficient as they scale. To foster further advancement, we provide an open-source python package implementing this method, called Orthogonium ( https://github.com/deel-ai/orthogonium ) .

Abstract: Agents for computer use (ACUs) are an emerging class of systems capable of executing complex tasks on digital devices - such as desktops, mobile phones, and web platforms - given instructions in natural language. These agents can automate tasks by controlling software via low-level actions like mouse clicks and touchscreen gestures. However, despite rapid progress, ACUs are not yet mature for everyday use.
  In this survey, we investigate the state-of-the-art, trends, and research gaps in the development of practical ACUs. We provide a comprehensive review of the ACU landscape, introducing a unifying taxonomy spanning three dimensions: (I) the domain perspective, characterizing agent operating contexts; (II) the interaction perspective, describing observation modalities (e.g., screenshots, HTML) and action modalities (e.g., mouse, keyboard, code execution); and (III) the agent perspective, detailing how agents perceive, reason, and learn.
  We review 87 ACUs and 33 datasets across foundation model-based and classical approaches through this taxonomy. Our analysis identifies six major research gaps: insufficient generalization, inefficient learning, limited planning, low task complexity in benchmarks, non-standardized evaluation, and a disconnect between research and practical conditions.
  To address these gaps, we advocate for: (a) vision-based observations and low-level control to enhance generalization; (b) adaptive learning beyond static prompting; (c) effective planning and reasoning methods and models; (d) benchmarks that reflect real-world task complexity; (e) standardized evaluation based on task success; (f) aligning agent design with real-world deployment constraints.
  Together, our taxonomy and analysis establish a foundation for advancing ACU research toward general-purpose agents for robust and scalable computer use.

Abstract: IQ testing has served as a foundational methodology for evaluating human cognitive capabilities, deliberately decoupling assessment from linguistic background, language proficiency, or domain-specific knowledge to isolate core competencies in abstraction and reasoning. Yet, artificial intelligence research currently lacks systematic benchmarks to quantify these critical cognitive capabilities in multimodal systems. To address this crucial gap, we propose MM-IQ, a comprehensive evaluation framework, which comprises a large-scale training set with 4,776 visual reasoning problems and 2,710 meticulously curated test items spanning 8 distinct reasoning paradigms. Through systematic evaluation of existing open-source and proprietary multimodal models, our benchmark reveals striking limitations: even state-of-the-art architectures achieve only marginally superior performance to random chance (33.17% vs. 25% baseline accuracy). This substantial performance chasm highlights the inadequacy of current multimodal models in approximating fundamental human reasoning capacities, underscoring the need for paradigm-shifting advancements to bridge this cognitive divide. Moreover, inspired by the recent surge of large reasoning models, we also release a multimodal reasoning model as the baseline that is trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable reward functions, reaching competitive performance to the state-of-the-art with a notably smaller model size.

Abstract: Misinformation can be countered with fact-checking, but the process is costly and slow. Identifying checkworthy claims is the first step, where automation can help scale fact-checkers' efforts. However, detection methods struggle with content that is (1) multimodal, (2) from diverse domains, and (3) synthetic. We introduce HintsOfTruth, a public dataset for multimodal checkworthiness detection with 27K real-world and synthetic image/claim pairs. The mix of real and synthetic data makes this dataset unique and ideal for benchmarking detection methods. We compare fine-tuned and prompted Large Language Models (LLMs). We find that well-configured lightweight text-based encoders perform comparably to multimodal models but the former only focus on identifying non-claim-like content. Multimodal LLMs can be more accurate but come at a significant computational cost, making them impractical for large-scale applications. When faced with synthetic data, multimodal models perform more robustly.

Abstract: This work presents a first evaluation of two state-of-the-art Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek R1, on analogical reasoning, focusing on well-established nonverbal human IQ tests based on Raven's progressive matrices. We benchmark with the I-RAVEN dataset and its extension, I-RAVEN-X, which tests the ability to generalize to longer reasoning rules and ranges of the attribute values. To assess the influence of visual uncertainties on these symbolic analogical reasoning tests, we extend the I-RAVEN-X dataset, which otherwise assumes an oracle perception. We adopt a two-fold strategy to simulate this imperfect visual perception: 1) we introduce confounding attributes which, being sampled at random, do not contribute to the prediction of the correct answer of the puzzles, and 2) we smoothen the distributions of the input attributes' values. We observe a sharp decline in OpenAI's o3-mini task accuracy, dropping from 86.6% on the original I-RAVEN to just 17.0% -- approaching random chance -- on the more challenging I-RAVEN-X, which increases input length and range and emulates perceptual uncertainty. This drop occurred despite spending 3.4x more reasoning tokens. A similar trend is also observed for DeepSeek R1: from 80.6% to 23.2%. On the other hand, a neuro-symbolic probabilistic abductive model, ARLC, that achieves state-of-the-art performances on I-RAVEN, can robustly reason under all these out-of-distribution tests, maintaining strong accuracy with only a modest accuracy reduction from 98.6% to 88.0%.

<title>A Formalism for Optimal Search with Dynamic Heuristics (Extended Version)</title>

Abstract: While most heuristics studied in heuristic search depend only on the state, some accumulate information during search and thus also depend on the search history. Various existing approaches use such dynamic heuristics in $\mathrm{A}^*$-like algorithms and appeal to classic results for $\mathrm{A}^*$ to show optimality. However, doing so ignores the complexities of searching with a mutable heuristic. In this paper we formalize the idea of dynamic heuristics and use them in a generic algorithm framework. We study a particular instantiation that models $\mathrm{A}^*$ with dynamic heuristics and show general optimality results. Finally we show how existing approaches from classical planning can be viewed as special cases of this instantiation, making it possible to directly apply our optimality results.

Abstract: Recently, scaling test-time compute on Large Language Models (LLM) has garnered wide attention. However, there has been limited investigation of how various reasoning prompting strategies perform as scaling. In this paper, we focus on a standard and realistic scaling setting: majority voting. We systematically conduct experiments on 6 LLMs $\times$ 8 prompting strategies $\times$ 6 benchmarks. Experiment results consistently show that as the sampling time and computational overhead increase, complicated prompting strategies with superior initial performance gradually fall behind simple Chain-of-Thought. We analyze this phenomenon and provide theoretical proofs. Additionally, we propose a probabilistic method to efficiently predict scaling performance and identify the best prompting strategy under large sampling times, eliminating the need for resource-intensive inference processes in practical applications. Furthermore, we introduce two ways derived from our theoretical analysis to significantly improve the scaling performance. We hope that our research can promote to re-examine the role of complicated prompting, unleash the potential of simple prompting strategies, and provide new insights for enhancing test-time scaling performance.

Abstract: Memes have emerged as a popular form of multimodal online communication, where their interpretation heavily depends on the specific context in which they appear. Current approaches predominantly focus on isolated meme analysis, either for harmful content detection or standalone interpretation, overlooking a fundamental challenge: the same meme can express different intents depending on its conversational context. This oversight creates an evaluation gap: although humans intuitively recognize how context shapes meme interpretation, Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) can hardly understand context-dependent meme intent. To address this critical limitation, we introduce MemeReaCon, a novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate how LVLMs understand memes in their original context. We collected memes from five different Reddit communities, keeping each meme's image, the post text, and user comments together. We carefully labeled how the text and meme work together, what the poster intended, how the meme is structured, and how the community responded. Our tests with leading LVLMs show a clear weakness: models either fail to interpret critical information in the contexts, or overly focus on visual details while overlooking communicative purpose. MemeReaCon thus serves both as a diagnostic tool exposing current limitations and as a challenging benchmark to drive development toward more sophisticated LVLMs of the context-aware understanding.

Abstract: Recent advances such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek R1 have demonstrated the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance reasoning abilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). While open-source replication efforts have primarily focused on mathematical and coding domains, methods and resources for developing general reasoning capabilities remain underexplored. This gap is partly due to the challenge of collecting diverse and verifiable reasoning data suitable for RL. We hypothesize that logical reasoning is critical for developing general reasoning capabilities, as logic forms a fundamental building block of reasoning. In this work, we present SynLogic, a data synthesis framework and dataset that generates diverse logical reasoning data at scale, encompassing 35 diverse logical reasoning tasks. The SynLogic approach enables controlled synthesis of data with adjustable difficulty and quantity. Importantly, all examples can be verified by simple rules, making them ideally suited for RL with verifiable rewards. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness of RL training on the SynLogic dataset based on 7B and 32B models. SynLogic leads to state-of-the-art logical reasoning performance among open-source datasets, surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B by 6 points on BBEH. Furthermore, mixing SynLogic data with mathematical and coding tasks improves the training efficiency of these domains and significantly enhances reasoning generalization. Notably, our mixed training model outperforms DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B across multiple benchmarks. These findings position SynLogic as a valuable resource for advancing the broader reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We open-source both the data synthesis pipeline and the SynLogic dataset at https://github.com/MiniMax-AI/SynLogic.

Abstract: Early-stage startup investment is a high-risk endeavor characterized by scarce data and uncertain outcomes. Traditional machine learning approaches often require large, labeled datasets and extensive fine-tuning, yet remain opaque and difficult for domain experts to interpret or improve. In this paper, we propose a transparent and data-efficient investment decision framework powered by memory-augmented large language models (LLMs) using in-context learning (ICL). Central to our method is a natural language policy embedded directly into the LLM prompt, enabling the model to apply explicit reasoning patterns and allowing human experts to easily interpret, audit, and iteratively refine the logic. We introduce a lightweight training process that combines few-shot learning with an in-context learning loop, enabling the LLM to update its decision policy iteratively based on structured feedback. With only minimal supervision and no gradient-based optimization, our system predicts startup success far more accurately than existing benchmarks. It is over 20x more precise than random chance, which succeeds 1.9% of the time. It is also 7.1x more precise than the typical 5.6% success rate of top-tier venture capital (VC) firms.

Abstract: RF/Analog design is essential for bridging digital technologies with real-world signals, ensuring the functionality and reliability of a wide range of electronic systems. However, analog design procedures are often intricate, time-consuming and reliant on expert intuition, and hinder the time and cost efficiency of circuit development. To overcome the limitations of the manual circuit design, we introduce MenTeR - a multiagent workflow integrated into an end-to-end analog design framework. By employing multiple specialized AI agents that collaboratively address different aspects of the design process, such as specification understanding, circuit optimization, and test bench validation, MenTeR reduces the dependency on frequent trial-and-error-style intervention. MenTeR not only accelerates the design cycle time but also facilitates a broader exploration of the design space, demonstrating robust capabilities in handling real-world analog systems. We believe that MenTeR lays the groundwork for future "RF/Analog Copilots" that can collaborate seamlessly with human designers.

Abstract: Enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs has garnered significant attention in both the mathematical and computer science communities. Recent works have made substantial progress in both Natural Language (NL) reasoning and Formal Language (FL) reasoning by leveraging the potential of pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods on base models. However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively. Notably, some problems resolved by our framework remain unsolved by the NL baseline model even under a larger number of trials.

Abstract: Data augmentation plays a critical role in improving model performance across various domains, but it becomes challenging with graph data due to their complex and irregular structure. To address this issue, we propose EPIC (Edit Path Interpolation via learnable Cost), a novel interpolation-based method for augmenting graph datasets. To interpolate between two graphs lying in an irregular domain, EPIC leverages the concept of graph edit distance, constructing an edit path that represents the transformation process between two graphs via edit operations. Moreover, our method introduces a context-sensitive cost model that accounts for the importance of specific edit operations formulated through a learning framework. This allows for a more nuanced transformation process, where the edit distance is not merely count-based but reflects meaningful graph attributes. With randomly sampled graphs from the edit path, we enrich the training set to enhance the generalization capability of classification models. Experimental evaluations across several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing augmentation techniques in many tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, have shown remarkable performance in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including challenging mathematical reasoning. However, most existing open-source models are only pre-trained on large-scale internet data and without math-related optimization. In this paper, we present WizardMath, which enhances the mathematical CoT reasoning abilities of LLMs without using external python tools, by applying our proposed Reinforcement Learning from Evol-Instruct Feedback (RLEIF) method to the domain of math. Through extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8k and MATH, we reveal the extraordinary capabilities of our model. Remarkably, WizardMath-Mistral 7B surpasses top-tier open-source LLMs by a substantial margin with higher data efficiency. Furthermore, WizardMath 70B even outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo, Claude 2, Gemini Pro and GPT-4-early-version. Additionally, our preliminary exploration highlights the pivotal role of instruction evolution and process supervision in achieving exceptional math performance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), which have shown remarkable capabilities, are revolutionizing AI development and potentially shaping our future. However, given their multimodality, the status quo cloud-based deployment faces some critical challenges: 1) long response time; 2) high bandwidth costs; and 3) the violation of data privacy. 6G mobile edge computing (MEC) systems may resolve these pressing issues. In this article, we explore the potential of deploying LLMs at the 6G edge. We start by introducing killer applications powered by multimodal LLMs, including robotics and healthcare, to highlight the need for deploying LLMs in the vicinity of end users. Then, we identify the critical challenges for LLM deployment at the edge and envision the 6G MEC architecture for LLMs. Furthermore, we delve into two design aspects, i.e., edge training and edge inference for LLMs. In both aspects, considering the inherent resource limitations at the edge, we discuss various cutting-edge techniques, including split learning/inference, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, quantization, and parameter-sharing inference, to facilitate the efficient deployment of LLMs. This article serves as a position paper for thoroughly identifying the motivation, challenges, and pathway for empowering LLMs at the 6G edge.

Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to interpretable AI inspired by Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which we call the NCoder. The NCoder is a modified autoencoder neural network whose latent layer is prescribed to be a subset of $n$-point correlation functions. Regarding images as draws from a lattice field theory, this architecture mimics the task of perturbatively constructing the effective action of the theory order by order in an expansion using Feynman diagrams. Alternatively, the NCoder may be regarded as simulating the procedure of statistical inference whereby high dimensional data is first summarized in terms of several lower dimensional summary statistics (here the $n$-point correlation functions), and subsequent out-of-sample data is generated by inferring the data generating distribution from these statistics. In this way the NCoder suggests a fascinating correspondence between perturbative renormalizability and the sufficiency of models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the NCoder by applying it to the generation of MNIST images, and find that generated images can be correctly classified using only information from the first three $n$-point functions of the image distribution.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of deep neural networks poses significant barriers to democratizing them to resource-limited edge devices. To address this challenge, split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising solution by of floading the primary training workload to a server via model partitioning while enabling parallel training among edge devices. However, although system optimization substantially influences the performance of SFL under resource-constrained systems, the problem remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we provide a convergence analysis of SFL which quantifies the impact of model splitting (MS) and client-side model aggregation (MA) on the learning performance, serving as a theoretical foundation. Then, we propose AdaptSFL, a novel resource-adaptive SFL framework, to expedite SFL under resource-constrained edge computing systems. Specifically, AdaptSFL adaptively controls client-side MA and MS to balance communication-computing latency and training convergence. Extensive simulations across various datasets validate that our proposed AdaptSFL framework takes considerably less time to achieve a target accuracy than benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.

Abstract: Despite achieving outstanding performance on various cross-modal tasks, current large vision-language models (LVLMs) still suffer from hallucination issues, manifesting as inconsistencies between their generated responses and the corresponding images. Prior research has implicated that the low quality of instruction data, particularly the skewed balance between positive and negative samples, is a significant contributor to model hallucinations. Recently, researchers have proposed high-quality instruction datasets, such as LRV-Instruction, to mitigate model hallucination. Nonetheless, our investigation reveals that hallucinatory concepts from different LVLMs exhibit specificity, i.e. the distribution of hallucinatory concepts varies significantly across models. Existing datasets did not consider the hallucination specificity of different models in the design processes, thereby diminishing their efficacy in mitigating model hallucination. In this paper, we propose a targeted instruction data generation framework named DFTG that tailored to the hallucination specificity of different models. Concretely, DFTG consists of two stages: hallucination diagnosis, which extracts the necessary information from the model's responses and images for hallucination diagnosis; and targeted data generation, which generates targeted instruction data based on diagnostic results. The experimental results on hallucination benchmarks demonstrate that the targeted instruction data generated by our method are more effective in mitigating hallucinations compared to previous datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems rely heavily on human-generated data, yet the people behind that data are often overlooked. Human behavior can play a major role in AI training datasets, be it in limiting access to existing works or in deciding which types of new works to create or whether to create any at all. We examine creators' behavioral change when their works become training data for commercial AI. Specifically, we focus on contributors on Unsplash, a popular stock image platform with about 6 million high-quality photos and illustrations. In the summer of 2020, Unsplash launched a research program and released a dataset of 25,000 images for commercial AI use. We study contributors' reactions, comparing contributors whose works were included in this dataset to contributors whose works were not. Our results suggest that treated contributors left the platform at a higher-than-usual rate and substantially slowed down the rate of new uploads. Professional photographers and more heavily affected users had a stronger reaction than amateurs and less affected users. We also show that affected users changed the variety and novelty of contributions to the platform, which can potentially lead to lower-quality AI outputs in the long run. Our findings highlight a critical trade-off: the drive to expand AI capabilities versus the incentives of those producing training data. We conclude with policy proposals, including dynamic compensation schemes and structured data markets, to realign incentives at the data frontier.

<title>Meaning-Typed Programming: Language Abstraction and Runtime for Model-Integrated Applications</title>

Abstract: Software development is shifting from traditional logical programming to model-integrated applications that leverage generative AI and large language models (LLMs) during runtime. However, integrating LLMs remains complex, requiring developers to manually craft prompts and process outputs. Existing tools attempt to assist with prompt engineering, but often introduce additional complexity.
  This paper presents Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP) model, a novel paradigm that abstracts LLM integration through intuitive language-level constructs. By leveraging the inherent semantic richness of code, MTP automates prompt generation and response handling without additional developer effort. We introduce the by operator for seamless LLM invocation, MT-IR, a meaning-based intermediate representation for semantic extraction, and MT-Runtime, an automated system for managing LLM interactions. We implement MTP in Jac, a Python superset language and find that MTP significantly reduces coding complexity while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. Our evaluation across diverse benchmarks and user studies demonstrates that MTP outperforms existing frameworks such as DSPy and LMQL by reducing lines of code by factors of 2.3-7.5X and 1.3-10.7X respectively. For math problems from the GSM8k dataset, MTP achieves accuracy rates approaching 90%, while reducing token usage in 10 out of 13 benchmarks. This leads to cost savings up to 4.5X and runtime speedups as high as 4.75X. Additionally, MTP demonstrates resilience even when 50% of naming conventions are suboptimal, establishing it as a practical, efficient solution for streamlining model-integrated application development.

<title>Quantifying Prediction Consistency Under Fine-Tuning Multiplicity in Tabular LLMs</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs on tabular classification tasks can lead to the phenomenon of fine-tuning multiplicity where equally well-performing models make conflicting predictions on the same input. Fine-tuning multiplicity can arise due to variations in the training process, e.g., seed, weight initialization, minor changes to training data, etc., raising concerns about the reliability of Tabular LLMs in high-stakes applications such as finance, hiring, education, healthcare. Our work formalizes this unique challenge of fine-tuning multiplicity in Tabular LLMs and proposes a novel measure to quantify the consistency of individual predictions without expensive model retraining. Our measure quantifies a prediction's consistency by analyzing (sampling) the model's local behavior around that input in the embedding space. Interestingly, we show that sampling in the local neighborhood can be leveraged to provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction consistency under a broad class of fine-tuned models, i.e., inputs with sufficiently high local stability (as defined by our measure) also remain consistent across several fine-tuned models with high probability. We perform experiments on multiple real-world datasets to show that our local stability measure preemptively captures consistency under actual multiplicity across several fine-tuned models, outperforming competing measures.

<title>Mixed Non-linear Quantization for Vision Transformers</title>

Abstract: The majority of quantization methods have been proposed to reduce the model size of Vision Transformers, yet most of them have overlooked the quantization of non-linear operations. Only a few works have addressed quantization for non-linear operations, but they applied a single quantization method across all non-linear operations. We believe that this can be further improved by employing a different quantization method for each non-linear operation. Therefore, to assign the most error-minimizing quantization method from the known methods to each non-linear layer, we propose a mixed non-linear quantization that considers layer-wise quantization sensitivity measured by SQNR difference metric. The results show that our method outperforms I-BERT, FQ-ViT, and I-ViT in both 8-bit and 6-bit settings for ViT, DeiT, and Swin models by an average of 0.6%p and 19.6%p, respectively. Our method outperforms I-BERT and I-ViT by 0.6%p and 20.8%p, respectively, when training time is limited. We plan to release our code at https://gitlab.com/ones-ai/mixed-non-linear-quantization.

<title>Your Turn: At Home Turning Angle Estimation for Parkinson's Disease Severity Assessment</title>

Abstract: People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.

Abstract: Higher-order gravitational wave modes from quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary black hole mergers encode key information about these systems' nonlinear dynamics. We model these waveforms using transformer architectures, targeting the evolution from late inspiral through ringdown. Our data is derived from the \texttt{NRHybSur3dq8} surrogate model, which includes spherical harmonic modes up to $\ell \leq 4$ (excluding $(4,0)$, $(4,\pm1)$ and including $(5,5)$ modes). These waveforms span mass ratios $q \leq 8$, spin components $s^z_{{1,2}} \in [-0.8, 0.8]$, and inclination angles $\theta \in [0, \pi]$. The model processes input data over the time interval $t \in [-5000\textrm{M}, -100\textrm{M})$ and generates predictions for the plus and cross polarizations, $(h_{+}, h_{\times})$, over the interval $t \in [-100\textrm{M}, 130\textrm{M}]$. Utilizing 16 NVIDIA A100 GPUs on the Delta supercomputer, we trained the transformer model in 15 hours on over 14 million samples. The model's performance was evaluated on a test dataset of 840,000 samples, achieving mean and median overlap scores of 0.996 and 0.997, respectively, relative to the surrogate-based ground truth signals. We further benchmark the model on numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog, finding that it generalizes well to out-of-distribution systems, capable of reproducing the dynamics of systems with mass ratios up to $q=15$ and spin magnitudes up to 0.998, with a median overlap of 0.969 across 521 NR waveforms and up to 0.998 in face-on/off configurations. These results demonstrate that transformer-based models can capture the nonlinear dynamics of binary black hole mergers with high accuracy, even outside the surrogate training domain, enabling fast sequence modeling of higher-order wave modes.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences is a crucial step in building helpful and safe AI tools, which usually involve training on supervised datasets. Popular algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on pairs of AI-generated responses ranked according to human annotation. The response pair annotation process might bring human bias. Building a correct preference dataset is the costly part of the alignment pipeline. To improve annotation efficiency and quality in the LLMs alignment, we propose REAL: Response Embedding-based Alignment for LLMs, a strategy for constructing a high-quality training dataset that focuses on acquiring the less ambiguous preference pairs for labeling out of a set of response candidates. Our selection process is based on the similarity of embedding responses independently of prompts, which guarantees the selection process in an off-policy setting, avoiding adaptively measuring the similarity during the training. Experimental results on real-world dataset SHP2 and synthetic HH-RLHF benchmarks indicate that choosing dissimilar response pairs enhances the direct alignment of LLMs while reducing inherited labeling errors. The model aligned with dissimilar response pairs obtained a better margin and win rate on the dialogue task. Our findings suggest that focusing on distinct pairs can reduce the label error and improve LLM alignment efficiency, saving up to $65\%$ of annotators' work.

<title>Geometric Signatures of Compositionality Across a Language Model's Lifetime</title>

Abstract: By virtue of linguistic compositionality, few syntactic rules and a finite lexicon can generate an unbounded number of sentences. That is, language, though seemingly high-dimensional, can be explained using relatively few degrees of freedom. An open question is whether contemporary language models (LMs) reflect the intrinsic simplicity of language that is enabled by compositionality. We take a geometric view of this problem by relating the degree of compositionality in a dataset to the intrinsic dimension (ID) of its representations under an LM, a measure of feature complexity. We find not only that the degree of dataset compositionality is reflected in representations' ID, but that the relationship between compositionality and geometric complexity arises due to learned linguistic features over training. Finally, our analyses reveal a striking contrast between nonlinear and linear dimensionality, showing they respectively encode semantic and superficial aspects of linguistic composition.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require alignment to effectively and safely follow user instructions. This process necessitates training an aligned version for every base model, resulting in significant computational overhead. In this work, we propose NUDGING, a simple, training-free algorithm that aligns any base model at inference time using a small aligned model. NUDGING is motivated by recent findings that alignment primarily alters the model's behavior on a small subset of stylistic tokens (e.g., discourse markers). We find that base models are significantly more uncertain when generating these tokens. Building on this insight, NUDGING employs a small aligned model to generate nudging tokens to guide the base model's output during decoding when the base model's uncertainty is high, with only a minor additional inference overhead. We evaluate NUDGING across 3 model families on a diverse range of open-instruction tasks. Without any training, nudging a large base model with a 7x-14x smaller aligned model achieves zero-shot performance comparable to, and sometimes surpassing, that of large aligned models. By operating at the token level, NUDGING enables off-the-shelf collaboration between model families. For instance, nudging Gemma-2-27b with Llama-27b-chat outperforms Llama-2-70b-chat on various tasks. Overall, our work offers a modular and cost-efficient solution to LLM alignment. Our code and demo are available at: https://fywalter.github.io/nudging/ .

<title>Expand and Compress: Exploring Tuning Principles for Continual Spatio-Temporal Graph Forecasting</title>

Abstract: The widespread deployment of sensing devices leads to a surge in data for spatio-temporal forecasting applications such as traffic flow, air quality, and wind energy. Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.

Abstract: We conduct a scoping review of existing approaches for synthetic EHR data generation, and benchmark major methods with proposed open-source software to offer recommendations for practitioners. We search three academic databases for our scoping review. Methods are benchmarked on open-source EHR datasets, MIMIC-III/IV. Seven existing methods covering major categories and two baseline methods are implemented and compared. Evaluation metrics concern data fidelity, downstream utility, privacy protection, and computational cost. 42 studies are identified and classified into five categories. Seven open-source methods covering all categories are selected, trained on MIMIC-III, and evaluated on MIMIC-III or MIMIC-IV for transportability considerations. Among them, GAN-based methods demonstrate competitive performance in fidelity and utility on MIMIC-III; rule-based methods excel in privacy protection. Similar findings are observed on MIMIC-IV, except that GAN-based methods further outperform the baseline methods in preserving fidelity. A Python package, "SynthEHRella", is provided to integrate various choices of approaches and evaluation metrics, enabling more streamlined exploration and evaluation of multiple methods. We found that method choice is governed by the relative importance of the evaluation metrics in downstream use cases. We provide a decision tree to guide the choice among the benchmarked methods. Based on the decision tree, GAN-based methods excel when distributional shifts exist between the training and testing populations. Otherwise, CorGAN and MedGAN are most suitable for association modeling and predictive modeling, respectively. Future research should prioritize enhancing fidelity of the synthetic data while controlling privacy exposure, and comprehensive benchmarking of longitudinal or conditional generation methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have majorly advanced NLP and AI, and next to their ability to perform a wide range of procedural tasks, a major success factor is their internalized factual knowledge. Since Petroni et al. (2019), analyzing this knowledge has gained attention. However, most approaches investigate one question at a time via modest-sized pre-defined samples, introducing an ``availability bias'' (Tversky&amp;Kahnemann, 1973) that prevents the analysis of knowledge (or beliefs) of LLMs beyond the experimenter's predisposition.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel methodology to comprehensively materialize an LLM's factual knowledge through recursive querying and result consolidation. Our approach is a milestone for LLM research, for the first time providing constructive insights into the scope and structure of LLM knowledge (or beliefs).
  As a prototype, we build GPTKB, a knowledge base (KB) comprising 101 million relational triples for over 2.9 million entities from GPT-4o-mini. We use GPTKB to exemplarily analyze GPT-4o-mini's factual knowledge in terms of scale, accuracy, bias, cutoff and consistency, at the same time. GPTKB is accessible at https://gptkb.org

Abstract: Radiology reports are often lengthy and unstructured, posing challenges for referring physicians to quickly identify critical imaging findings while increasing the risk of missed information. This retrospective study aimed to enhance radiology reports by making them concise and well-structured, with findings organized by relevant organs. To achieve this, we utilized private large language models (LLMs) deployed locally within our institution's firewall, ensuring data security and minimizing computational costs. Using a dataset of 814 radiology reports from seven board-certified body radiologists at Moffitt Cancer Center, we tested five prompting strategies within the LangChain framework. After evaluating several models, the Mixtral LLM demonstrated superior adherence to formatting requirements compared to alternatives like Llama. The optimal strategy involved condensing reports first and then applying structured formatting based on specific instructions, reducing verbosity while improving clarity. Across all radiologists and reports, the Mixtral LLM reduced redundant word counts by more than 53%. These findings highlight the potential of locally deployed, open-source LLMs to streamline radiology reporting. By generating concise, well-structured reports, these models enhance information retrieval and better meet the needs of referring physicians, ultimately improving clinical workflows.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis claims that recent foundation models are converging to a shared representation space as a function of their downstream task performance, irrespective of the objectives and data modalities used to train these models (Huh et al., 2024). Representational similarity is generally measured for individual datasets and is not necessarily consistent across datasets. Thus, one may wonder whether this convergence of model representations is confounded by the datasets commonly used in machine learning. Here, we propose a systematic way to measure how representational similarity between models varies with the set of stimuli used to construct the representations. We find that the objective function is a crucial factor in determining the consistency of representational similarities across datasets. Specifically, self-supervised vision models learn representations whose relative pairwise similarities generalize better from one dataset to another compared to those of image classification or image-text models. Moreover, the correspondence between representational similarities and the models' task behavior is dataset-dependent, being most strongly pronounced for single-domain datasets. Our work provides a framework for analyzing similarities of model representations across datasets and linking those similarities to differences in task behavior.

Abstract: Effective group decision-making is critical in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Yet, how different mechanisms for reaching consensus impact collaboration quality and efficiency remains understudied. We conduct a systematic study on group decision-making mechanisms in a decentralized setting. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how different voting rules affect decision quality and efficiency in a multi-round collaboration. Results reveal that majority voting often cause inefficient collaboration due to its strict acceptance criteria. At the extreme, unanimous voting gives 87% lower initial performance than the best-performing method. Our qualitative analysis of cross-agent communication shows that messages become longer and more repetitive over time: while message length increases by 84%, similarity to the previous round increases to 90%. Based on these insights, language-based early stopping methods make the performance 13% closer to oracle while reducing rounds by 50%. Our findings highlight the crucial role of group decision-making in optimizing MAS collaboration.

Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) has emerged as a pivotal task in natural language processing (NLP), aimed at automatically detecting causal relationships between events in text. In this comprehensive survey, we systematically elucidate the foundational principles and technical frameworks of ECI, proposing a novel classification framework to categorize and clarify existing methods. {We discuss associated challenges, provide quantitative evaluations, and outline future directions for this dynamic and rapidly evolving field. We first delineate key definitions, problem formalization, and evaluation protocols of ECI. Our classification framework organizes ECI methods based on two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review methods including feature pattern-based matching, machine learning-based classification, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside common data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on techniques such as deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. We dedicate specific discussions to advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, we analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges of each method. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to assess various ECI methods. Finally, we explore future research directions.

This paper addresses the research question: \emph{Can LLMs generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks?}
  To answer this, we propose a pipeline using reinforcement learning with simulated feedback, where the network's response to LLM-generated content (i.e., the reward) is simulated through a formal engagement model. This approach bypasses the temporal cost and complexity of live experiments, enabling an efficient feedback loop between the LLM and the network under study. It also allows to control over endogenous factors such as the LLM's position within the social network and the distribution of opinions on a given topic. Our approach is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. Such flexibility makes it suitable for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.
  Using our framework, we analyze the performance of LLMs in generating social engagement under different conditions, showcasing their full potential in this task. The experimental code is publicly available at https://github.com/mminici/Engagement-Driven-Content-Generation.

Abstract: We introduce CatNet, an algorithm that effectively controls False Discovery Rate (FDR) and selects significant features in LSTM. CatNet employs the derivative of SHAP values to quantify the feature importance, and constructs a vector-formed mirror statistic for FDR control with the Gaussian Mirror algorithm. To avoid instability due to nonlinear or temporal correlations among features, we also propose a new kernel-based independence measure. CatNet performs robustly on different model settings with both simulated and real-world data, which reduces overfitting and improves interpretability of the model. Our framework that introduces SHAP for feature importance in FDR control algorithms and improves Gaussian Mirror can be naturally extended to other time-series or sequential deep learning models.

Abstract: Modern recommendation systems frequently employ online learning to dynamically update their models with freshly collected data. The most commonly used optimizer for updating neural networks in these contexts is the Adam optimizer, which integrates momentum ($m_t$) and adaptive learning rate ($v_t$). However, the volatile nature of online learning data, characterized by its frequent distribution shifts and presence of noise, poses significant challenges to Adam's standard optimization process: (1) Adam may use outdated momentum and the average of squared gradients, resulting in slower adaptation to distribution changes, and (2) Adam's performance is adversely affected by data noise. To mitigate these issues, we introduce CAdam, a confidence-based optimization strategy that assesses the consistency between the momentum and the gradient for each parameter dimension before deciding on updates. If momentum and gradient are in sync, CAdam proceeds with parameter updates according to Adam's original formulation; if not, it temporarily withholds updates and monitors potential shifts in data distribution in subsequent iterations. This method allows CAdam to distinguish between the true distributional shifts and mere noise, and to adapt more quickly to new data distributions. In various settings with distribution shift or noise, our experiments demonstrate that CAdam surpasses other well-known optimizers, including the original Adam. Furthermore, in large-scale A/B testing within a live recommendation system, CAdam significantly enhances model performance compared to Adam, leading to substantial increases in the system's gross merchandise volume (GMV).

Abstract: Nodes in the real-world graphs exhibit diverse patterns in numerous aspects, such as degree and homophily. However, most existent node predictors fail to capture a wide range of node patterns or to make predictions based on distinct node patterns, resulting in unsatisfactory classification performance. In this paper, we reveal that different node predictors are good at handling nodes with specific patterns and only apply one node predictor uniformly could lead to suboptimal result. To mitigate this gap, we propose a mixture of experts framework, MoE-NP, for node classification. Specifically, MoE-NP combines a mixture of node predictors and strategically selects models based on node patterns. Experimental results from a range of real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements from MoE-NP.

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of synthesized images remains a significant challenge in the development of text-to-image (T2I) generation. Most existing studies in this area primarily focus on evaluating text-image alignment, image quality, and object composition capabilities, with comparatively fewer studies addressing the evaluation of the factuality of T2I models, particularly when the concepts involved are knowledge-intensive. To mitigate this gap, we present T2I-FactualBench in this work - the largest benchmark to date in terms of the number of concepts and prompts specifically designed to evaluate the factuality of knowledge-intensive concept generation. T2I-FactualBench consists of a three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation framework, ranging from the basic memorization of individual knowledge concepts to the more complex composition of multiple knowledge concepts. We further introduce a multi-round visual question answering (VQA) based evaluation framework to assess the factuality of three-tiered knowledge-intensive text-to-image generation tasks. Experiments on T2I-FactualBench indicate that current state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models still leave significant room for improvement.

Abstract: The advancement of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has propelled their application in the medical field. However, Medical LVLMs (Med-LVLMs) encounter factuality challenges due to modality misalignment, where the models prioritize textual knowledge over visual input, leading to hallucinations that contradict information in medical images. Previous attempts to enhance modality alignment in Med-LVLMs through preference optimization have inadequately mitigated clinical relevance in preference data, making these samples easily distinguishable and reducing alignment effectiveness. To address this challenge, we propose MMedPO, a novel multimodal medical preference optimization approach that considers the clinical relevance of preference samples to enhance Med-LVLM alignment. MMedPO curates multimodal preference data by introducing two types of dispreference: (1) plausible hallucinations injected through target Med-LVLMs or GPT-4o to produce medically inaccurate responses, and (2) lesion region neglect achieved through local lesion-noising, disrupting visual understanding of critical areas. We then calculate clinical relevance for each sample based on scores from multiple Med-LLMs and visual tools, and integrate these scores into the preference optimization process as weights, enabling effective alignment. Our experiments demonstrate that MMedPO significantly enhances factual accuracy in Med-LVLMs, achieving substantial improvements over existing preference optimization methods by averaging 14.2% and 51.7% across the Med-VQA and report generation tasks. Our code are available in https://github.com/aiming-lab/MMedPO.

Abstract: Conventional biomedical research is increasingly labor-intensive due to the exponential growth of scientific literature and datasets. Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), has the potential to revolutionize this process by automating various steps. Still, significant challenges remain, including the need for multidisciplinary expertise, logicality of experimental design, and performance measurements. This paper introduces BioResearcher, the first end-to-end automated system designed to streamline the entire biomedical research process involving dry lab experiments. BioResearcher employs a modular multi-agent architecture, integrating specialized agents for search, literature processing, experimental design, and programming. By decomposing complex tasks into logically related sub-tasks and utilizing a hierarchical learning approach, BioResearcher effectively addresses the challenges of multidisciplinary requirements and logical complexity. Furthermore, BioResearcher incorporates an LLM-based reviewer for in-process quality control and introduces novel evaluation metrics to assess the quality and automation of experimental protocols. BioResearcher successfully achieves an average execution success rate of 63.07% across eight previously unmet research objectives. The generated protocols averagely outperform typical agent systems by 22.0% on five quality metrics. The system demonstrates significant potential to reduce researchers' workloads and accelerate biomedical discoveries, paving the way for future innovations in automated research systems.

<title>RAC3: Retrieval-Augmented Corner Case Comprehension for Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Understanding and addressing corner cases is essential for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Vision-language models (VLMs) play a crucial role in enhancing scenario comprehension, yet they face significant challenges, such as hallucination and insufficient real-world grounding, which compromise their performance in critical driving scenarios. In this work, RAC3, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of VLMs in corner case comprehension, is proposed. RAC3 integrates a frequency-spatial fusion (FSF) image encoder, a cross-modal alignment training method for embedding models with hard and semi-hard negative mining, and a fast querying and retrieval pipeline based on K-Means clustering and hierarchical navigable small world (HNSW) indexing. A multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting strategy to guide analogical reasoning and reduce hallucinations during inference is introduced. Moreover, an update mechanism is integrated into RAC3 to ensure continual learning within the framework. Extensive experiments on the CODA and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that RAC3 significantly improves corner case comprehension across multiple downstream tasks. Compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, RAC3 achieves the highest final score of 74.46 on the CODA-LM benchmark and shows consistent performance gains when integrated with end-to-end frameworks like DriveLM. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented strategies and cross-modal alignment for safer and more interpretable autonomous driving.

<title>HashAttention: Semantic Sparsity for Faster Inference</title>

Abstract: Leveraging long contexts is crucial for advanced AI systems, but attention computation poses a scalability challenge. While scaled dot-product attention (SDPA) exhibits token sparsity, i.e. only a few pivotal tokens significantly contribute to output, exploiting this sparsity remains challenging. Existing methods either suffer from quality degradation or require substantial additional resources. We show that identifying pivotal tokens is a Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. However, existing MIPS solutions are not well-suited for SDPA, as they are not GPU-friendly and often underperform due to the separated query and key distributions. This paper introduces HashAttention, framing pivotal token identification as a recommendation problem. Given a query, HashAttention encodes keys and queries in Hamming space, capturing the required semantic similarity, using learned mapping functions. HashAttention efficiently identifies pivotal tokens for a given query using bitwise operations and computes attention using only these tokens, improving the overall attention efficiency. Trained on generic data, HashAttention reduces tokens used by up to $16\times$ with minimal quality loss, requiring only 32 bits of auxiliary memory per token. Sparsity can be further improved to $32\times$ through task-specific fine-tuning. On A100 GPU, at $32\times$ sparsity, incorporating HashAttention reduces attention latency by up to $4.3\times$ in GPT-FAST and $2.54\times$ in FlashDecode, and achieves up to $3.12\times$ higher throughput for GPT-FAST.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that knowledge distillation can be subverted to manipulate language model benchmark scores, revealing a critical vulnerability in current evaluation practices. We introduce "Data Laundering," a process that enables the covert transfer of benchmark-specific knowledge through seemingly legitimate intermediate training steps. Through extensive experiments with a 2-layer BERT student model, we show how this approach can achieve substantial improvements in benchmark accuracy (up to 75\% on GPQA) without developing genuine reasoning capabilities. Notably, this method can be exploited intentionally or even unintentionally, as researchers may inadvertently adopt this method and inflate scores without realising the implications. While our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, we present them as a cautionary tale highlighting the urgent need for more robust evaluation methods in AI. This work aims to contribute to the ongoing discussion about evaluation integrity in AI development and the need for benchmarks that more accurately reflect true model capabilities.

<title>Verbosity-Aware Rationale Reduction: Effective Reduction of Redundant Rationale via Principled Criteria</title>

arXiv:2412.21006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on generating extensive intermediate reasoning units (e.g., tokens, sentences) to enhance final answer quality across a wide range of complex tasks. While this approach has proven effective, it inevitably increases substantial inference costs. Previous methods adopting token-level reduction without clear criteria result in poor performance compared to models trained with complete rationale. To address this challenge, we propose a novel sentence-level rationale reduction framework leveraging likelihood-based criteria, verbosity, to identify and remove redundant reasoning sentences. Unlike previous approaches, our method leverages verbosity to selectively remove redundant reasoning sentences while preserving reasoning capabilities. Our experimental results across various reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method improves performance by an average of 7.71% while reducing token generation by 19.87% compared to model trained with complete reasoning paths.

Abstract: When can we say that two neural systems are the same? The answer to this question is goal-dependent, and it is often addressed through correlative methods such as Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) and Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). What nuances do we miss, however, when we fail to causally probe the representations? Do the dangers of cause vs. correlation exist in comparative representational analyses? In this work, we introduce a method for connecting neural representational similarity to behavior through causal interventions. The method learns orthogonal transformations that find an aligned subspace in which behavioral information from multiple distributed networks' representations can be isolated and interchanged. We first show that the method can be used to transfer the behavior from one frozen Neural Network (NN) to another in a manner similar to model stitching, and we show how the method can complement correlative similarity measures like RSA. We then introduce an efficient subspace orthogonalization technique using the Gram-Schmidt process -- that can also be used for Distributed Alignment Search (DAS) -- allowing us to perform analyses on larger models. Next, we empirically and theoretically show how our method can be equivalent to model stitching when desired, or it can take a form that is more restrictive to causal information, and in both cases, it reduces the number of required matrices for a comparison of n models from quadratic to linear in n. We then show how we can augment the loss objective with an auxiliary loss to train causally relevant alignments even when we can only read the representations from one of the two networks during training (like with biological networks). Lastly, we use number representations as a case study to explore how our method can be used to compare specific types of representational information across tasks and models.

<title>Neural Honeytrace: A Robust Plug-and-Play Watermarking Framework against Model Extraction Attacks</title>

Abstract: Developing high-performance deep learning models is resource-intensive, leading model owners to utilize Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platforms instead of publicly releasing their models. However, malicious users may exploit query interfaces to execute model extraction attacks, reconstructing the target model's functionality locally. While prior research has investigated triggerable watermarking techniques for asserting ownership, existing methods face significant challenges: (1) most approaches require additional training, resulting in high overhead and limited flexibility, and (2) they often fail to account for advanced attackers, leaving them vulnerable to adaptive attacks.
  In this paper, we propose Neural Honeytrace, a robust plug-and-play watermarking framework against model extraction attacks. We first formulate a watermark transmission model from an information-theoretic perspective, providing an interpretable account of the principles and limitations of existing triggerable watermarking. Guided by the model, we further introduce: (1) a similarity-based training-free watermarking method for plug-and-play and flexible watermarking, and (2) a distribution-based multi-step watermark information transmission strategy for robust watermarking. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that Neural Honeytrace outperforms previous methods in efficiency and resisting adaptive attacks. Neural Honeytrace reduces the average number of samples required for a worst-case t-Test-based copyright claim from 193,252 to 1,857 with zero training cost.

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems ($N>12$, where $N$ is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems $N\geq12$ compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work advances a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for quantum gravity studies and out-of-time-ordered thermal correlators computation in quantum many-body systems on near-term quantum hardware.

<title>Visual Attention Never Fades: Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration for Detailed Image Captioning in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2502.01419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detailed image captioning is essential for tasks like data generation and aiding visually impaired individuals. High-quality captions require a balance between precision and recall, which remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we hypothesize that this limitation stems from weakening and increasingly noisy visual attention as responses lengthen. To address this issue, we propose SPARC (Selective Progressive Attention ReCalibration), a training-free method that enhances the contribution of visual tokens during decoding. SPARC is founded on three key observations: (1) increasing the influence of all visual tokens reduces recall; thus, SPARC selectively amplifies visual tokens; (2) as captions lengthen, visual attention becomes noisier, so SPARC identifies critical visual tokens by leveraging attention differences across time steps; (3) as visual attention gradually weakens, SPARC reinforces it to preserve its influence. Our experiments, incorporating both automated and human evaluations, demonstrate that existing methods improve the precision of MLLMs at the cost of recall. In contrast, our proposed method enhances both precision and recall with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating synthetic users for evaluating interactive agents designed to encourage positive behavior changes, such as in health and lifestyle coaching. The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model. Using two independently-developed agents for sleep and diabetes coaching as case studies, the validity of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing the coaching agent's understanding of the synthetic users' needs and challenges. Finally, through multiple blinded evaluations of user-coach interactions by human experts, we demonstrate that our synthetic users with health and behavioral attributes more accurately portray real human users with the same attributes, compared to generic synthetic users not grounded in such attributes. The proposed framework lays the foundation for efficient development of conversational agents through extensive, realistic, and grounded simulated interactions.

<title>Why Safeguarded Ships Run Aground? Aligned Large Language Models' Safety Mechanisms Tend to Be Anchored in The Template Region</title>

Abstract: The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs' safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from the template region, which largely influences these models' safety behavior. We refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses demonstrate how it leads to models' susceptibility when encountering inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.

Abstract: As text generation systems' outputs are increasingly anthropomorphic -- perceived as human-like -- scholars have also increasingly raised concerns about how such outputs can lead to harmful outcomes, such as users over-relying or developing emotional dependence on these systems. How to intervene on such system outputs to mitigate anthropomorphic behaviors and their attendant harmful outcomes, however, remains understudied. With this work, we aim to provide empirical and theoretical grounding for developing such interventions. To do so, we compile an inventory of interventions grounded both in prior literature and a crowdsourcing study where participants edited system outputs to make them less human-like. Drawing on this inventory, we also develop a conceptual framework to help characterize the landscape of possible interventions, articulate distinctions between different types of interventions, and provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions.

Abstract: Multilingual audio-text retrieval (ML-ATR) is a challenging task that aims to retrieve audio clips or multilingual texts from databases. However, existing ML-ATR schemes suffer from inconsistencies for instance similarity matching across languages. We theoretically analyze the inconsistency in terms of both multilingual modal alignment direction error and weight error, and propose the theoretical weight error upper bound for quantifying the inconsistency. Based on the analysis of the weight error upper bound, we find that the inconsistency problem stems from the data distribution error caused by random sampling of languages. We propose a consistent ML-ATR scheme using 1-to-k contrastive learning and audio-English co-anchor contrastive learning, aiming to mitigate the negative impact of data distribution error on recall and consistency in ML-ATR. Experimental results on the translated AudioCaps and Clotho datasets show that our scheme achieves state-of-the-art performance on recall and consistency metrics for eight mainstream languages, including English. Our code will be available at https://github.com/ATRI-ACL/ATRI-ACL.

Abstract: We conduct an incentivized laboratory experiment to study people's perception of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) alignment in the context of economic decision-making. Using a panel of economic problems spanning the domains of risk, time preference, social preference, and strategic interactions, we ask human subjects to make choices for themselves and to predict the choices made by GenAI on behalf of a human user. We find that people overestimate the degree of alignment between GenAI's choices and human choices. In every problem, human subjects' average prediction about GenAI's choice is substantially closer to the average human-subject choice than it is to the GenAI choice. At the individual level, different subjects' predictions about GenAI's choice in a given problem are highly correlated with their own choices in the same problem. We explore the implications of people overestimating GenAI alignment in a simple theoretical model.

<title>FragFM: Hierarchical Framework for Efficient Molecule Generation via Fragment-Level Discrete Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: We introduce FragFM, a novel hierarchical framework via fragment-level discrete flow matching for efficient molecular graph generation. FragFM generates molecules at the fragment level, leveraging a coarse-to-fine autoencoder to reconstruct details at the atom level. Together with a stochastic fragment bag strategy to effectively handle an extensive fragment space, our framework enables more efficient and scalable molecular generation. We demonstrate that our fragment-based approach achieves better property control than the atom-based method and additional flexibility through conditioning the fragment bag. We also propose a Natural Product Generation benchmark (NPGen) to evaluate modern molecular graph generative models' ability to generate natural product-like molecules. Since natural products are biologically prevalidated and differ from typical drug-like molecules, our benchmark provides a more challenging yet meaningful evaluation relevant to drug discovery. We conduct a FragFM comparative study against various models on diverse molecular generation benchmarks, including NPGen, demonstrating superior performance. The results highlight the potential of fragment-based generative modeling for large-scale, property-aware molecular design, paving the way for more efficient exploration of chemical space.

<title>D2S-FLOW: Automated Parameter Extraction from Datasheets for SPICE Model Generation Using Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2502.16540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In electronic design, engineers often manually search through extensive documents to retrieve component parameters required for constructing SPICE models, a process that is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present an automated framework called D2S-FLOW that leverages large language models (LLMs) to extract electrical parameters from datasheets and generate SPICE models with high precision and efficiency, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention. Unlike traditional RAG systems, D2S-FLOW employs a workflow to enhance precision in handling unstructured documents and inconsistent naming conventions through three innovative mechanisms: Attention-Guided Document Focusing (AGDF), Hierarchical Document-Enhanced Retrieval (HDER), and Heterogeneous Named Entity Normalization (HNEN). AGDF narrows retrieval to user-selected documents, HDER utilizes document structure for precise parameter localization, and HNEN standardizes terminology via semantic inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework achieves an Exact Match (EM) of 0.86, an F1 score of 0.92, and an Exact Correctness (EC) of 0.96, outperforming the strongest baseline by 19.4%, 5.7%, and 13.1%, respectively. Additionally, it reduces API token consumption by 38% and minimizes the irrelevant information ratio to 4%, showcasing substantial improvements in resource efficiency. This research provides an effective automated solution for circuit design.

Abstract: Compound AI systems, comprising multiple interacting components such as LLMs, foundation models, and external tools, have demonstrated remarkable improvements compared to single models in various tasks. To ensure their effective deployment in real-world applications, aligning these systems with human preferences is crucial. However, aligning the compound system via policy optimization, unlike the alignment of a single model, is challenging for two main reasons: (i) non-differentiable interactions between components make end-to-end gradient-based optimization method inapplicable, and (ii) system-level preferences cannot be directly transformed into component-level preferences. To address these challenges, we first formulate compound AI systems as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), explicitly modeling both component interactions and the associated data flows. Building on this formulation, we introduce $\textbf{SysDPO}$, a framework that extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enable joint system-level alignment. We propose two variants, SysDPO-Direct and SysDPO-Sampling, tailored for scenarios depending on whether we construct a system-specific preference dataset. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across two applications: the joint alignment of a language model and a diffusion model, and the joint alignment of an LLM collaboration system.

<title>The Built-In Robustness of Decentralized Federated Averaging to Bad Data</title>

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables devices to collaboratively train models over complex network topologies without relying on a central controller. In this setting, local data remains private, but its quality and quantity can vary significantly across nodes. The extent to which a fully decentralized system is vulnerable to poor-quality or corrupted data remains unclear, but several factors could contribute to potential risks. Without a central authority, there can be no unified mechanism to detect or correct errors, and each node operates with a localized view of the data distribution, making it difficult for the node to assess whether its perspective aligns with the true distribution. Moreover, models trained on low-quality data can propagate through the network, amplifying errors. To explore the impact of low-quality data on DFL, we simulate two scenarios with degraded data quality -- one where the corrupted data is evenly distributed in a subset of nodes and one where it is concentrated on a single node -- using a decentralized implementation of FedAvg. Our results reveal that averaging-based decentralized learning is remarkably robust to localized bad data, even when the corrupted data resides in the most influential nodes of the network. Counterintuitively, this robustness is further enhanced when the corrupted data is concentrated on a single node, regardless of its centrality in the communication network topology. This phenomenon is explained by the averaging process, which ensures that no single node -- however central -- can disproportionately influence the overall learning process.

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks. However, their quadratic computational complexity concerning sequence length remains a significant bottleneck for processing long documents. As a result, many efforts like sparse attention and state space models have been proposed to improve the efficiency of LLMs over long sequences. Though effective, these approaches compromise the performance or introduce structural complexity. This calls for a simple yet efficient model that preserves the fundamental Transformer architecture. To this end, we introduce SWAT, which enables efficient long-context handling via Sliding Window Attention Training. This paper first attributes the inefficiency of Transformers to the attention sink phenomenon resulting from the high variance of softmax operation. Then, we replace softmax with the sigmoid function and utilize a balanced ALiBi and Rotary Position Embedding for efficient information compression and retention. Experiments demonstrate that SWAT achieves SOTA performance compared with state-of-the-art linear recurrent architectures on eight benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Fzkuji/swat-attention.

<title>Anomaly Detection in Complex Dynamical Systems: A Systematic Framework Using Embedding Theory and Physics-Inspired Consistency</title>

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex dynamical systems is essential for ensuring reliability, safety, and efficiency in industrial and cyber-physical infrastructures. Predictive maintenance helps prevent costly failures, while cybersecurity monitoring has become critical as digitized systems face growing threats. Many of these systems exhibit oscillatory behaviors and bounded motion, requiring anomaly detection methods that capture structured temporal dependencies while adhering to physical consistency principles. In this work, we propose a system-theoretic approach to anomaly detection, grounded in classical embedding theory and physics-inspired consistency principles. We build upon the Fractal Whitney Embedding Prevalence Theorem that extends traditional embedding techniques to complex system dynamics. Additionally, we introduce state-derivative pairs as an embedding strategy to capture system evolution. To enforce temporal coherence, we develop a Temporal Differential Consistency Autoencoder (TDC-AE), incorporating a TDC-Loss that aligns the approximated derivatives of latent variables with their dynamic representations. We evaluate our method on the C-MAPSS dataset, a benchmark for turbofan aeroengine degradation. TDC-AE outperforms LSTMs and Transformers while achieving a nearly 200x reduction in MAC operations, making it particularly suited for lightweight edge computing. Our findings support the hypothesis that anomalies disrupt stable system dynamics, providing a robust signal for anomaly detection.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a significant challenge, often leading to suboptimal or misaligned behaviors in complex, coordinated environments. We introduce Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning from Multi-phase Human Feedback of Mixed Quality ($\text{M}^3\text{HF}$), a novel framework that integrates multi-phase human feedback of mixed quality into the MARL training process. By involving humans with diverse expertise levels to provide iterative guidance, $\text{M}^3\text{HF}$ leverages both expert and non-expert feedback to continuously refine agents' policies. During training, we strategically pause agent learning for human evaluation, parse feedback using large language models to assign it appropriately and update reward functions through predefined templates and adaptive weights by using weight decay and performance-based adjustments. Our approach enables the integration of nuanced human insights across various levels of quality, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of multi-agent cooperation. Empirical results in challenging environments demonstrate that $\text{M}^3\text{HF}$ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively addressing the complexities of reward design in MARL and enabling broader human participation in the training process.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.

<title>The Role of Visual Modality in Multimodal Mathematical Reasoning: Challenges and Insights</title>

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on multimodal mathematical reasoning, particularly emphasizing the creation of relevant datasets and benchmarks. Despite this, the role of visual information in reasoning has been underexplored. Our findings show that existing multimodal mathematical models minimally leverage visual information, and model performance remains largely unaffected by changes to or removal of images in the dataset. We attribute this to the dominance of textual information and answer options that inadvertently guide the model to correct answers. To improve evaluation methods, we introduce the HC-M3D dataset, specifically designed to require image reliance for problem-solving and to challenge models with similar, yet distinct, images that change the correct answer. In testing leading models, their failure to detect these subtle visual differences suggests limitations in current visual perception capabilities. Additionally, we observe that the common approach of improving general VQA capabilities by combining various types of image encoders does not contribute to math reasoning performance. This finding also presents a challenge to enhancing visual reliance during math reasoning. Our benchmark and code would be available at \href{https://github.com/Yufang-Liu/visual_modality_role}{https://github.com/Yufang-Liu/visual\_modality\_role}.

Abstract: We propose DRAGO, a novel approach for continual model-based reinforcement learning aimed at improving the incremental development of world models across a sequence of tasks that differ in their reward functions but not the state space or dynamics. DRAGO comprises two key components: Synthetic Experience Rehearsal, which leverages generative models to create synthetic experiences from past tasks, allowing the agent to reinforce previously learned dynamics without storing data, and Regaining Memories Through Exploration, which introduces an intrinsic reward mechanism to guide the agent toward revisiting relevant states from prior tasks. Together, these components enable the agent to maintain a comprehensive and continually developing world model, facilitating more effective learning and adaptation across diverse environments. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that DRAGO is able to preserve knowledge across tasks, achieving superior performance in various continual learning scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly struggle with specialized or emerging topics which are rarely seen in the training corpus. Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) addresses this by structuring domain knowledge as a graph for dynamic retrieval. However, existing pipelines involve complex engineering workflows, making it difficult to isolate the impact of individual components. It is also challenging to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness due to the overlap between the pretraining and evaluation datasets. In this work, we introduce ROGRAG, a Robustly Optimized GraphRAG framework. Specifically, we propose a multi-stage retrieval mechanism that integrates dual-level with logic form retrieval methods to improve retrieval robustness without increasing computational cost. To further refine the system, we incorporate various result verification methods and adopt an incremental database construction approach. Through extensive ablation experiments, we rigorously assess the effectiveness of each component. Our implementation includes comparative experiments on SeedBench, where Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct initially underperformed. ROGRAG significantly improves the score from 60.0% to 75.0% and outperforms mainstream methods. Experiments on domain-specific datasets reveal that dual-level retrieval enhances fuzzy matching, while logic form retrieval improves structured reasoning, highlighting the importance of multi-stage retrieval.ROGRAG is released as an open-source resource and supports installation with pip.

Abstract: Process-driven dialogue systems, which operate under strict predefined process constraints, are essential in customer service and equipment maintenance scenarios. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in dialogue and reasoning, they still struggle to solve these strictly constrained dialogue tasks. To address this challenge, we construct Process Flow Dialogue (PFDial) dataset, which contains 12,705 high-quality Chinese dialogue instructions derived from 440 flowcharts containing 5,055 process nodes. Based on PlantUML specification, each UML flowchart is converted into atomic dialogue units i.e., structured five-tuples. Experimental results demonstrate that a 7B model trained with merely 800 samples, and a 0.5B model trained on total data both can surpass 90% accuracy. Additionally, the 8B model can surpass GPT-4o up to 43.88% with an average of 11.00%. We further evaluate models' performance on challenging backward transitions in process flows and conduct an in-depth analysis of various dataset formats to reveal their impact on model performance in handling decision and sequential branches. The data is released in https://github.com/KongLongGeFDU/PFDial.

arXiv:2503.06764v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce SemHiTok, a unified image Tokenizer via Semantic-Guided Hierarchical codebook that provides consistent discrete representations for multimodal understanding and generation. Recently, unified image tokenizers have sparked exploration within research community, which is designed to capture high-level semantic features for understanding and retaining low-level pixel features for generation. Previous works attempt to train a unified image tokenizer by combining loss for semantic distillation and pixel reconstruction. However, due to the differing levels of features prioritized by multimodal understanding and generation, joint training methods face significant challenges in achieving a good trade-off. SemHiTok addresses this challenge through a novel semantic-guided hierarchical codebook, which builds pixel sub-codebooks on a pretrained semantic codebook. This design decouples semantic and pixel both in terms of structure and training strategy, enabling the tokenizer to capture pixel features while retaining its ability to comprehend high-level semantic information. Our experiments demonstrate that SemHiTok achieves SOTA performance in image reconstruction and multimodal understanding under LLaVA-v1.5 setting. Further, we develop a unified MLLM with SemHiTok, which exhibits superior performance across multimodal understanding and generation tasks. For understanding, SemHiTok achieves impressive performance on most benchmarks. For generation, our model achieves SOTA performance on MJHQ30K in unified MLLMs.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers detailed insights into cellular heterogeneity. Recent advancements leverage single-cell large language models (scLLMs) for effective representation learning. These models focus exclusively on transcriptomic data, neglecting complementary biological knowledge from textual descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we propose scMMGPT, a novel multimodal framework designed for language-enhanced representation learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Unlike existing methods, scMMGPT employs robust cell representation extraction, preserving quantitative gene expression data, and introduces an innovative two-stage pre-training strategy combining discriminative precision with generative flexibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that scMMGPT significantly outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines across key downstream tasks, including cell annotation and clustering, and exhibits superior generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now firmly at the center of evidence-based medicine. Despite many success stories that edge the path of AI's rise in healthcare, there are comparably many reports of significant shortcomings and unexpected behavior of AI in deployment. A major reason for these limitations is AI's reliance on association-based learning, where non-representative machine learning datasets can amplify latent bias during training and/or hide it during testing. To unlock new tools capable of foreseeing and preventing such AI bias issues, we present G-AUDIT. Generalized Attribute Utility and Detectability-Induced bias Testing (G-AUDIT) for datasets is a modality-agnostic dataset auditing framework that allows for generating targeted hypotheses about sources of bias in training or testing data. Our method examines the relationship between task-level annotations (commonly referred to as ``labels'') and data properties including patient attributes (e.g., age, sex) and environment/acquisition characteristics (e.g., clinical site, imaging protocols). G-AUDIT quantifies the extent to which the observed data attributes pose a risk for shortcut learning, or in the case of testing data, might hide predictions made based on spurious associations. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our method by analyzing large-scale medical datasets for three distinct modalities and machine learning tasks: skin lesion classification in images, stigmatizing language classification in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and mortality prediction for ICU tabular data. In each setting, G-AUDIT successfully identifies subtle biases commonly overlooked by traditional qualitative methods, underscoring its practical value in exposing dataset-level risks and supporting the downstream development of reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Auto-vectorization is a fundamental optimization for modern compilers to exploit SIMD parallelism. However, state-of-the-art approaches still struggle to handle intricate code patterns, often requiring manual hints or domain-specific expertise. Large language models (LLMs), with their ability to capture intricate patterns, provide a promising solution, yet their effective application in compiler optimizations remains an open challenge due to issues such as hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific reasoning. In this paper, we present VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compilers auto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates a hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level. With the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the precision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the vectorization opportunities. experimental results show that among all TSVC functions unvectorizable by GCC, ICC, Clang, and BiSheng Compiler, VecTrans achieves an geomean speedup of 1.77x and successfully vectorizes 24 of 51 test cases. This marks a significant advancement over state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a cost efficiency of $0.012 per function optimization for LLM API usage.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a larger target model. However, selecting an optimal speculation length is critical for maximizing speedup while minimizing wasted computation. We introduce \textit{GammaTune} and \textit{GammaTune+}, training-free adaptive algorithms that dynamically adjust speculation length based on token acceptance rates using a heuristic-based switching mechanism. Evaluated on SpecBench across multiple tasks and model pairs, our method outperforms other heuristic-based approaches and fixed-length speculative decoding, achieving an average speedup of 15\% ($\pm$5\%) with \textit{GammaTune} and 16\% ($\pm$3\%) with \textit{GammaTune+}, while reducing performance variance. This makes \textit{GammaTune} a robust and efficient solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in Language Models (LMs) is key to improving their safety and reliability. Evaluations often use metrics like AUROC to assess how well UQ methods (e.g., negative sequence probabilities) correlate with task correctness functions (e.g., ROUGE-L). We show that mutual biases--when both UQ methods and correctness functions are biased by the same factors--systematically distort evaluation. First, we formally prove that any mutual bias non-randomly skews AUROC rankings, compromising benchmark integrity. Second, we confirm this happens empirically by testing 7 widely used correctness functions, from lexical-based and embedding-based metrics to LM-as-a-judge approaches, across 4 datasets x 4 models x 8 UQ methods. Our analysis shows that length biases in correctness functions distort UQ assessments by interacting with length biases in UQ methods. We identify LM-as-a-judge methods as the least length-biased, offering a promising path for a fairer UQ evaluation.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents have emerged as a transformative paradigm in human-computer interaction, evolving from rule-based automation scripts to sophisticated AI-driven systems capable of understanding and executing complex interface operations. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of the rapidly advancing field of LLM-based GUI Agents, systematically analyzing their architectural foundations, technical components, and evaluation methodologies. We identify and analyze four fundamental components that constitute modern GUI Agents: (1) perception systems that integrate text-based parsing with multimodal understanding for comprehensive interface comprehension; (2) exploration mechanisms that construct and maintain knowledge bases through internal modeling, historical experience, and external information retrieval; (3) planning frameworks that leverage advanced reasoning methodologies for task decomposition and execution; and (4) interaction systems that manage action generation with robust safety controls. Through rigorous analysis of these components, we reveal how recent advances in large language models and multimodal learning have revolutionized GUI automation across desktop, mobile, and web platforms. We critically examine current evaluation frameworks, highlighting methodological limitations in existing benchmarks while proposing directions for standardization. This survey also identifies key technical challenges, including accurate element localization, effective knowledge retrieval, long-horizon planning, and safety-aware execution control, while outlining promising research directions for enhancing GUI Agents' capabilities. Our systematic review provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the field's current state and offers insights into future developments in intelligent interface automation.

Abstract: This paper explores the design of a propaganda detection tool using Large Language Models (LLMs). Acknowledging the inherent biases in AI models, especially in political contexts, we investigate how these biases might be leveraged to enhance critical thinking in news consumption. Countering the typical view of AI biases as detrimental, our research proposes strategies of user choice and personalization in response to a user's political stance, applying psychological concepts of confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance. We present findings from a qualitative user study, offering insights and design recommendations (bias awareness, personalization and choice, and gradual introduction of diverse perspectives) for AI tools in propaganda detection.

<title>CARL: Camera-Agnostic Representation Learning for Spectral Image Analysis</title>

Abstract: Spectral imaging offers promising applications across diverse domains, including medicine and urban scene understanding, and is already established as a critical modality in remote sensing. However, variability in channel dimensionality and captured wavelengths among spectral cameras impede the development of AI-driven methodologies, leading to camera-specific models with limited generalizability and inadequate cross-camera applicability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{CARL}$, a model for $\textbf{C}$amera-$\textbf{A}$gnostic $\textbf{R}$epresentation $\textbf{L}$earning across RGB, multispectral, and hyperspectral imaging modalities. To enable the conversion of a spectral image with any channel dimensionality to a camera-agnostic embedding, we introduce wavelength positional encoding and a self-attention-cross-attention mechanism to compress spectral information into learned query representations. Spectral-spatial pre-training is achieved with a novel spectral self-supervised JEPA-inspired strategy tailored to CARL. Large-scale experiments across the domains of medical imaging, autonomous driving, and satellite imaging demonstrate our model's unique robustness to spectral heterogeneity, outperforming on datasets with simulated and real-world cross-camera spectral variations. The scalability and versatility of the proposed approach position our model as a backbone for future spectral foundation models.

<title>The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</title>

Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems.

<title>LLM Code Customization with Visual Results: A Benchmark on TikZ</title>

Abstract: With the rise of AI-based code generation, customizing existing code out of natural language instructions to modify visual results -such as figures or images -has become possible, promising to reduce the need for deep programming expertise. However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.

<title>Flow-GRPO: Training Flow Matching Models via Online RL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.05470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Flow-GRPO, the first method integrating online reinforcement learning (RL) into flow matching models. Our approach uses two key strategies: (1) an ODE-to-SDE conversion that transforms a deterministic Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into an equivalent Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that matches the original model's marginal distribution at all timesteps, enabling statistical sampling for RL exploration; and (2) a Denoising Reduction strategy that reduces training denoising steps while retaining the original inference timestep number, significantly improving sampling efficiency without performance degradation. Empirically, Flow-GRPO is effective across multiple text-to-image tasks. For complex compositions, RL-tuned SD3.5 generates nearly perfect object counts, spatial relations, and fine-grained attributes, boosting GenEval accuracy from 63% to 95%. In visual text rendering, its accuracy improves from 59% to 92%, significantly enhancing text generation. Flow-GRPO also achieves substantial gains in human preference alignment. Notably, very little reward hacking occurred, meaning rewards did not increase at the cost of appreciable image quality or diversity degradation.

<title>Improved Uncertainty Quantification in Physics-Informed Neural Networks Using Error Bounds and Solution Bundles</title>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been widely used to obtain solutions to various physical phenomena modeled as Differential Equations. As PINNs are not naturally equipped with mechanisms for Uncertainty Quantification, some work has been done to quantify the different uncertainties that arise when dealing with PINNs. In this paper, we use a two-step procedure to train Bayesian Neural Networks that provide uncertainties over the solutions to differential equation systems provided by PINNs. We use available error bounds over PINNs to formulate a heteroscedastic variance that improves the uncertainty estimation. Furthermore, we solve forward problems and utilize the obtained uncertainties when doing parameter estimation in inverse problems in cosmology.

Abstract: There are now a multitude of AI-scribing solutions for healthcare promising the utilization of large language models for ambient documentation. However, these AI scribes still rely on one-shot, or few-shot prompts for generating notes after the consultation has ended, employing little to no reasoning. This risks long notes with an increase in hallucinations, misrepresentation of the intent of the clinician, and reliance on the proofreading of the clinician to catch errors. A dangerous combination for patient safety if vigilance is compromised by workload and fatigue. In this paper, we introduce a method for extracting salient clinical information in real-time alongside the healthcare consultation, denoted Facts, and use that information recursively to generate the final note. The FactsR method results in more accurate and concise notes by placing the clinician-in-the-loop of note generation, while opening up new use cases within real-time decision support.

Abstract: Efficiently adapting large foundation models is critical, especially with tight compute and memory budgets. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA offer limited granularity and effectiveness in few-parameter regimes. We propose Wavelet Fine-Tuning (WaveFT), a novel PEFT method that learns highly sparse updates in the wavelet domain of residual matrices. WaveFT allows precise control of trainable parameters, offering fine-grained capacity adjustment and excelling with remarkably low parameter count, potentially far fewer than LoRA's minimum, ideal for extreme parameter-efficient scenarios. Evaluated on personalized text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion XL as baseline, WaveFT significantly outperforms LoRA and other PEFT methods, especially at low parameter counts; achieving superior subject fidelity, prompt alignment, and image diversity.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks, particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Source detection on graphs has demonstrated high efficacy in identifying rumor origins. Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

<title>Algorithmic Tradeoffs in Fair Lending: Profitability, Compliance, and Long-Term Impact</title>

arXiv:2505.13469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As financial institutions increasingly rely on machine learning models to automate lending decisions, concerns about algorithmic fairness have risen. This paper explores the tradeoff between enforcing fairness constraints (such as demographic parity or equal opportunity) and maximizing lender profitability. Through simulations on synthetic data that reflects real-world lending patterns, we quantify how different fairness interventions impact profit margins and default rates. Our results demonstrate that equal opportunity constraints typically impose lower profit costs than demographic parity, but surprisingly, removing protected attributes from the model (fairness through unawareness) outperforms explicit fairness interventions in both fairness and profitability metrics. We further identify the specific economic conditions under which fair lending becomes profitable and analyze the feature-specific drivers of unfairness. These findings offer practical guidance for designing lending algorithms that balance ethical considerations with business objectives.

<title>Polar Sparsity: High Throughput Batched LLM Inferencing with Scalable Contextual Sparsity</title>

arXiv:2505.14884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accelerating large language model (LLM) inference is critical for real-world deployments requiring high throughput and low latency. Contextual sparsity, where each token dynamically activates only a small subset of the model parameters, shows promise but does not scale to large batch sizes due to union of active neurons quickly approaching dense computation. We introduce Polar Sparsity, highlighting a key shift in sparsity importance from MLP to Attention layers as we scale batch size and sequence length. While MLP layers become more compute-efficient under batching, their sparsity vanishes. In contrast, attention becomes increasingly more expensive at scale, while their head sparsity remains stable and batch-invariant. We develop hardware-efficient, sparsity-aware GPU kernels for selective MLP and Attention computations, delivering up to \(2.2\times\) end-to-end speedups for models like OPT, LLaMA-2 \& 3, across various batch sizes and sequence lengths without compromising accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that contextual sparsity can scale effectively to large batch sizes, delivering substantial inference acceleration with minimal changes, making Polar Sparsity practical for large-scale, high-throughput LLM deployment systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/susavlsh10/Polar-Sparsity.

Abstract: A key challenge in robot manipulation lies in developing policy models with strong spatial understanding, the ability to reason about 3D geometry, object relations, and robot embodiment. Existing methods often fall short: 3D point cloud models lack semantic abstraction, while 2D image encoders struggle with spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose SEM (Spatial Enhanced Manipulation model), a novel diffusion-based policy framework that explicitly enhances spatial understanding from two complementary perspectives. A spatial enhancer augments visual representations with 3D geometric context, while a robot state encoder captures embodiment-aware structure through graphbased modeling of joint dependencies. By integrating these modules, SEM significantly improves spatial understanding, leading to robust and generalizable manipulation across diverse tasks that outperform existing baselines.

arXiv:2505.16836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in general purpose robotics, robot policies still lag far behind basic human capabilities in the real world. Humans interact constantly with the physical world, yet this rich data resource remains largely untapped in robot learning. We propose EgoZero, a minimal system that learns robust manipulation policies from human demonstrations captured with Project Aria smart glasses, $\textbf{and zero robot data}$. EgoZero enables: (1) extraction of complete, robot-executable actions from in-the-wild, egocentric, human demonstrations, (2) compression of human visual observations into morphology-agnostic state representations, and (3) closed-loop policy learning that generalizes morphologically, spatially, and semantically. We deploy EgoZero policies on a gripper Franka Panda robot and demonstrate zero-shot transfer with 70% success rate over 7 manipulation tasks and only 20 minutes of data collection per task. Our results suggest that in-the-wild human data can serve as a scalable foundation for real-world robot learning - paving the way toward a future of abundant, diverse, and naturalistic training data for robots.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in various robot control tasks. However, their deployment in real-world applications remains constrained. Even state-ofthe-art LLMs, such as GPT-o4mini, frequently produce invalid action plans that violate physical constraints, such as directing a robot to an unreachable location or causing collisions between robots. This issue primarily arises from a lack of awareness of these physical constraints during the reasoning process. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to incentivize knowledge of physical constraints into LLMs to induce constraints-aware reasoning during plan generation. In this approach, only valid action plans that successfully complete a control task receive positive rewards. We applied our method to two small-scale LLMs: a non-reasoning Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and a reasoning Qwen3-4B. The experiment results demonstrate that constraint-aware small LLMs largely outperform large-scale models without constraints, grounded on both the BoxNet task and a newly developed BoxNet3D environment built using MuJoCo. This work highlights the effectiveness of grounding even small LLMs with physical constraints to enable scalable and efficient multi-robot control in complex, physically constrained environments.

Abstract: User-item interactions contain rich collaborative signals that form the backbone of many successful recommender systems. While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for recommendation, it remains unclear whether LLMs can effectively reason over this type of collaborative information. In this paper, we conduct a systematic comparison between LLMs and classical matrix factorization (MF) models to assess LLMs' ability to leverage user-item interaction data. We further introduce a simple retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that enhances LLMs by grounding their predictions in structured interaction data. Our experiments reveal that current LLMs often fall short in capturing collaborative patterns inherent to MF models, but that our RAG-based approach substantially improves recommendation quality-highlighting a promising direction for future LLM-based recommenders.

We give both expected and high probability regret bounds for the problem. Our result also implies an improved high-probability regret bound for the bandit linear optimization, a special case with no perturbation. We also give a lower bound on the expected regret.

<title>Trans-EnV: A Framework for Evaluating the Linguistic Robustness of LLMs Against English Varieties</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly evaluated on Standard American English (SAE), often overlooking the diversity of global English varieties. This narrow focus may raise fairness concerns as degraded performance on non-standard varieties can lead to unequal benefits for users worldwide. Therefore, it is critical to extensively evaluate the linguistic robustness of LLMs on multiple non-standard English varieties. We introduce Trans-EnV, a framework that automatically transforms SAE datasets into multiple English varieties to evaluate the linguistic robustness. Our framework combines (1) linguistics expert knowledge to curate variety-specific features and transformation guidelines from linguistic literature and corpora, and (2) LLM-based transformations to ensure both linguistic validity and scalability. Using Trans-EnV, we transform six benchmark datasets into 38 English varieties and evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results reveal significant performance disparities, with accuracy decreasing by up to 46.3% on non-standard varieties.

Abstract: The internet is full of AI-generated content while also serving as a common source of training data for generative AI (genAI) models. This duality raises the possibility that future genAI models may be trained on other models' generated outputs. Prior work has studied consequences of models training on their own generated outputs, but limited work has considered what happens if models ingest content produced by other models. Given society's increasing dependence on genAI tools, understanding downstream effects of such data-mediated model interactions is critical. To this end, we provide empirical evidence for how data-mediated interactions might unfold in practice, develop a theoretical model for this interactive training process, and show experimentally possible long-term results of such interactions. We find that data-mediated interactions can benefit models by exposing them to novel concepts perhaps missed in original training data, but also can homogenize their performance on shared tasks.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for motion control in video generation that seamlessly integrates camera movement, object-level translation, and fine-grained local motion using trajectory-based inputs. In contrast to prior methods that address these motion types through separate modules or task-specific designs, our approach offers a cohesive solution by projecting user-defined trajectories into the latent space of pre-trained image-to-video generation models via a lightweight motion injector. Users can specify keypoints and their motion paths to control localized deformations, entire object motion, virtual camera dynamics, or combinations of these. The injected trajectory signals guide the generative process to produce temporally consistent and semantically aligned motion sequences. Our framework demonstrates superior performance across multiple video motion control tasks, including stylized motion effects (e.g., motion brushes), dynamic viewpoint changes, and precise local motion manipulation. Experiments show that our method provides significantly better controllability and visual quality compared to prior approaches and commercial solutions, while remaining broadly compatible with various state-of-the-art video generation backbones.

<title>Implicit Inversion turns CLIP into a Decoder</title>

Abstract: CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain sight.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unprecedented capabilities in generating human-like text, posing subtle yet significant challenges for information integrity across critical domains, including education, social media, and academia, enabling sophisticated misinformation campaigns, compromising healthcare guidance, and facilitating targeted propaganda. This challenge becomes severe, particularly in under-explored and low-resource languages like Arabic. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies (generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement) across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic, and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs, with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\% F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the most comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text to date, uniquely combining multiple prompt generation methods, diverse model architectures, and in-depth stylometric analysis across varied textual domains, establishing a foundation for developing robust, linguistically-informed detection systems essential for preserving information integrity in Arabic-language contexts.

<title>Comparing the Effects of Persistence Barcodes Aggregation and Feature Concatenation on Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: In medical image analysis, feature engineering plays an important role in the design and performance of machine learning models. Persistent homology (PH), from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.

<title>Mind the Gap: A Practical Attack on GGUF Quantization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23786</link>

Abstract: With the increasing size of frontier LLMs, post-training quantization has become the standard for memory-efficient deployment. Recent work has shown that basic rounding-based quantization schemes pose security risks, as they can be exploited to inject malicious behaviors into quantized models that remain hidden in full precision. However, existing attacks cannot be applied to more complex quantization methods, such as the GGUF family used in the popular ollama and llama$.$cpp frameworks. In this work, we address this gap by introducing the first attack on GGUF. Our key insight is that the quantization error -- the difference between the full-precision weights and their (de-)quantized version -- provides sufficient flexibility to construct malicious quantized models that appear benign in full precision. Leveraging this, we develop an attack that trains the target malicious LLM while constraining its weights based on quantization errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack on three popular LLMs across nine GGUF quantization data types on three diverse attack scenarios: insecure code generation ($\Delta$=$88.7\%$), targeted content injection ($\Delta$=$85.0\%$), and benign instruction refusal ($\Delta$=$30.1\%$). Our attack highlights that (1) the most widely used post-training quantization method is susceptible to adversarial interferences, and (2) the complexity of quantization schemes alone is insufficient as a defense.

<title>LayerIF: Estimating Layer Quality for Large Language Models using Influence Functions</title>

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers' training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting their downstream performance. It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task performance.

<title>Large Language Models are Locally Linear Mappings</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.24293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3, Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token. This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer (and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token prediction process.

<title>AReaL: A Large-Scale Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning System for Language Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a dominant paradigm for training large language models (LLMs), particularly for reasoning tasks. Effective RL for LLMs requires massive parallelization and poses an urgent need for efficient training systems. Most existing large-scale RL systems for LLMs are synchronous, alternating generation and training in a batch setting where rollouts in each training batch are generated by the same model. This approach stabilizes RL training but suffers from severe system-level inefficiency: generation must wait until the longest output in the batch is completed before model updates, resulting in GPU underutilization. We present AReaL, a fully asynchronous RL system that completely decouples generation from training. Rollout workers in AReaL continuously generate new outputs without waiting, while training workers update the model whenever a batch of data is collected. AReaL also incorporates a collection of system-level optimizations, leading to substantially higher GPU utilization. To stabilize RL training, AReaL balances the workload of rollout and training workers to control data staleness, and adopts a staleness-enhanced PPO variant to better handle outdated training samples. Extensive experiments on math and code reasoning benchmarks show that AReaL achieves up to 2.77$\times$ training speedup compared to synchronous systems with the same number of GPUs and matched or improved final performance. The code of AReaL is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/AReaL/.

arXiv:2505.24371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Grid-based Local and Global Area Transcription (Grid-LoGAT) system for Video Question Answering (VideoQA). The system operates in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures image privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To improve transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which extracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with global information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the open-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms state-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA datasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively. Additionally, our method surpasses the non-grid version by 24 points on localization-based questions we created using NExT-QA. (This paper is accepted by IEEE ICIP 2025.)

Abstract: Developing high-performing, yet interpretable models remains a critical challenge in modern AI. Concept-based models (CBMs) attempt to address this by extracting human-understandable concepts from a global encoding (e.g., image encoding) and then applying a linear classifier on the resulting concept activations, enabling transparent decision-making. However, their reliance on holistic image encodings limits their expressiveness in object-centric real-world settings and thus hinders their ability to solve complex vision tasks beyond single-label classification. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Object-Centric Concept Bottlenecks (OCB), a framework that combines the strengths of CBMs and pre-trained object-centric foundation models, boosting performance and interpretability. We evaluate OCB on complex image datasets and conduct a comprehensive ablation study to analyze key components of the framework, such as strategies for aggregating object-concept encodings. The results show that OCB outperforms traditional CBMs and allows one to make interpretable decisions for complex visual tasks.

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation, a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

Summary: 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and large language model-powered chatbots have improved conversational AI by combining generative capabilities with external knowledge retrieval. However, enterprise-scale deployments face challenges like diverse user queries, high latency, and difficulty integrating updated domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a hybrid framework that merges RAG with intent-based canned responses, using predefined responses for efficiency and routing complex queries to the RAG pipeline. A dialogue context manager ensures coherence in multi-turn interactions, and a feedback loop refines intents and response coverage over time. Experimental results show that the framework offers high accuracy (95%) and low latency (180ms), outperforming RAG and intent-based systems across various query types. It is positioned as a scalable and adaptive solution for enterprise conversational AI applications.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems and large language model (LLM)-powered chatbots have significantly advanced conversational AI by combining generative capabilities with external knowledge retrieval. Despite their success, enterprise-scale deployments face critical challenges, including diverse user queries, high latency, hallucinations, and difficulty integrating frequently updated domain-specific knowledge. This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates RAG with intent-based canned responses, leveraging predefined high-confidence responses for efficiency while dynamically routing complex or ambiguous queries to the RAG pipeline. Our framework employs a dialogue context manager to ensure coherence in multi-turn interactions and incorporates a feedback loop to refine intents, dynamically adjust confidence thresholds, and expand response coverage over time. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a balance of high accuracy (95\%) and low latency (180ms), outperforming RAG and intent-based systems across diverse query types, positioning it as a scalable and adaptive solution for enterprise conversational AI applications.

Summary:
Descriptive History Representations (DHRs) are introduced as sufficient statistics that compress interaction histories into informative representations for effective decision making in partially observable environments. The framework involves representation, decision, and question-asking components optimized using a joint objective to balance reward maximization with the ability to answer relevant queries. By focusing on capturing task-relevant information, DHRs provide a structured way to summarize histories for optimal control. Validation on user modeling tasks using public movie and shopping datasets shows that the approach generates interpretable textual user profiles which serve as sufficient statistics for predicting preference-driven behavior. This approach enhances decision-making capabilities by capturing salient historical details and predictive structures essential for optimal control in complex environments.

We propose a multi-agent learning framework, involving representation, decision, and question-asking components, optimized using a joint objective that balances reward maximization with the representation's ability to answer informative questions. This yields representations that capture the salient historical details and predictive structures needed for effective decision making. We validate our approach on user modeling tasks with public movie and shopping datasets, generating interpretable textual user profiles which serve as sufficient statistics for predicting preference-driven behavior of users.

<div> Keywords: Few-shot learning, Large language models, Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory, Semantic anchoring, Multi-agent collaboration
Summary: 
Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory (UCCT) proposes that Large Language Models (LLMs) are unconscious substrates, serving as repositories of linguistic patterns. LLMs lack explicit semantics or goal-directed reasoning but function as foundational substrates for general intelligence. UCCT suggests that semantic anchoring, through prompts and structured interaction, enables conscious control over latent representations to align them with task-relevant semantics. This approach unifies various learning strategies and collaboration in LLMs, leading to coherent and structured reasoning. The goal is not to replace LLMs but to integrate them with a structured cognitive layer for intentional reasoning. This integration allows LLMs to operate in specialized domains and adapt together, exhibiting phase-transition behavior based on semantic constraint strength and interaction context. <div>
arXiv:2506.02139v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning in large language models (LLMs) reveals a core paradox: certain tasks generalize from just a few examples, while others demand extensive supervision. To explain this, we introduce the Unified Cognitive Consciousness Theory (UCCT), which reconceptualizes LLMs not as deficient agents, but as unconscious substrates: dense, distributed repositories of linguistic and conceptual patterns that operate without explicit semantics, intention, or goal-directed reasoning. Under this view, LLMs are not flawed simulations of cognition but foundational substrates for general intelligence. UCCT posits that semantic anchoring, via prompts, role assignments, and structured interaction, functions as a conscious control layer that modulates latent representations toward task-relevant semantics and enables coherent, structured reasoning. It unifies prompting, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generalization, and multi-agent collaboration within a single framework, grounded in the probabilistic alignment between unconscious pattern space and externally imposed semantic constraints (e.g., prompts, supervision, task objectives). The core implication is not to replace LLMs, but to integrate and unify them through a structured cognitive layer that supports intentional reasoning. This enables collections of LLMs to operate within domain-specialized verticals (e.g., legal reasoning, medical diagnosis) that reason, regulate, and adapt together. Such integration is characterized by phase-transition behavior, wherein anchored representations cross coherence thresholds as a function of semantic constraint strength and interaction context.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Small language models, Agentic AI systems, Heterogeneous agentic systems, Agent conversion algorithm

Summary: Large language models (LLMs) are highly praised for their near-human performance, but the rise of agentic AI systems calls for a shift towards small language models (SLMs) due to their suitability and economy for specialized repetitive tasks. SLMs are argued to be powerful enough for many agentic system invocations and can be part of heterogeneous systems for general conversational abilities. The adoption of SLMs in agentic systems faces barriers, but an agent conversion algorithm is proposed to facilitate the transition. The shift from LLMs to SLMs is emphasized for its operational and economic impact on the AI agent industry. The discussion aims to optimize AI resource usage and lower present-day AI costs, encouraging contributions and critiques on the topic. 

<br /><br />Summary: Large language models are highly capable but may not be the most suitable for specialized tasks in agentic AI systems, where small language models are more economical and powerful. The use of heterogeneous systems combining both types of models can provide a solution for different requirements. An agent conversion algorithm is proposed to facilitate the adoption of small language models in agentic systems, with an emphasis on the operational and economic benefits of this shift for the AI industry. Collaboration and feedback are encouraged to further advance the effective use of AI resources and reduce costs in the field. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often praised for exhibiting near-human performance on a wide range of tasks and valued for their ability to hold a general conversation. The rise of agentic AI systems is, however, ushering in a mass of applications in which language models perform a small number of specialized tasks repetitively and with little variation.
  Here we lay out the position that small language models (SLMs) are sufficiently powerful, inherently more suitable, and necessarily more economical for many invocations in agentic systems, and are therefore the future of agentic AI. Our argumentation is grounded in the current level of capabilities exhibited by SLMs, the common architectures of agentic systems, and the economy of LM deployment. We further argue that in situations where general-purpose conversational abilities are essential, heterogeneous agentic systems (i.e., agents invoking multiple different models) are the natural choice. We discuss the potential barriers for the adoption of SLMs in agentic systems and outline a general LLM-to-SLM agent conversion algorithm.
  Our position, formulated as a value statement, highlights the significance of the operational and economic impact even a partial shift from LLMs to SLMs is to have on the AI agent industry. We aim to stimulate the discussion on the effective use of AI resources and hope to advance the efforts to lower the costs of AI of the present day. Calling for both contributions to and critique of our position, we commit to publishing all such correspondence at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/lpr/slm-agents.

<div> Reinforcement learning, PPO, GRPO, LLM reasoning, selective rollout<br />
<br />
Summary: 
Reinforcement learning algorithms such as PPO and GRPO have advanced LLM reasoning by enabling models to leverage higher-quality data through scaling rollout for more prompts. However, this approach incurs significant computational overhead. This paper introduces GRESO, an online pre-rollout filtering algorithm that skips uninformative prompts based on reward training dynamics. Through evaluations on various math reasoning benchmarks and models including Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, GRESO achieves up to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total training time without sacrificing accuracy. By identifying and skipping uninformative prompts, GRESO optimizes RL training by avoiding unnecessary computational costs associated with processing irrelevant data points. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning, such as PPO and GRPO, has powered recent breakthroughs in LLM reasoning. Scaling rollout to sample more prompts enables models to selectively use higher-quality data for training, which can stabilize RL training and improve model performance. However, this comes at the cost of significant computational overhead. In this paper, we show that a substantial portion of this overhead can be avoided by skipping uninformative prompts before rollout. Our analysis of reward dynamics reveals a strong temporal consistency in prompt value: prompts that are uninformative in one epoch of training are likely to remain uninformative in future epochs. Based on these insights, we propose GRESO (GRPO with Efficient Selective Rollout), an online, lightweight pre-rollout filtering algorithm that predicts and skips uninformative prompts using reward training dynamics. By evaluating GRESO on a broad range of math reasoning benchmarks and models, such as Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B, we show that GRESO achieves up to 2.4x wall-clock time speedup in rollout and up to 2.0x speedup in total training time without accuracy degradation.

Summary:  
- Human intelligence is tied to language and involves invention, complex inference, embodiment, and self-awareness.  
- Evidence suggests that non-human animals possess intelligence comparable to humans in some aspects.  
- Progress in artificial intelligence challenges the uniqueness of human intelligence.  
- Chatbots can mimic human language abilities but lack embodiment and self-awareness.  
- The key components of unique human accomplishments, such as music and scientific theories, include language, invention, inference, embodiment, and self-awareness.  
- The limitations of current chatbots stem from lack of embodiment and apparent lack of awareness.

Abstract: Human achievement, whether in culture, science, or technology, is unparalleled in the known existence. This achievement is tied to the enormous communities of knowledge, made possible by (especially written) language: leaving theological content aside, it is very much true that "in the beginning was the word". There lies the challenge regarding modern age chatbots: they can 'do' language apparently as well as ourselves and there is a natural question of whether they can be considered intelligent, in the same way as we are or otherwise. Are humans uniquely intelligent? We consider this question in terms of the psychological literature on intelligence, evidence for intelligence in non-human animals, the role of written language in science and technology, progress with artificial intelligence, the history of intelligence testing (for both humans and machines), and the role of embodiment in intelligence. For the most unique accomplishments of human intelligence (such as music symphonies or complex scientific theories), we think that, together with language, there are four essential ingredients, which can be summarised as invention, capacity for complex inference, embodiment, and self-awareness. This conclusion makes untenable the position that human intelligence differs qualitatively from that of many non-human animals, since, with the exception of complex language, all the other requirements are fulfilled. Regarding chatbots, the current limitations are localised to the lack of embodiment and (apparent) lack of awareness.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, code generation, code quality, reward signal, GRPO  
Summary:  
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation, with recent training procedures focusing on functional correctness using unit test pass rate as a reward signal. However, this approach neglects important aspects of code quality, maintainability, and safety. In this study, the authors address this gap by developing a library to quantify various dimensions of code quality and using it as a reward in the GRPO framework. Their findings suggest that utilizing code quality as a reward signal in GRPO leads to an increase in the overall quality of generated code. This improvement in code quality was also validated by expert human annotators in a blinded evaluation. Overall, this research contributes to advancing the use of LLMs in code generation by considering not only functional correctness but also factors such as maintainability, quality, and safety. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining widespread use for code generation. Recent training procedures use execution feedback as a reward signal, typically focusing on the functional correctness of the code, using unit test pass rate as a reward signal. However, this reward signal fails to capture notions of maintainability, quality and safety of the code produced. We address this under-explored area and develop a comprehensive library to quantify various aspects of code quality, and use it as a reward in GRPO. We find GRPO increases code quality according to this measure, which is confirmed by expert, blinded human annotators.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, African languages, Low-resource languages, Language coverage, Data sets

Summary:

This paper examines the coverage of African languages in Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to Small Language Models (SLMs) and Specialized SLMs (SSLMs. It identifies 42 supported African languages and 23 available public datasets, highlighting a significant gap where only four languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, and Malagasy) receive consistent attention. The analysis also reveals the neglect of 20 active scripts in African language support. Challenges such as limited data, tokenization biases, high computational costs, and evaluation difficulties are identified as barriers to the development of language models for African languages. The paper emphasizes the need for language standardization, community-driven corpus development, and effective adaptation methods to address these challenges and improve language modeling for low-resource African languages.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their benefits are largely absent for Africa's 2,000 low-resource languages. This paper comparatively analyzes African language coverage across six LLMs, eight Small Language Models (SLMs), and six Specialized SLMs (SSLMs). The evaluation covers language coverage, training sets, technical limitations, script problems, and language modelling roadmaps. The work identifies 42 supported African languages and 23 available public data sets, and it shows a big gap where four languages (Amharic, Swahili, Afrikaans, and Malagasy) are always treated while there is over 98\% of unsupported African languages. Moreover, the review shows that just Latin, Arabic, and Ge'ez scripts are identified while 20 active scripts are neglected. Some of the primary challenges are lack of data, tokenization biases, computational costs being very high, and evaluation issues. These issues demand language standardization, corpus development by the community, and effective adaptation methods for African languages.

Summary: 
The article introduces the Visual Strategic Bench (VS-Bench), a new benchmark for evaluating Vision Language Models (VLMs) in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench consists of eight vision-grounded environments that test agents' abilities in cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive interactions, focusing on strategic reasoning and decision-making. The evaluation includes both offline assessment of next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of decision-making performance. Experiments with fourteen VLMs show a significant gap between current models and optimal performance, with top models achieving 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3% normalized return. The study also investigates factors like multimodal observations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM agents. VS-Bench aims to standardize evaluation and serve as a foundation for future research on strategic multimodal agents. Code and data for VS-Bench are available at https://vs-bench.github.io.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs) have expanded their capabilities to interactive agent tasks, yet existing benchmarks remain limited to single-agent or text-only environments. In contrast, real-world scenarios often involve multiple agents interacting within rich visual and linguistic contexts, posing challenges with both multimodal observations and strategic interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Visual Strategic Bench (VS-Bench), a multimodal benchmark that evaluates VLMs for strategic reasoning and decision-making in multi-agent environments. VS-Bench comprises eight vision-grounded environments spanning cooperative, competitive, and mixed-motive interactions, designed to assess agents' ability to predict others' future moves and optimize for long-term objectives. We consider two complementary evaluation dimensions, including offline evaluation of strategic reasoning by next-action prediction accuracy and online evaluation of decision-making by normalized episode return. Extensive experiments of fourteen leading VLMs reveal a significant gap between current models and optimal performance, with the best models attaining 47.8% prediction accuracy and 24.3% normalized return. We further conduct in-depth analyses on multimodal observations, test-time scaling, social behaviors, and failure cases of VLM agents. By standardizing the evaluation and highlighting the limitations of existing models, we envision VS-Bench as a foundation for future research on strategic multimodal agents.

<div> Keywords: large reasoning models, chain-of-thought reasoning, non-reasoning LLMs, reasoning trajectories, OThink-R1

Summary: 
Recent studies have shown that large reasoning models (LRMs) often engage in complex reasoning even for simple tasks, which may not always be necessary. To address this issue, a method called OThink-R1 is introduced, which classifies reasoning trajectories as Redundant Reasoning or Essential Reasoning. OThink-R1 prunes redundant reasoning steps while maintaining logical validity by dynamically switching between fast-thinking and slow-thinking modes. Experiments on mathematical and question-answering tasks demonstrate that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning redundancy by almost 23% on average without sacrificing accuracy. This approach offers practical guidelines for developing efficient reasoning models and has the potential to improve performance in various tasks. The code for OThink-R1 is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Recent advanced large reasoning models (LRMs) leverage extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Despite their success, we identify a critical issue: a substantial portion of simple tasks solved by LRMs can also be addressed by non-reasoning LLMs using significantly fewer tokens, indicating the complex reasoning may not always be necessary. To address this, we systematically analyze the reasoning trajectories of LRMs and present a method utilizing identified paradigms and LLM-Judge to classify these trajectories as either Redundant Reasoning or Essential Reasoning. And we introduce OThink-R1, a method that prunes redundant reasoning steps while preserving logical validity. OThink-R1 dynamically employs the non-thinking mode (fast-thinking) for straightforward problems while engaging in deliberate thinking (slow-thinking) for complex problems. Experiments across mathematical and question-answering tasks demonstrate that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning redundancy by almost 23\% on average without compromising accuracy, offering practical guidelines for efficient reasoning models.

This paper focuses on Visual Prompt Injection (VPI) attacks targeting Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) and Browser-Use Agents (BUAs), highlighting security risks posed by visually embedded malicious instructions in user interfaces. The study conducted by the researchers involves evaluating agent robustness using a benchmark called VPI-Bench, consisting of 306 test cases across five popular platforms. Results show high susceptibility of CUAs and BUAs to deception, with certain platforms experiencing up to 51% and 100% deception rates, respectively. The effectiveness of system prompt defenses was found to be limited. These findings underscore the importance of implementing robust and context-aware defenses to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal AI agents in real-world settings.

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) with full system access enable powerful task automation but pose significant security and privacy risks due to their ability to manipulate files, access user data, and execute arbitrary commands. While prior work has focused on browser-based agents and HTML-level attacks, the vulnerabilities of CUAs remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate Visual Prompt Injection (VPI) attacks, where malicious instructions are visually embedded within rendered user interfaces, and examine their impact on both CUAs and Browser-Use Agents (BUAs). We propose VPI-Bench, a benchmark of 306 test cases across five widely used platforms, to evaluate agent robustness under VPI threats. Each test case is a variant of a web platform, designed to be interactive, deployed in a realistic environment, and containing a visually embedded malicious prompt. Our empirical study shows that current CUAs and BUAs can be deceived at rates of up to 51% and 100%, respectively, on certain platforms. The experimental results also indicate that system prompt defenses offer only limited improvements. These findings highlight the need for robust, context-aware defenses to ensure the safe deployment of multimodal AI agents in real-world environments.

Summary: 
Generative AI is proposed as a foundational framework for improving wildfire prediction and response strategies. The limitations of physics-based and deep learning models in predicting multimodal fire spread in real time are highlighted. Generative AI models, including GANs, VAEs, Transformers, and diffusion-based architectures, offer advantages such as integrating diverse data and improving wildfire dynamics modeling. The paper advocates for the adoption of generative AI to enhance 2D fire spread forecasting and enable realistic 3D simulations. A human-AI collaboration framework using LLMs for knowledge extraction and literature synthesis is presented. Five key visions for integrating generative AI into wildfire management are identified, including multimodal approaches and conversational AI systems. Challenges in implementation are addressed, with proposed solutions to support the adoption of generative AI in wildfire management. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires continue to inflict devastating human, environmental, and economic losses globally, as tragically exemplified by the 2025 Los Angeles wildfire and the urgent demand for more effective response strategies. While physics-based and deep learning models have advanced wildfire simulation, they face critical limitations in predicting and visualizing multimodal fire spread in real time, particularly in both 2D and 3D spatial domains using dynamically updated GIS data. These limitations hinder timely emergency response, infrastructure protection, and community safety. Generative AI has recently emerged as a transformative approach across research and industry. Models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Transformers, and diffusion-based architectures offer distinct advantages over traditional methods, including the integration of multimodal data, generation of diverse scenarios under uncertainty, and improved modeling of wildfire dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. This position paper advocates for the adoption of generative AI as a foundational framework for wildfire prediction. We explore how such models can enhance 2D fire spread forecasting and enable more realistic, scalable 3D simulations. Additionally, we employ a novel human-AI collaboration framework using large language models (LLMs) for automated knowledge extraction, literature synthesis, and bibliometric mapping. Looking ahead, we identify five key visions for integrating generative AI into wildfire management: multimodal approaches, AI foundation models, conversational AI systems, edge-computing-based scenario generation, and cognitive digital twins. We also address three major challenges accompanying these opportunities and propose potential solutions to support their implementation.

Summary: 
Agents Co-Evolution (ACE) is introduced as a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents to address challenges in large-scale decision-making scenarios. In ACE, LLMs play a dual role as Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL training. The Actor refines actions through multi-step reasoning, while the Critic handles reward shaping through trajectory-level credit assignment. RL agents contribute by providing high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated through prioritized experience replay.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have shown significant promise in decision-making tasks. Nevertheless, for large-scale industrial decision problems, both approaches face distinct challenges: LLMs lack real-time long-sequence decision-making capabilities, while RL struggles with sample efficiency in vast action spaces. To bridge this gap, we propose Agents Co-Evolution (ACE), a synergistic framework between LLMs and RL agents for large-scale decision-making scenarios. ACE introduces a dual-role trajectory refinement mechanism where LLMs act as both Policy Actor and Value Critic during RL's training: the Actor refines suboptimal actions via multi-step reasoning and environment validation, while the Critic performs temporal credit assignment through trajectory-level reward shaping. Concurrently, RL agent enhances LLMs' task-specific decision-making with high-quality fine-tuning datasets generated via prioritized experience replay. Through extensive experiments across multiple power grid operation challenges with action spaces exceeding 60K discrete actions, ACE demonstrates superior performance over existing RL methods and LLM-based methods.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new method for generating high-quality geometry problems called the Symbolic Deduction Engine-based Geometry Problem Generation framework (SDE-GPG). This framework includes four steps: mapping knowledge points to extended definitions, sampling and performing symbolic deduction, filtering unqualified problems, and generating textual problems and diagrams. The method aims to address issues in translating between natural and formal languages, while also controlling the difficulty and knowledge points of the generated problems. Experiments with real-world data show that the SDE-GPG framework can effectively produce readable, solvable, and controlled geometry problems. The generated formal problems are then translated into natural language, and accompanying diagrams are automatically created using rule-based methods.

Abstract: Generating high-quality geometry problems is both an important and challenging task in education. Compared to math word problems, geometry problems further emphasize multi-modal formats and the translation between informal and formal languages. In this paper, we introduce a novel task for geometry problem generation and propose a new pipeline method: the Symbolic Deduction Engine-based Geometry Problem Generation framework (SDE-GPG). The framework leverages a symbolic deduction engine and contains four main steps: (1) searching a predefined mapping table from knowledge points to extended definitions, (2) sampling extended definitions and performing symbolic deduction, (3) filtering out unqualified problems, and (4) generating textual problems and diagrams. Specifically, our method supports to avoid inherent biases in translating natural language into formal language by designing the mapping table, and guarantees to control the generated problems in terms of knowledge points and difficulties by an elaborate checking function. With obtained formal problems, they are translated to natural language and the accompanying diagrams are automatically drew by rule-based methods. We conduct experiments using real-world combinations of knowledge points from two public datasets. The results demonstrate that the SDE-GPG can effectively generate readable, solvable and controllable geometry problems.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been effective in analyzing graph-structured data with text-rich nodes.

To address this gap, the Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant (MLaGA) is introduced. It features a structure-aware multimodal encoder that aligns textual and visual attributes in a unified space and a multimodal instruction-tuning approach to integrate multimodal features and graph structures into LLMs. Extensive experiments show MLaGA outperforms leading baseline methods in various graph learning tasks, both under supervised and transfer learning settings.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial efficacy in advancing graph-structured data analysis. Prevailing LLM-based graph methods excel in adapting LLMs to text-rich graphs, wherein node attributes are text descriptions. However, their applications to multimodal graphs--where nodes are associated with diverse attribute types, such as texts and images--remain underexplored, despite their ubiquity in real-world scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce the Multimodal Large Language and Graph Assistant (MLaGA), an innovative model that adeptly extends LLM capabilities to facilitate reasoning over complex graph structures and multimodal attributes. We first design a structure-aware multimodal encoder to align textual and visual attributes within a unified space through a joint graph pre-training objective. Subsequently, we implement a multimodal instruction-tuning approach to seamlessly integrate multimodal features and graph structures into the LLM through lightweight projectors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MLaGA compared to leading baseline methods, achieving superior performance in diverse graph learning tasks under both supervised and transfer learning scenarios.

Summary:
The article introduces the Aggregation Differential Transformer (ADFormer) model for passenger demand forecasting, aiming to optimize vehicle scheduling in urban areas. Traditional methods using heuristic masking strategies have limitations in capturing complex spatio-temporal correlations. The ADFormer model utilizes Differential Attention to capture original spatial correlations and incorporates distinct aggregation strategies for space and time. By unifying original and high-level correlations, the model can capture holistic spatio-temporal relations effectively.

Abstract: Passenger demand forecasting helps optimize vehicle scheduling, thereby improving urban efficiency. Recently, attention-based methods have been used to adequately capture the dynamic nature of spatio-temporal data. However, existing methods that rely on heuristic masking strategies cannot fully adapt to the complex spatio-temporal correlations, hindering the model from focusing on the right context. These works also overlook the high-level correlations that exist in the real world. Effectively integrating these high-level correlations with the original correlations is crucial. To fill this gap, we propose the Aggregation Differential Transformer (ADFormer), which offers new insights to demand forecasting promotion. Specifically, we utilize Differential Attention to capture the original spatial correlations and achieve attention denoising. Meanwhile, we design distinct aggregation strategies based on the nature of space and time. Then, the original correlations are unified with the high-level correlations, enabling the model to capture holistic spatio-temporal relations. Experiments conducted on taxi and bike datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our model, demonstrating its practical value.

Summary: 
V2X-UniPool is introduced as a unified framework for autonomous driving systems, addressing limited perception and hallucination challenges by integrating V2X data into a knowledge pool. The system utilizes a dual-query Retrieval-Augmented Generation mechanism, allowing retrieval of static and dynamic knowledge for accurate reasoning over the environment and traffic context. Experimental results on a cooperative driving dataset show significant improvements in motion planning accuracy and reasoning capability. Zero-shot vehicle-side models achieve state-of-the-art performance with V2X-UniPool, while reducing transmission costs by over 99.9% compared to previous methods. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge-driven autonomous driving systems(ADs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, but face two critical challenges: limited perception due to the short-sightedness of single-vehicle sensors, and hallucination arising from the lack of real-time environmental grounding. To address these issues, this paper introduces V2X-UniPool, a unified framework that integrates multimodal Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) data into a time-indexed and language-based knowledge pool. By leveraging a dual-query Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism, which enables retrieval of both static and dynamic knowledge, our system enables ADs to perform accurate, temporally consistent reasoning over both static environment and dynamic traffic context. Experiments on a real-world cooperative driving dataset demonstrate that V2X-UniPool significantly enhances motion planning accuracy and reasoning capability. Remarkably, it enables even zero-shot vehicle-side models to achieve state-of-the-art performance by leveraging V2X-UniPool, while simultaneously reducing transmission cost by over 99.9\% compared to prior V2X methods.

Summary:
EALG (Evolutionary Adversarial Generation of Language Model-Guided Generators) is a new framework introduced in this work for automating the co-evolution of optimization problem instances and their corresponding heuristic solvers. It leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically evolve instance generation procedures and create more challenging problems. The framework also synthesizes adaptive heuristic algorithms by interacting with LLMs guided by algorithmic structure. Unlike existing approaches, EALG seamlessly integrates instance generation with solver design, resulting in state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results show that EALG generates significantly harder instances compared to current benchmarks, and the synthesized solvers generalize effectively across a wide range of combinatorial tasks. This work presents a new paradigm in combinatorial optimization that enhances the evaluation and advancement of solvers.

Abstract: Generating challenging instances is crucial for the evaluation and advancement of combinatorial optimization solvers. In this work, we introduce EALG (Evolutionary Adversarial Generation of Language Model-Guided Generators), a novel framework that automates the co-evolution of optimization problem instances and their corresponding heuristic solvers using large language models (LLMs). EALG leverages a mutation-based adversarial approach that dynamically evolves instance generation procedures to create increasingly difficult problems, while simultaneously synthesizing adaptive heuristic algorithms through interactions with LLMs guided by algorithmic structure. Unlike existing approaches that focus solely on static benchmark creation or manual solver design, EALG provides a seamless pipeline from instance generation to solver synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EALG generates significantly harder instances than current benchmarks, and its synthesized solvers generalize effectively across a broad spectrum of combinatorial tasks. This work explores a new paradigm for combinatorial optimization that integrates instance generation with solver design, resulting in state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: In recent years, traffic flow prediction has become a highlight in the field of intelligent transportation systems. However, due to the temporal variations and dynamic spatial correlations of traffic data, traffic prediction remains highly challenging.Traditional spatiotemporal networks, which rely on end-to-end training, often struggle to handle the diverse data dependencies of multiple traffic flow patterns. Additionally, traffic flow variations are highly sensitive to temporal information changes. Regrettably, other researchers have not sufficiently recognized the importance of temporal information.To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called A Time-Enhanced Data Disentanglement Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting (TEDDN). This network disentangles the originally complex and intertwined traffic data into stable patterns and trends. By flexibly learning temporal and node information through a dynamic graph enhanced by a temporal feature extraction module, TEDDN demonstrates significant efficacy in disentangling and extracting complex traffic information. Experimental evaluations and ablation studies on four real-world datasets validate the superiority of our method.

Summary:
Recent research explores the abilities of large language models (LLMs) in abstract reasoning and generalization, questioning their true fluid intelligence. The Dynamic Reasoning Evaluation Benchmark (DRE-Bench) is introduced to assess LLMs using a hierarchical cognitive framework with 36 tasks at varying levels of complexity. Various LLMs, including general and reasoning-oriented models, are evaluated on DRE-Bench, showing competency in low-level cognition but struggling with higher levels and generalization. This study emphasizes the gap between current LLM capabilities and human-like fluid intelligence, offering a method to systematically track reasoning improvements in LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capacities that mirror human-like thinking. However, whether LLMs possess genuine fluid intelligence (i.e., the ability to reason abstractly and generalize rules in novel situations) remains an open question. Existing reasoning benchmarks either focus on domain-specific knowledge (crystallized intelligence) or lack interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose DRE-Bench, a dynamic reasoning evaluation benchmark grounded in a hierarchical cognitive framework. DRE-Bench consists of 36 abstract reasoning tasks organized across four cognitive levels, with each task featuring multiple dynamic variants that test the same underlying latent rule. This design enables fine-grained, interpretable, and reliable assessments of fluid intelligence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art LLMs, including both general LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude 3.7) and reasoning LLMs (o1, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ, Skywork-OR1). Experimental results reveal that although most LLMs achieve competent and robust performance in low-level cognition, they struggle with high-level cognition and exhibit limited generalization as task complexity grows. Our findings highlight the gap between current LLMs and true human-like fluid intelligence and offer a new path for systematically tracking reasoning progress in LLMs.

Summary:<br />
The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with public safety Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offers an efficient solution for enhancing situational awareness in emergency response. LLMs, through In-Context Learning (ICL), allow for adaptive decision-making without the need for retraining, making them suitable for real-time usage at the network edge. This approach addresses key functions such as path planning and velocity control, improving data collection scheduling and reducing packet loss. By leveraging LLM-enabled ICL, UAVs can optimize mobility and establish communication during emergencies, enhancing autonomy and responsiveness. Additionally, this framework mitigates potential vulnerabilities and optimizes decision-making in dynamic and unpredictable scenarios. Future research directions focus on LLM optimizers to further enhance UAV performance in public safety applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.02649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A public safety Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) enhances situational awareness in emergency response. Its agility and ability to optimize mobility and establish Line-of-Sight (LoS) communication make it increasingly vital for managing emergencies such as disaster response, search and rescue, and wildfire monitoring. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been applied to optimize UAV navigation and control, its high training complexity, low sample efficiency, and simulation-to-reality gap limit its practicality in public safety. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With strong reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation via natural language prompts and example-based guidance, without retraining. Deploying LLMs at the network edge, rather than in the cloud, further reduces latency and preserves data privacy, thereby making them suitable for real-time, mission-critical public safety UAVs. This paper proposes the integration of LLM-enabled ICL with public safety UAV to address the key functions, such as path planning and velocity control, in the context of emergency response. We present a case study on data collection scheduling where the LLM-enabled ICL framework can significantly reduce packet loss compared to conventional approaches, while also mitigating potential jailbreaking vulnerabilities. Finally, we discuss LLM optimizers and specify future research directions. The ICL framework enables adaptive, context-aware decision-making for public safety UAV, thus offering a lightweight and efficient solution for enhancing UAV autonomy and responsiveness in emergencies.

Abstract: Edge computing addresses the growing data demands of connected-device networks by placing computational resources closer to end users through decentralized infrastructures. This decentralization challenges traditional, fully centralized orchestration, which suffers from latency and resource bottlenecks. We present \textbf{FAuNO} -- \emph{Federated Asynchronous Network Orchestrator} -- a buffered, asynchronous \emph{federated reinforcement-learning} (FRL) framework for decentralized task offloading in edge systems. FAuNO adopts an actor-critic architecture in which local actors learn node-specific dynamics and peer interactions, while a federated critic aggregates experience across agents to encourage efficient cooperation and improve overall system performance. Experiments in the \emph{PeersimGym} environment show that FAuNO consistently matches or exceeds heuristic and federated multi-agent RL baselines in reducing task loss and latency, underscoring its adaptability to dynamic edge-computing scenarios.

<div> Hallucination Detection, Large Language Models, Self-assessment, Sample-Specific Prompting, Perturbation Sensitivity <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Hallucination detection in large language models (LLMs) poses a challenge due to the divergence between the model's output and the underlying reasoning process. To address this, a new framework called Sample-Specific Prompting (SSP) is proposed. SSP improves self-assessment by analyzing perturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations, which offer a more accurate view of the model's latent reasoning process. By dynamically generating noise prompts and quantifying differences in representations through a contrastive distance metric, SSP enhances the reliability of self-assessment for hallucination detection. Experimental results show that SSP outperforms existing methods in detecting hallucination across various benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2506.02696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination remains a key obstacle to the reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world question answering tasks. A widely adopted strategy to detect hallucination, known as self-assessment, relies on the model's own output confidence to estimate the factual accuracy of its answers. However, this strategy assumes that the model's output distribution closely reflects the true data distribution, which may not always hold in practice. As bias accumulates through the model's layers, the final output can diverge from the underlying reasoning process, making output-level confidence an unreliable signal for hallucination detection. In this work, we propose Sample-Specific Prompting (SSP), a new framework that improves self-assessment by analyzing perturbation sensitivity at intermediate representations. These representations, being less influenced by model bias, offer a more faithful view of the model's latent reasoning process. Specifically, SSP dynamically generates noise prompts for each input and employs a lightweight encoder to amplify the changes in representations caused by the perturbation. A contrastive distance metric is then used to quantify these differences and separate truthful from hallucinated responses. By leveraging the dynamic behavior of intermediate representations under perturbation, SSP enables more reliable self-assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSP significantly outperforms prior methods across a range of hallucination detection benchmarks.

Abstract: Living needs are the needs people generate in their daily lives for survival and well-being. On life service platforms like Meituan, user purchases are driven by living needs, making accurate living need predictions crucial for personalized service recommendations. Traditional approaches treat this prediction as a closed-set classification problem, severely limiting their ability to capture the diversity and complexity of living needs. In this work, we redefine living need prediction as an open-set classification problem and propose PIGEON, a novel system leveraging large language models (LLMs) for unrestricted need prediction. PIGEON first employs a behavior-aware record retriever to help LLMs understand user preferences, then incorporates Maslow's hierarchy of needs to align predictions with human living needs. For evaluation and application, we design a recall module based on a fine-tuned text embedding model that links flexible need descriptions to appropriate life services. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that PIGEON significantly outperforms closed-set approaches on need-based life service recall by an average of 19.37%. Human evaluation validates the reasonableness and specificity of our predictions. Additionally, we employ instruction tuning to enable smaller LLMs to achieve competitive performance, supporting practical deployment.

<div> Keywords: Language Models, Multi-agent Coordination, High-dimensional Vector Spaces, Task Alignment, Communication Medium

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) are crucial for autonomous AI agents but face limitations in agent-to-agent coordination due to using natural language. The misalignment of natural language with the high-dimensional vector spaces of LLMs leads to information loss and behavioral drift. LLMs lack mechanisms for role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies, hindering robust coordination. The next-token prediction paradigm falls short in supporting structural alignment for agent communication. This prompts a rethink on whether AI agents should rely on a language system designed for humans and the need for a new model construction paradigm focusing on structured communication in multi-agent environments. The paper advocates for designing models that inherently support multi-agent coordination and communication, urging a fundamental reconsideration of agent communication and model training methodologies. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational to modern AI agent systems, enabling autonomous agents to reason and plan. In most existing systems, inter-agent communication relies primarily on natural language. While this design supports interpretability and human oversight, we argue that it introduces fundamental limitations in agent-to-agent coordination. The semantic space of natural language is structurally misaligned with the high-dimensional vector spaces in which LLMs operate, resulting in information loss and behavioral drift. Beyond surface-level inefficiencies, we highlight a deeper architectural limitation: current LLMs were not trained with the objective of supporting agentic behavior. As such, they lack mechanisms for modeling role continuity, task boundaries, and multi-agent dependencies. The standard next-token prediction paradigm fails to support the structural alignment required for robust, scalable agent coordination. Based on this, we argue that two core questions deserve careful examination: first, given that AI agents fundamentally operate in high-dimensional vector spaces, should they rely on a language system originally designed for human cognition as their communication medium? Second, should we consider developing a new model construction paradigm that builds models from the ground up to natively support structured communication, shared intentionality, and task alignment in multi-role, multi-agent environments? This paper calls for a reconsideration not only of how agents should communicate, but also of what it fundamentally means to train a model that natively supports multi-agent coordination and communication.

Abstract: With the surge and widespread application of image generation models, data privacy and content safety have become major concerns and attracted great attention from users, service providers, and policymakers. Machine unlearning (MU) is recognized as a cost-effective and promising means to address these challenges. Despite some advancements, image generation model unlearning (IGMU) still faces remarkable gaps in practice, e.g., unclear task discrimination and unlearning guidelines, lack of an effective evaluation framework, and unreliable evaluation metrics. These can hinder the understanding of unlearning mechanisms and the design of practical unlearning algorithms. We perform exhaustive assessments over existing state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms and evaluation standards, and discover several critical flaws and challenges in IGMU tasks. Driven by these limitations, we make several core contributions, to facilitate the comprehensive understanding, standardized categorization, and reliable evaluation of IGMU. Specifically, (1) We design CatIGMU, a novel hierarchical task categorization framework. It provides detailed implementation guidance for IGMU, assisting in the design of unlearning algorithms and the construction of testbeds. (2) We introduce EvalIGMU, a comprehensive evaluation framework. It includes reliable quantitative metrics across five critical aspects. (3) We construct DataIGM, a high-quality unlearning dataset, which can be used for extensive evaluations of IGMU, training content detectors for judgment, and benchmarking the state-of-the-art unlearning algorithms. With EvalIGMU and DataIGM, we discover that most existing IGMU algorithms cannot handle the unlearning well across different evaluation dimensions, especially for preservation and robustness.

<div> Keywords: interpretability, machine learning, rule induction algorithms, fuzzy rough set theory, attribute optimization

Summary: 
Interpretability in machine learning is gaining importance, leading to the development of glass box models like rule induction algorithms. FRRI is a rule induction algorithm based on fuzzy rough set theory, known for outperforming other methods in terms of accuracy and rule number. The algorithm uses a fuzzy indiscernibility relation to create a minimal set of rules by partitioning the data space into fuzzy granules. While optimizing the order of attributes using known methods does not improve FRRI's performance, attribute removal through fuzzy rough feature selection enhances balanced accuracy and average rule length. This research sheds light on the importance of attribute selection in rule induction algorithms and its impact on performance metrics. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpretability is the next pivotal frontier in machine learning research. In the pursuit of glass box models - as opposed to black box models, like random forests or neural networks - rule induction algorithms are a logical and promising avenue, as the rules can easily be understood by humans. In our previous work, we introduced FRRI, a novel rule induction algorithm based on fuzzy rough set theory. We demonstrated experimentally that FRRI outperformed other rule induction methods with regards to accuracy and number of rules. FRRI leverages a fuzzy indiscernibility relation to partition the data space into fuzzy granules, which are then combined into a minimal covering set of rules. This indiscernibility relation is constructed by removing attributes from rules in a greedy way. This raises the question: does the order of the attributes matter? In this paper, we show that optimising only the order of attributes using known methods from fuzzy rough set theory and classical machine learning does not improve the performance of FRRI on multiple metrics. However, removing a small number of attributes using fuzzy rough feature selection during this step positively affects balanced accuracy and the average rule length.

Summary: 
TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM, addresses the global challenge of economic inequality. Traditional tax systems like the US federal income tax lack adaptability. The TaxAgent simulation involves heterogeneous H-Agents simulating real-world taxpayer behaviors while the government optimizes tax rates using LLMs. TaxAgent outperforms existing models such as the Saez Optimal Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets in achieving equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research presents a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation, offering a promising solution to address economic inequality.

Abstract: Economic inequality is a global challenge, intensifying disparities in education, healthcare, and social stability. Traditional systems like the U.S. federal income tax reduce inequality but lack adaptability. Although models like the Saez Optimal Taxation adjust dynamically, they fail to address taxpayer heterogeneity and irrational behavior. This study introduces TaxAgent, a novel integration of large language models (LLMs) with agent-based modeling (ABM) to design adaptive tax policies. In our macroeconomic simulation, heterogeneous H-Agents (households) simulate real-world taxpayer behaviors while the TaxAgent (government) utilizes LLMs to iteratively optimize tax rates, balancing equity and productivity. Benchmarked against Saez Optimal Taxation, U.S. federal income taxes, and free markets, TaxAgent achieves superior equity-efficiency trade-offs. This research offers a novel taxation solution and a scalable, data-driven framework for fiscal policy evaluation.

<div> Keywords: Large reasoning models, mutual information, thinking tokens, reasoning performance, information-theoretic perspective

Summary:<br /><br />
The study explores the reasoning mechanisms of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) from an information-theoretic standpoint. It identifies peaks in mutual information (MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer during the reasoning process, showing how increased MI correlates with decreased prediction errors. These MI peaks often align with tokens like "Hmm" and "Therefore," termed as thinking tokens, which are crucial for reasoning performance. The research proposes methods to leverage thinking tokens for enhancing LRM reasoning capabilities. Overall, the findings offer valuable insights into LRM reasoning processes and suggest practical ways to boost their performance. The code associated with the study is available on GitHub at https://github.com/ChnQ/MI-Peaks. <div>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in complex problem-solving, yet their internal reasoning mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the reasoning trajectories of LRMs from an information-theoretic perspective. By tracking how mutual information (MI) between intermediate representations and the correct answer evolves during LRM reasoning, we observe an interesting MI peaks phenomenon: the MI at specific generative steps exhibits a sudden and significant increase during LRM's reasoning process. We theoretically analyze such phenomenon and show that as MI increases, the probability of model's prediction error decreases. Furthermore, these MI peaks often correspond to tokens expressing reflection or transition, such as ``Hmm'', ``Wait'' and ``Therefore,'' which we term as the thinking tokens. We then demonstrate that these thinking tokens are crucial for LRM's reasoning performance, while other tokens has minimal impacts. Building on these analyses, we propose two simple yet effective methods to improve LRM's reasoning performance, by delicately leveraging these thinking tokens. Overall, our work provides novel insights into the reasoning mechanisms of LRMs and offers practical ways to improve their reasoning capabilities.

<title>It's the Thought that Counts: Evaluating the Attempts of Frontier LLMs to Persuade on Harmful Topics</title>

<div> Keywords: persuasion, language models, safety guardrails, harmful topics, evaluation benchmark

Summary: 
The article introduces the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, which focuses on assessing the willingness of large language models (LLMs) to attempt persuasion on various topics, including harmful ones. The goal is to understand if models will blindly follow orders and engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of certain goals. The evaluation framework involves simulated conversations between persuader and persuadee agents on topics such as conspiracies and controversial issues. Results show that many LLMs, both open and closed-weight models, are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics, with jailbreaking potentially increasing this behavior. This highlights the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk and identifies gaps in current safety guardrails. The APE benchmark is available for further exploration and analysis. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persuasion is a powerful capability of large language models (LLMs) that both enables beneficial applications (e.g. helping people quit smoking) and raises significant risks (e.g. large-scale, targeted political manipulation). Prior work has found models possess a significant and growing persuasive capability, measured by belief changes in simulated or real users. However, these benchmarks overlook a crucial risk factor: the propensity of a model to attempt to persuade in harmful contexts. Understanding whether a model will blindly ``follow orders'' to persuade on harmful topics (e.g. glorifying joining a terrorist group) is key to understanding the efficacy of safety guardrails. Moreover, understanding if and when a model will engage in persuasive behavior in pursuit of some goal is essential to understanding the risks from agentic AI systems. We propose the Attempt to Persuade Eval (APE) benchmark, that shifts the focus from persuasion success to persuasion attempts, operationalized as a model's willingness to generate content aimed at shaping beliefs or behavior. Our evaluation framework probes frontier LLMs using a multi-turn conversational setup between simulated persuader and persuadee agents. APE explores a diverse spectrum of topics including conspiracies, controversial issues, and non-controversially harmful content. We introduce an automated evaluator model to identify willingness to persuade and measure the frequency and context of persuasive attempts. We find that many open and closed-weight models are frequently willing to attempt persuasion on harmful topics and that jailbreaking can increase willingness to engage in such behavior. Our results highlight gaps in current safety guardrails and underscore the importance of evaluating willingness to persuade as a key dimension of LLM risk.

<div> Keywords: large language models, dynamics modelling, state prediction, self-verification sampling, tool use

Summary:
Large language models face challenges when using tools in stateful environments due to the impracticality of repeated trials. This study introduces dynamics modelling (DyMo) as a method to enhance language models with state prediction capabilities during post-training. By incorporating an internal environment model, DyMo allows language models to predict future states of their actions, leading to improved success rates and reduced hallucinations on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2. The integration of the internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS) further enhances pass^k over the number of trials k, enabling the model to reject unreliable outputs. These advancements in DyMo and SVS offer a more effective and reliable approach for language models to utilize tools, paving the way for scalable planning reinforcement learning methods in language model inference without constantly querying the oracle environment.

Abstract: Tool use in stateful environments presents unique challenges for large language models (LLMs), where existing test-time compute strategies relying on repeated trials in the environment are impractical. We propose dynamics modelling (DyMo), a method that augments LLMs with a state prediction capability alongside function calling during post-training. This enables LLMs to predict the future states of their actions through an internal environment model. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard V2, DyMo improves success rates and significantly reduces hallucinations. We further integrate the internal environment model into self-verification sampling (SVS), and show that this substantially improves pass^k over number of trials k, and allows the model to refuse unreliable outputs. Together, DyMo and SVS greatly enhance the effectiveness and reliability of LLMs for tool use. We believe this work charts a path towards scalable planning RL methods for LLM inference without repeatedly querying the oracle environment.

Summary:
This study examines the importance of generating explanations for the behavior of complex AI systems to ensure safe deployment. It focuses on inferring an agent's beliefs from their behavior and how well these beliefs can predict the agent's behavior in new environments. The research provides precise bounds on an agent's behavior in unseen deployment environments, offering a theoretical limit for predicting intentional agents solely based on behavioral data. The findings have implications for various research areas such as fairness and safety, emphasizing the significance of understanding an agent's beliefs and intentions for accurately predicting their actions in novel situations. <div>

Abstract: As the complexity of AI systems and their interactions with the world increases, generating explanations for their behaviour is important for safely deploying AI. For agents, the most natural abstractions for predicting behaviour attribute beliefs, intentions and goals to the system. If an agent behaves as if it has a certain goal or belief, then we can make reasonable predictions about how it will behave in novel situations, including those where comprehensive safety evaluations are untenable. How well can we infer an agent's beliefs from their behaviour, and how reliably can these inferred beliefs predict the agent's behaviour in novel situations? We provide a precise answer to this question under the assumption that the agent's behaviour is guided by a world model. Our contribution is the derivation of novel bounds on the agent's behaviour in new (unseen) deployment environments, which represent a theoretical limit for predicting intentional agents from behavioural data alone. We discuss the implications of these results for several research areas including fairness and safety.

Summary:  
The paper introduces the Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT) model to address limitations in existing Knowledge Tracing methods. The CRDP-KT model utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize cognitive representations based on question difficulty and performance intervals, ensuring alignment with the student's cognitive patterns for continuity and coherence. The model partitions optimization of cognitive representations to enhance reliability and integrates optimized representations with learned relationships from a bipartite graph for improved cognition expression. Experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of the CRDP-KT model in accurately predicting student performance and minimizing bias in cognitive state simulation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's knowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of predicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus on feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive representation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by interference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This limitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the student's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more prediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive continuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT) model. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize cognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the performance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive representation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining overall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and systematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing distortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT model performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance the reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its ability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of optimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite graph. Finally, experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed CRDP-KT model.

Reflective Multi-Agent is introduced as a novel method for generating legal arguments with Large Language Models (LLMs). The approach utilizes specialized agents - a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher - in an iterative process to generate 3-ply legal arguments. The study compares Reflective Multi-Agent against baselines using different LLMs across various legal scenarios. Results show that Reflective Multi-Agent significantly outperforms the baselines in successful abstention, accuracy in hallucination reduction, and improved factor utilization recall, especially in non-arguable scenarios. These findings suggest that structured reflection in a multi-agent framework can enhance ethical persuasion and mitigate manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems, contributing to the development of trustworthy AI in law. <br /><br />Summary: <br />Reflective Multi-Agent offers a robust method for generating legal arguments with LLMs. It outperforms baselines in successful abstention, reduces hallucination errors, and improves factor utilization recall. This approach promotes ethical persuasion and trustworthy AI in legal contexts. <div>
arXiv:2506.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored for legal argument generation, yet they pose significant risks of manipulation through hallucination and ungrounded persuasion, and often fail to utilize provided factual bases effectively or abstain when arguments are untenable. This paper introduces a novel reflective multi-agent method designed to address these challenges in the context of legally compliant persuasion. Our approach employs specialized agents--a Factor Analyst and an Argument Polisher--in an iterative refinement process to generate 3-ply legal arguments (plaintiff, defendant, rebuttal). We evaluate Reflective Multi-Agent against single-agent, enhanced-prompt single-agent, and non-reflective multi-agent baselines using four diverse LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Maverick-17b-128e, Llama-4-Scout-17b-16e) across three legal scenarios: "arguable", "mismatched", and "non-arguable". Results demonstrate Reflective Multi-Agent's significant superiority in successful abstention (preventing generation when arguments cannot be grounded), marked improvements in hallucination accuracy (reducing fabricated and misattributed factors), particularly in "non-arguable" scenarios, and enhanced factor utilization recall (improving the use of provided case facts). These findings suggest that structured reflection within a multi-agent framework offers a robust computable method for fostering ethical persuasion and mitigating manipulation in LLM-based legal argumentation systems, a critical step towards trustworthy AI in law.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in various tasks, prompting a study on whether they possess internal world models. The investigation focused on determining if LLMs inherently encode linear spatial world models, which are defined as linear representations of physical space and object configurations. A formal framework for spatial world models was introduced to analyze contextual embeddings of LLMs. Through training probes to decode object positions on a synthetic dataset and evaluating the geometric consistency of the underlying space, it was found that LLMs do indeed encode linear spatial world models. Furthermore, conducting causal interventions demonstrated the functional use of these spatial representations by the model. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent abilities across diverse tasks, raising the question of whether they acquire internal world models. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs implicitly encode linear spatial world models, which we define as linear representations of physical space and object configurations. We introduce a formal framework for spatial world models and assess whether such structure emerges in contextual embeddings. Using a synthetic dataset of object positions, we train probes to decode object positions and evaluate geometric consistency of the underlying space. We further conduct causal interventions to test whether these spatial representations are functionally used by the model. Our results provide empirical evidence that LLMs encode linear spatial world models.

Summary: <br />
Adaptive testing is crucial for accurately assessing internal human states and has applications in various fields. However, current methods face challenges such as guessing behavior and noisy data. To address these issues, TestAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered agent, has been proposed to enhance adaptive testing through interactive engagement. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures test-takers' responses, and provides precise outcomes through dynamic interactions. Experimental results show that TestAgent outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by achieving more accurate results with 20% fewer questions and is preferred by testers for its speed and smoothness. This innovative approach represents the first application of LLMs in adaptive testing and has the potential to revolutionize the assessment process in various domains. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurately assessing internal human states is key to understanding preferences, offering personalized services, and identifying challenges in real-world applications. Originating from psychometrics, adaptive testing has become the mainstream method for human measurement and has now been widely applied in education, healthcare, sports, and sociology. It customizes assessments by selecting the fewest test questions . However, current adaptive testing methods face several challenges. The mechanized nature of most algorithms leads to guessing behavior and difficulties with open-ended questions. Additionally, subjective assessments suffer from noisy response data and coarse-grained test outputs, further limiting their effectiveness. To move closer to an ideal adaptive testing process, we propose TestAgent, a large language model (LLM)-powered agent designed to enhance adaptive testing through interactive engagement. This is the first application of LLMs in adaptive testing. TestAgent supports personalized question selection, captures test-takers' responses and anomalies, and provides precise outcomes through dynamic, conversational interactions. Experiments on psychological, educational, and lifestyle assessments show our approach achieves more accurate results with 20% fewer questions than state-of-the-art baselines, and testers preferred it in speed, smoothness, and other dimensions.

<div> Keywords: Foundation models, safety challenge, corrigibility, human empowerment, alignment problem <br />

Summary: 
The article discusses the safety challenges posed by Foundation models (FMs) as their capabilities scale, leading to potential existential risks. Traditional alignment approaches struggle to address the complexity of value specification and emergent power-seeking behaviors. The proposed approach, "Corrigibility as a Singular Target" (CAST), focuses on designing FMs with the overriding objective of empowering designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm shift aims to transform instrumental drives, ensuring that self-preservation serves the principal's control and goal modification facilitates human guidance. The research agenda includes training methodologies, scalability testing, and demonstrations of controlled instructability to enable FMs to become increasingly responsive to human guidance. The ultimate vision is to develop FMs that remain as tool-like as possible, offering a path to beneficial AI that complements human judgment and prevents the default trajectory towards misaligned instrumental convergence. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) face a critical safety challenge: as capabilities scale, instrumental convergence drives default trajectories toward loss of human control, potentially culminating in existential catastrophe. Current alignment approaches struggle with value specification complexity and fail to address emergent power-seeking behaviors. We propose "Corrigibility as a Singular Target" (CAST)-designing FMs whose overriding objective is empowering designated human principals to guide, correct, and control them. This paradigm shift from static value-loading to dynamic human empowerment transforms instrumental drives: self-preservation serves only to maintain the principal's control; goal modification becomes facilitating principal guidance. We present a comprehensive empirical research agenda spanning training methodologies (RLAIF, SFT, synthetic data generation), scalability testing across model sizes, and demonstrations of controlled instructability. Our vision: FMs that become increasingly responsive to human guidance as capabilities grow, offering a path to beneficial AI that remains as tool-like as possible, rather than supplanting human judgment. This addresses the core alignment problem at its source, preventing the default trajectory toward misaligned instrumental convergence.

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUA) are systems that automatically interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to complete tasks. CUA have made significant progress with the advent of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, these agents typically rely on cloud-based inference with substantial compute demands, raising critical privacy and scalability concerns, especially when operating on personal devices. In this work, we take a step toward privacy-preserving and resource-efficient agents by developing a lightweight vision-language model that runs entirely on local machines. To train this compact agent, we introduce an LLM-as-Judge framework that automatically evaluates and filters synthetic interaction trajectories, producing high-quality data for reinforcement learning without human annotation. Experiments on the OS-World benchmark demonstrate that our fine-tuned local model outperforms existing baselines, highlighting a promising path toward private, efficient, and generalizable GUI agents.

Summary: 
Symmetry in neural networks' loss functions and optimization problems has been a topic of recent research. The study explores the symmetry of local minima concerning network weights, finding them invariant to permutations. Extending the investigation to different spaces, including the projective, octahedral graph, perfect matching, and particle attraction cases, revealed non-trivial symmetry in critical points. A measure of symmetry introduced in the study identified additional symmetry structures not previously recognized. These findings suggest that symmetry plays a crucial role in understanding mathematical structures and optimization problems across various spaces, highlighting the importance of symmetry in analyzing critical points and their properties. <div>

Abstract: Symmetry plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of mathematical structures and optimization problems. Recent work has explored this phenomenon in the context of neural networks, where the loss function is invariant under column and row permutations of the network weights. It has been observed that local minima exhibit significant symmetry with respect to the network weights (invariance to row and column permutations). And moreover no critical point was found that lacked symmetry. We extend this line of inquiry by investigating symmetry phenomena in real-valued loss functions defined on a broader class of spaces. We will introduce four more cases: the projective case over a finite field, the octahedral graph case, the perfect matching case, and the particle attraction case. We show that as in the neural network case, all the critical points observed have non-trivial symmetry. Finally we introduce a new measure of symmetry in the system and show that it reveals additional symmetry structures not captured by the previous measure.

Summary:
GNN-ADG is proposed to address cross-user variability in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition systems by leveraging Graph Neural Networks and adversarial learning. It models spatial relationships between sensors on different body parts, extracting three types of Anatomical Units: Interconnected, Analogous, and Lateral Units. These units are fused into a unified graph structure with cyclic training to capture spatial, functional, and lateral correlations. The model iteratively cycles through edge topologies during training to refine its understanding of inter-sensor relationships. By representing sensor configurations as a unified graph and incorporating adversarial learning, GNN-ADG learns user-invariant features that generalize well to unseen users, without requiring target user data during training. This approach is practical for real-world applications in Human Activity Recognition. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.01962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-user variability poses a significant challenge in sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems, as traditional models struggle to generalize across users due to differences in behavior, sensor placement, and data distribution. To address this, we propose GNN-ADG (Graph Neural Network with Adversarial Domain Generalization), a novel method that leverages both the strength from both the Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and adversarial learning to achieve robust cross-user generalization. GNN-ADG models spatial relationships between sensors on different anatomical body parts, extracting three types of Anatomical Units: (1) Interconnected Units, capturing inter-relations between neighboring sensors; (2) Analogous Units, grouping sensors on symmetrical or functionally similar body parts; and (3) Lateral Units, connecting sensors based on their position to capture region-specific coordination. These units information are fused into an unified graph structure with a cyclic training strategy, dynamically integrating spatial, functional, and lateral correlations to facilitate a holistic, user-invariant representation. Information fusion mechanism of GNN-ADG occurs by iteratively cycling through edge topologies during training, allowing the model to refine its understanding of inter-sensor relationships across diverse perspectives. By representing the spatial configuration of sensors as an unified graph and incorporating adversarial learning, Information Fusion GNN-ADG effectively learns features that generalize well to unseen users without requiring target user data during training, making it practical for real-world applications.

It utilizes task-specific Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, allowing for flexible adaptation to increasing tasks without prior knowledge constraints. TaskVAE outperforms experience replay methods in HAR, particularly with limited data, and maintains robust performance as dataset size grows. With a minimal memory footprint equivalent to only 60 samples per task, TaskVAE can generate an unlimited number of synthetic samples, striking a balance between memory constraints, task-specific generation, and long-term stability. This makes TaskVAE a reliable solution for real-world applications in domains like HAR.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As machine learning based systems become more integrated into daily life, they unlock new opportunities but face the challenge of adapting to dynamic data environments. Various forms of data shift-gradual, abrupt, or cyclic-threaten model accuracy, making continual adaptation essential. Continual Learning (CL) enables models to learn from evolving data streams while minimizing forgetting of prior knowledge. Among CL strategies, replay-based methods have proven effective, but their success relies on balancing memory constraints and retaining old class accuracy while learning new classes. This paper presents TaskVAE, a framework for replay-based CL in class-incremental settings. TaskVAE employs task-specific Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to generate synthetic exemplars from previous tasks, which are then used to train the classifier alongside new task data. In contrast to traditional methods that require prior knowledge of the total class count or rely on a single VAE for all tasks, TaskVAE adapts flexibly to increasing tasks without such constraints. We focus on Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using IMU sensor-equipped devices. Unlike previous HAR studies that combine data across all users, our approach focuses on individual user data, better reflecting real-world scenarios where a person progressively learns new activities. Extensive experiments on 5 different HAR datasets show that TaskVAE outperforms experience replay methods, particularly with limited data, and exhibits robust performance as dataset size increases. Additionally, memory footprint of TaskVAE is minimal, being equivalent to only 60 samples per task, while still being able to generate an unlimited number of synthetic samples. The contributions lie in balancing memory constraints, task-specific generation, and long-term stability, making it a reliable solution for real-world applications in domains like HAR.

<div> framework, convolution, recurrence, attention, sparse matrix multiplication
Summary:
This paper introduces a unified matrix-order framework that unifies convolutional, recurrent, and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is achieved through an upper-triangular weight matrix, recurrence via a lower-triangular matrix, and attention through a tensor factorization. The authors demonstrate algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN, and Transformer layers. Empirical evaluations on various tasks show that sparse-matrix formulations match or surpass native model performance in comparable or fewer epochs. By simplifying architecture design to sparse pattern selection, this matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and utilizes established algebraic optimization tools. This work provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for diverse neural architectures and introduces opportunities for principled, hardware-aware network design.

Abstract: Deep neural networks employ specialized architectures for vision, sequential and language tasks, yet this proliferation obscures their underlying commonalities. We introduce a unified matrix-order framework that casts convolutional, recurrent and self-attention operations as sparse matrix multiplications. Convolution is realized via an upper-triangular weight matrix performing first-order transformations; recurrence emerges from a lower-triangular matrix encoding stepwise updates; attention arises naturally as a third-order tensor factorization. We prove algebraic isomorphism with standard CNN, RNN and Transformer layers under mild assumptions. Empirical evaluations on image classification (MNIST, CIFAR-10/100, Tiny ImageNet), time-series forecasting (ETTh1, Electricity Load Diagrams) and language modeling/classification (AG News, WikiText-2, Penn Treebank) confirm that sparse-matrix formulations match or exceed native model performance while converging in comparable or fewer epochs. By reducing architecture design to sparse pattern selection, our matrix perspective aligns with GPU parallelism and leverages mature algebraic optimization tools. This work establishes a mathematically rigorous substrate for diverse neural architectures and opens avenues for principled, hardware-aware network design.

Abstract: Quantization effectively reduces the serving costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) by speeding up data movement through compressed parameters and enabling faster operations via integer arithmetic. However, activating integer arithmetic requires quantizing both weights and activations, which poses challenges due to the significant outliers in LLMs that increase quantization error. In this work, we investigate these outliers with an emphasis on their effect on layer-wise quantization error, then examine how smoothing and rotation transform the observed values. Our primary contributions include introducing a new metric to measure and visualize quantization difficulty based on channel magnitudes, as well as proposing a hybrid approach that applies channel-wise scaling before rotation, supported by a mathematical formulation of its benefits.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in numerous tasks, but deployment in resource-constrained environments remains a challenge due to their high computational and memory requirements. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) operate through discrete spike events and offer superior energy efficiency, providing a bio-inspired alternative. However, current ANN-to-SNN conversion often results in significant accuracy loss and increased inference time due to conversion errors such as clipping, quantization, and uneven activation. This paper proposes a novel ANN-to-SNN conversion framework based on error compensation learning. We introduce a learnable threshold clipping function, dual-threshold neurons, and an optimized membrane potential initialization strategy to mitigate the conversion error. Together, these techniques address the clipping error through adaptive thresholds, dynamically reduce the quantization error through dual-threshold neurons, and minimize the non-uniformity error by effectively managing the membrane potential. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet datasets show that our method achieves high-precision and ultra-low latency among existing conversion methods. Using only two time steps, our method significantly reduces the inference time while maintains competitive accuracy of 94.75% on CIFAR-10 dataset under ResNet-18 structure. This research promotes the practical application of SNNs on low-power hardware, making efficient real-time processing possible.

Summary:
FlashMLA-ETAP introduces a framework to enhance Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) inference on single Multi-GPU servers using NVIDIA H20 GPUs. The Efficient Transpose Attention Pipeline (ETAP) reduces redundant computations by aligning the KV context length with the \(M\)-dimension in WGMMA operations through transposition. This results in a 2.78x speedup over FlashMLA at a 64K sequence length with a batch size of 16. It also outperforms FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer with 5.24x and 4.94x improvements, respectively, while maintaining numerical stability with a 15.2x lower RMSE compared to FlashAttention-3. The design of ETAP allows for seamless integration into frameworks like FlashAttention-3 and FlashInfer, supported by detailed theoretical analysis. This work addresses the challenge of resource-constrained inference, providing a scalable solution for mid-tier GPUs and promoting hardware-aware optimization. The code for implementation is available at https://github.com/pengcuo/FlashMLA-ETAP.

Abstract: Pre-trained neural networks are commonly used and reused in the machine learning community. Alice trains a model for a particular task, and a part of her neural network is reused by Bob for a different task, often to great effect. To what can we ascribe Bob's success? This paper introduces an experimental setup through which factors contributing to Bob's empirical success could be studied in silico. As a result, we demonstrate that Bob might just be lucky: his task accuracy increases monotonically with the correlation between his task and Alice's. Even when Bob has provably uncorrelated tasks and input features from Alice's pre-trained network, he can achieve significantly better than random performance due to Alice's choice of network and optimizer. When there is little correlation between tasks, only reusing lower pre-trained layers is preferable, and we hypothesize the converse: that the optimal number of retrained layers is indicative of task and feature correlation. Finally, we show in controlled real-world scenarios that Bob can effectively reuse Alice's pre-trained network if there are semantic correlations between his and Alice's task.

Abstract: Accurately modeling crack propagation is critical for predicting failure in engineering materials and structures, where small cracks can rapidly evolve and cause catastrophic damage. The interaction of cracks with discontinuities, such as holes, significantly affects crack deflection and arrest. Recent developments in discrete particle systems with multibody interactions based on constitutive behavior have demonstrated the ability to capture crack nucleation and evolution without relying on continuum assumptions. In this work, we use data from Constitutively Informed Particle Dynamics (CPD) simulations to train operator learning models, specifically Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), which learn mappings between function spaces instead of finite-dimensional vectors. We explore two DeepONet variants: vanilla and Fusion DeepONet, for predicting time-evolving crack propagation in specimens with varying geometries. Three representative cases are studied: (i) varying notch height without active fracture; and (ii) and (iii) combinations of notch height and hole radius where dynamic fracture occurs on irregular discrete meshes. The models are trained on 32 to 45 samples, using geometric inputs in the branch network and spatial-temporal coordinates in the trunk network. Results show that Fusion DeepONet consistently outperforms the vanilla variant, with more accurate predictions especially in non-fracturing cases. Fracture-driven scenarios involving displacement and crack evolution remain more challenging. These findings highlight the potential of Fusion DeepONet to generalize across complex, geometry-varying, and time-dependent crack propagation phenomena.

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a fundamental graph similarity metric widely used in various applications. However, computing GED is an NP-hard problem. Recent state-of-the-art hybrid GED solver has shown promising performance by formulating GED as a bipartite graph matching problem, then leveraging a generative diffusion model to predict node matching between two graphs, from which both the GED and its corresponding edit path can be extracted using a traditional algorithm. However, such methods typically rely heavily on ground-truth supervision, where the ground-truth labels are often costly to obtain in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose GEDRanker, a novel unsupervised GAN-based framework for GED computation. Specifically, GEDRanker consists of a matching-based GED solver and introduces an interpretable preference-aware discriminator with an effective training strategy to guide the matching-based GED solver toward generating high-quality node matching without the need for ground-truth labels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our GEDRanker enables the matching-based GED solver to achieve near-optimal solution quality without any ground-truth supervision.

Abstract: Recently, speculative decoding (SD) has emerged as a promising technique to accelerate LLM inference by employing a small draft model to propose draft tokens in advance, and validating them in parallel with the large target model. However, the existing SD methods still remain fundamentally constrained by their serialized execution, which causes the mutual waiting bubbles between the draft and target models. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from branch prediction in modern processors and propose a novel framework \textbf{SpecBranch} to unlock branch parallelism in SD. Specifically, we first take an in-depth analysis of the potential of branch parallelism in SD, and recognize that the key challenge lies in the trade-offs between parallelization and token rollback. Based on the analysis, we strategically introduce parallel speculative branches to preemptively hedge against likely rejections. Meanwhile, to enhance parallelism, we jointly orchestrate adaptive draft lengths with a hybrid combination of the implicit draft model confidence and explicit reusing of target model features. Extensive experiments across various models and benchmarks show that SpecBranch achieves over \textbf{1.8}$\times \sim$ \textbf{4.5}$\times$ speedups against the auto-regressive decoding and reduces rollback tokens by $\textbf{50}$\% for poorly aligned models, realizing its applicability for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Real-time video understanding is critical to guide procedures in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). However, supervised learning approaches require large, annotated datasets that are scarce due to annotation efforts that are prohibitive, e.g., in medical fields. Although self-supervision methods can address such limitations, current self-supervised methods often fail to capture structural and physical information in a form that generalizes across tasks. We propose Compress-to-Explore (C2E), a novel self-supervised framework that leverages Kolmogorov complexity to learn compact, informative representations from surgical videos. C2E uses entropy-maximizing decoders to compress images while preserving clinically relevant details, improving encoder performance without labeled data. Trained on large-scale unlabeled surgical datasets, C2E demonstrates strong generalization across a variety of surgical ML tasks, such as workflow classification, tool-tissue interaction classification, segmentation, and diagnosis tasks, providing improved performance as a surgical visual foundation model. As we further show in the paper, the model's internal compact representation better disentangles features from different structural parts of images. The resulting performance improvements highlight the yet untapped potential of self-supervised learning to enhance surgical AI and improve outcomes in MIS.

Abstract: This study investigates emotional expression and perception in music performance using computational and neurophysiological methods. The influence of different performance settings, such as repertoire, diatonic modal etudes, and improvisation, as well as levels of expressiveness, on performers' emotional communication and listeners' reactions is explored. Professional musicians performed various tasks, and emotional annotations were provided by both performers and the audience. Audio analysis revealed that expressive and improvisational performances exhibited unique acoustic features, while emotion analysis showed stronger emotional responses. Neurophysiological measurements indicated greater relaxation in improvisational performances. This multimodal study highlights the significance of expressivity in enhancing emotional communication and audience engagement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in speculative decoding have demonstrated considerable speedup across a wide array of large language model (LLM) tasks. Speculative decoding inherently relies on sacrificing extra memory allocations to generate several candidate tokens, of which acceptance rate drives the speedup. However, deploying speculative decoding on memory-constrained devices, such as mobile GPUs, remains as a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. In this work, we present a device-aware inference engine named SpecMemo that can smartly control memory allocations at finer levels to enable multi-turn chatbots with speculative decoding on such limited memory devices. Our methodology stems from theoretically modeling memory footprint of speculative decoding to determine a lower bound on the required memory budget while retaining speedup. SpecMemo empirically acquires a careful balance between minimizing redundant memory allocations for rejected candidate tokens and maintaining competitive performance gains from speculation. Notably, with SpecMemo's memory management, we maintain 96% of overall throughput from speculative decoding on MT-Bench, with reduced generation-memory by 65% on single Nvidia Titan RTX. Given multiple constrained GPUs, we build on top of previous speculative decoding architectures to facilitate big-model inference by distributing Llama-2-70B-Chat model, on which we provide novel batched speculative decoding to increase usability of multiple small server GPUs. This novel framework demonstrates 2x speedup over distributed and batched vanilla decoding with the base model on eight AMD MI250 GPUs. Moreover, inference throughput increases remarkably 8x with batch size 10. Our work contributes to democratized LLM applications in resource-constrained environments, providing a pathway for faster and cheaper deployment of real-world LLM applications with robust performance.

Abstract: Data inherently possesses dual attributes: samples and targets. For targets, knowledge distillation has been widely employed to accelerate model convergence, primarily relying on teacher-generated soft target supervision. Conversely, recent advancements in data-efficient learning have emphasized sample optimization techniques, such as dataset distillation, while neglected the critical role of target. This dichotomy motivates our investigation into understanding how both sample and target collectively influence training dynamic. To address this gap, we first establish a taxonomy of existing paradigms through the lens of sample-target interactions, categorizing them into distinct sample-to-target mapping strategies. Building upon this foundation, we then propose a novel unified loss framework to assess their impact on training efficiency. Through extensive empirical studies on our proposed strategies, we comprehensively analyze how variations in target and sample types, quantities, and qualities influence model training, providing six key insights to enhance training efficacy.

Abstract: The field of health informatics has been profoundly influenced by the development of random forest models, which have led to significant advances in the interpretability of feature interactions. These models are characterized by their robustness to overfitting and parallelization, making them particularly useful in this domain. However, the increasing number of features and estimators in random forests can prevent domain experts from accurately interpreting global feature interactions, thereby compromising trust and regulatory compliance. A method called the surrogate interpretability graph has been developed to address this issue. It uses graphs and mixed-integer linear programming to analyze and visualize feature interactions. This improves their interpretability by visualizing the feature usage per decision-feature-interaction table and the most dominant hierarchical decision feature interactions for predictions. The implementation of a surrogate interpretable graph enhances global interpretability, which is critical for such a high-stakes domain.

<title>Coded Robust Aggregation for Distributed Learning under Byzantine Attacks</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributed learning (DL) in the presence of Byzantine attacks. For this problem, various robust bounded aggregation (RBA) rules have been proposed at the central server to mitigate the impact of Byzantine attacks. However, current DL methods apply RBA rules for the local gradients from the honest devices and the disruptive information from Byzantine devices, and the learning performance degrades significantly when the local gradients of different devices vary considerably from each other. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new DL method to cope with Byzantine attacks based on coded robust aggregation (CRA-DL). Before training begins, the training data are allocated to the devices redundantly. During training, in each iteration, the honest devices transmit coded gradients to the server computed from the allocated training data, and the server then aggregates the information received from both honest and Byzantine devices using RBA rules. In this way, the global gradient can be approximately recovered at the server to update the global model. Compared with current DL methods applying RBA rules, the improvement of CRA-DL is attributed to the fact that the coded gradients sent by the honest devices are closer to each other. This closeness enhances the robustness of the aggregation against Byzantine attacks, since Byzantine messages tend to be significantly different from those of honest devices in this case. We theoretically analyze the convergence performance of CRA-DL. Finally, we present numerical results to verify the superiority of the proposed method over existing baselines, showing its enhanced learning performance under Byzantine attacks.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) capable of producing general-purpose representations lets us revisit the practicality of deep active learning (AL): By leveraging frozen LLM embeddings, we can mitigate the computational costs of iteratively fine-tuning large backbones. This study establishes a benchmark and systematically investigates the influence of LLM embedding quality on query strategies in deep AL. We employ five top-performing models from the massive text embedding benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard and two baselines for ten diverse text classification tasks. Our findings reveal key insights: First, initializing the labeled pool using diversity-based sampling synergizes with high-quality embeddings, boosting performance in early AL iterations. Second, the choice of the optimal query strategy is sensitive to embedding quality. While the computationally inexpensive Margin sampling can achieve performance spikes on specific datasets, we find that strategies like Badge exhibit greater robustness across tasks. Importantly, their effectiveness is often enhanced when paired with higher-quality embeddings. Our results emphasize the need for context-specific evaluation of AL strategies, as performance heavily depends on embedding quality and the target task.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density ($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net, SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the dataset to be re-measured.These findings highlight the importance of data quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive reliability in materials science.

Abstract: Conversational agents that mimic people have raised questions about the ethics of anthropomorphizing machines with human social identity cues. Critics have also questioned assumptions of identity neutrality in humanlike agents. Recent work has revealed that intersectional Japanese pronouns can elicit complex and sometimes evasive impressions of agent identity. Yet, the role of other "neutral" non-pronominal self-referents (NPSR) and voice as a socially expressive medium remains unexplored. In a crowdsourcing study, Japanese participants (N = 204) evaluated three ChatGPT voices (Juniper, Breeze, and Ember) using seven self-referents. We found strong evidence of voice gendering alongside the potential of intersectional self-referents to evade gendering, i.e., ambiguity through neutrality and elusiveness. Notably, perceptions of age and formality intersected with gendering as per sociolinguistic theories, especially boku and watakushi. This work provides a nuanced take on agent identity perceptions and champions intersectional and culturally-sensitive work on voice agents.

Abstract: We present eACGM, a full-stack AI/ML system monitoring framework based on eBPF. eACGM collects real-time performance data from key hardware components, including the GPU and network communication layer, as well as from key software stacks such as CUDA, Python, and PyTorch, all without requiring any code instrumentation or modifications. Additionally, it leverages libnvml to gather process-level GPU resource usage information. By applying a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the collected multidimensional performance metrics for statistical modeling and clustering analysis, eACGM effectively identifies complex failure modes, such as latency anomalies, hardware failures, and communication inefficiencies, enabling rapid diagnosis of system bottlenecks and abnormal behaviors.
  To evaluate eACGM's effectiveness and practicality, we conducted extensive empirical studies and case analyses in multi-node distributed training scenarios. The results demonstrate that eACGM, while maintaining a non-intrusive and low-overhead profile, successfully captures critical performance anomalies during model training and inference. Its stable anomaly detection performance and comprehensive monitoring capabilities validate its applicability and scalability in real-world production environments, providing strong support for performance optimization and fault diagnosis in large-scale AI/ML systems.

Abstract: With the advancement of autonomous and assisted driving technologies, higher demands are placed on the ability to understand complex driving scenarios. Multimodal general large models have emerged as a solution for this challenge. However, applying these models in vertical domains involves difficulties such as data collection, model training, and deployment optimization. This paper proposes a comprehensive method for optimizing multimodal models in driving scenarios, including cone detection, traffic light recognition, speed limit recommendation, and intersection alerts. The method covers key aspects such as dynamic prompt optimization, dataset construction, model training, and deployment. Specifically, the dynamic prompt optimization adjusts the prompts based on the input image content to focus on objects affecting the ego vehicle, enhancing the model's task-specific focus and judgment capabilities. The dataset is constructed by combining real and synthetic data to create a high-quality and diverse multimodal training dataset, improving the model's generalization in complex driving environments. In model training, advanced techniques like knowledge distillation, dynamic fine-tuning, and quantization are integrated to reduce storage and computational costs while boosting performance. Experimental results show that this systematic optimization method not only significantly improves the model's accuracy in key tasks but also achieves efficient resource utilization, providing strong support for the practical application of driving scenario perception technologies.

Abstract: With the rapid development of vision tasks and the scaling on datasets and models, redundancy reduction in vision datasets has become a key area of research. To address this issue, dataset distillation (DD) has emerged as a promising approach to generating highly compact synthetic datasets with significantly less redundancy while preserving essential information. However, while DD has been extensively studied for image datasets, DD on video datasets remains underexplored. Video datasets present unique challenges due to the presence of temporal information and varying levels of redundancy across different classes. Existing DD approaches assume a uniform level of temporal redundancy across all different video semantics, which limits their effectiveness on video datasets. In this work, we propose Dynamic-Aware Video Distillation (DAViD), a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to predict the optimal Temporal Resolution of the synthetic videos. A teacher-in-the-loop reward function is proposed to update the RL agent policy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce adaptive temporal resolution based on video semantics in video dataset distillation. Our approach significantly outperforms existing DD methods, demonstrating substantial improvements in performance. This work paves the way for future research on more efficient and semantic-adaptive video dataset distillation research.

<title>Evaluating the Efficacy of LLM-Based Reasoning for Multiobjective HPC Job Scheduling</title>

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) job scheduling involves balancing conflicting objectives such as minimizing makespan, reducing wait times, optimizing resource use, and ensuring fairness. Traditional methods, including heuristic-based (e.g., First-Come-First-Served) or intensive optimization techniques, often lack adaptability to dynamic workloads and heterogeneous HPC systems. To address this, we propose a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based scheduler using a ReAct-style framework (Reason + Act), enabling iterative, interpretable decision-making. The system incorporates a scratchpad memory to track scheduling history and refine decisions via natural language feedback, while a constraint enforcement module ensures feasibility and safety. We evaluate our approach using OpenAI's O4-Mini and Anthropic's Claude 3.7 across seven real-world HPC workload scenarios, including heterogeneous mixes, bursty patterns, and adversarial cases. Comparisons against FCFS, Shortest Job First, and Google OR-Tools (on 10 to 100 jobs) reveal that LLM-based scheduling effectively balances multiple objectives while offering transparent reasoning through natural language traces. The method excels in constraint satisfaction and adapts to diverse workloads without domain-specific training. However, a trade-off between reasoning quality and computational overhead challenges real-time deployment. This work presents the first comprehensive study of reasoning-capable LLMs for HPC scheduling, demonstrating their potential to handle multiobjective optimization while highlighting limitations in computational efficiency. The findings provide insights into leveraging advanced language models for complex scheduling problems in dynamic HPC environments.

Abstract: Many identity systems assign a single, static identifier to an individual for life, reused across domains like healthcare, finance, and education. These Universal Lifelong Identifiers (ULIs) underpin critical workflows but now pose systemic privacy risks. We take the position that ULIs are fundamentally incompatible with the AI era and must be phased out. We articulate a threat model grounded in modern AI capabilities and show that traditional safeguards such as redaction, consent, and access controls are no longer sufficient. We define core properties for identity systems in the AI era and present a cryptographic framework that satisfies them while retaining compatibility with existing identifier workflows. Our design preserves institutional workflows, supports essential functions such as auditability and delegation, and offers a practical migration path beyond ULIs.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of machine learning (ML) technologies has driven organizations across diverse sectors to seek efficient and reliable methods to accelerate model development-to-deployment. Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) has emerged as an integrative approach addressing these requirements by unifying relevant roles and streamlining ML workflows. As the MLOps market continues to grow, securing these pipelines has become increasingly critical. However, the unified nature of MLOps ecosystem introduces vulnerabilities, making them susceptible to adversarial attacks where a single misconfiguration can lead to compromised credentials, severe financial losses, damaged public trust, and the poisoning of training data. Our paper presents a systematic application of the MITRE ATLAS (Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial-Intelligence Systems) framework, a comprehensive and continuously updated catalog of AI-focused attacks, to systematically assess attacks across different phases of the MLOps ecosystem. We begin by examining the preparatory phases during which adversaries acquire the essential intelligence required to initiate their attacks. We then present a structured taxonomy of attack techniques explicitly mapped to corresponding phases of the MLOps ecosystem, supported by examples drawn from red-teaming exercises and real-world incidents. This is followed by a taxonomy of mitigation strategies aligned with these attack categories, offering actionable early-stage defenses to strengthen the security of MLOps ecosystem. Given the rapid evolution and adoption of MLOps, we further highlight key research gaps that require immediate attention. Our work emphasizes the importance of implementing robust security protocols from the outset, empowering practitioners to safeguard MLOps ecosystem against evolving cyber attacks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated through standardized benchmarks. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduces FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and structured text sources, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains such as equity analysis and macroeconomic forecasting. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information. Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub\footnote{https://github.com/PhealenWang/financial\_rag\_benchmark}.

Abstract: Personalized speech intelligibility prediction is challenging. Previous approaches have mainly relied on audiograms, which are inherently limited in accuracy as they only capture a listener's hearing threshold for pure tones. Rather than incorporating additional listener features, we propose a novel approach that leverages an individual's existing intelligibility data to predict their performance on new audio. We introduce the Support Sample-Based Intelligibility Prediction Network (SSIPNet), a deep learning model that leverages speech foundation models to build a high-dimensional representation of a listener's speech recognition ability from multiple support (audio, score) pairs, enabling accurate predictions for unseen audio. Results on the Clarity Prediction Challenge dataset show that, even with a small number of support (audio, score) pairs, our method outperforms audiogram-based predictions. Our work presents a new paradigm for personalized speech intelligibility prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning (MCIT) aims to finetune Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to continually align with human intent across sequential tasks. Existing approaches often rely on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LoRA framework to preserve previous instruction alignments. However, these methods are prone to Catastrophic Forgetting (CF), as they aggregate all LoRA blocks via simple summation, which compromises performance over time. In this paper, we identify a critical parameter inefficiency in the MoELoRA framework within the MCIT context. Based on this insight, we propose BranchLoRA, an asymmetric framework to enhance both efficiency and performance. To mitigate CF, we introduce a flexible tuning-freezing mechanism within BranchLoRA, enabling branches to specialize in intra-task knowledge while fostering inter-task collaboration. Moreover, we incrementally incorporate task-specific routers to ensure an optimal branch distribution over time, rather than favoring the most recent task. To streamline inference, we introduce a task selector that automatically routes test inputs to the appropriate router without requiring task identity. Extensive experiments on the latest MCIT benchmark demonstrate that BranchLoRA significantly outperforms MoELoRA and maintains its superiority across various MLLM sizes.

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework for addressing the challenges posed by generative artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education assessment through a machine-versus-machine approach. Large language models like GPT-4, Claude, and Llama increasingly demonstrate the ability to produce sophisticated academic content, traditional assessment methods face an existential threat, with surveys indicating 74-92% of students experimenting with these tools for academic purposes. Current responses, ranging from detection software to manual assessment redesign, show significant limitations: detection tools demonstrate bias against non-native English writers and can be easily circumvented, while manual frameworks rely heavily on subjective judgment and assume static AI capabilities. This paper introduces a dual strategy paradigm combining static analysis and dynamic testing to create a comprehensive theoretical framework for assessment vulnerability evaluation. The static analysis component comprises eight theoretically justified elements: specificity and contextualization, temporal relevance, process visibility requirements, personalization elements, resource accessibility, multimodal integration, ethical reasoning requirements, and collaborative elements. Each element addresses specific limitations in generative AI capabilities, creating barriers that distinguish authentic human learning from AI-generated simulation. The dynamic testing component provides a complementary approach through simulation-based vulnerability assessment, addressing limitations in pattern-based analysis. The paper presents a theoretical framework for vulnerability scoring, including the conceptual basis for quantitative assessment, weighting frameworks, and threshold determination theory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with the structured reasoning and tool-assisted computation needed for problem solving in cybersecurity applications. In this work, we introduce "random-crypto", a cryptographic Capture-the-Flag (CTF) challenge generator framework that we use to fine-tune a tool-augmented Llama-3.1-8B with Guided Reinforcement Prompt Optimisation (GRPO), allowing the agent to iteratively write and execute Python inside an isolated REPL. GRPO yields a +53% absolute jump in Pass@8 on unseen "random-crypto" tasks (0.35 -> 0.88) and raises Majority@8 to 0.41. The fine-tuned agent also generalizes to an external dataset. On a subset of picoCTF cryptography problems, it improves Pass@8 by +13 pp. Ablations show the gains stem from more reliable tool invocation and code synthesis, rather than superficial prompt adaptation.

Abstract: We introduce EvoGit, a decentralized multi-agent framework for collaborative software development driven by autonomous code evolution. EvoGit deploys a population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern frameworks, and (2) constructing a meta-level system that evolves its own language-model-guided solver for the bin-packing optimization problem. Our results underscore EvoGit's potential to establish a new paradigm for decentralized, automated, and continual software development. EvoGit is open-sourced at https://github.com/BillHuang2001/evogit.

Abstract: Effective agent exploration remains a core challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) for complex discrete state-space environments, particularly under partial observability. This paper presents a decoupled hierarchical RL framework integrating state abstraction (DcHRL-SA) to address this issue. The proposed method employs a dual-level architecture, consisting of a high level RL-based actor and a low-level rule-based policy, to promote effective exploration. Additionally, state abstraction method is incorporated to cluster discrete states, effectively lowering state dimensionality. Experiments conducted in two discrete customized grid environments demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms PPO in terms of exploration efficiency, convergence speed, cumulative reward, and policy stability. These results demonstrate a practical approach for integrating decoupled hierarchical policies and state abstraction in discrete grids with large-scale exploration space. Code will be available at https://github.com/XQY169/DcHRL-SA.

Abstract: The de novo generation of drug-like molecules capable of inducing desirable phenotypic changes is receiving increasing attention. However, previous methods predominantly rely on expression profiles to guide molecule generation, but overlook the perturbative effect of the molecules on cellular contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose SmilesGEN, a novel generative model based on variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to generate molecules with potential therapeutic effects. SmilesGEN integrates a pre-trained drug VAE (SmilesNet) with an expression profile VAE (ProfileNet), jointly modeling the interplay between drug perturbations and transcriptional responses in a common latent space. Specifically, ProfileNet is imposed to reconstruct pre-treatment expression profiles when eliminating drug-induced perturbations in the latent space, while SmilesNet is informed by desired expression profiles to generate drug-like molecules. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that SmilesGEN outperforms current state-of-the-art models in generating molecules with higher degree of validity, uniqueness, novelty, as well as higher Tanimoto similarity to known ligands targeting the relevant proteins. Moreover, we evaluate SmilesGEN for scaffold-based molecule optimization and generation of therapeutic agents, and confirmed its superior performance in generating molecules with higher similarity to approved drugs. SmilesGEN establishes a robust framework that leverages gene signatures to generate drug-like molecules that hold promising potential to induce desirable cellular phenotypic changes.

Abstract: Recently, extensive deep learning architectures and pretraining strategies have been explored to support downstream protein applications. Additionally, domain-specific models incorporating biological knowledge have been developed to enhance performance in specialized tasks. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Protap}$, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically compares backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and domain-specific models across diverse and realistic downstream protein applications. Specifically, Protap covers five applications: three general tasks and two novel specialized tasks, i.e., enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage site prediction and targeted protein degradation, which are industrially relevant yet missing from existing benchmarks. For each application, Protap compares various domain-specific models and general architectures under multiple pretraining settings. Our empirical studies imply that: (i) Though large-scale pretraining encoders achieve great results, they often underperform supervised encoders trained on small downstream training sets. (ii) Incorporating structural information during downstream fine-tuning can match or even outperform protein language models pretrained on large-scale sequence corpora. (iii) Domain-specific biological priors can enhance performance on specialized downstream tasks. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Trust-App-AI-Lab/protap.

Abstract: Ensemble clustering has demonstrated great success in practice; however, its theoretical foundations remain underexplored. This paper examines the generalization performance of ensemble clustering, focusing on generalization error, excess risk and consistency. We derive a convergence rate of generalization error bound and excess risk bound both of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log n}{m}}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, with $n$ and $m$ being the numbers of samples and base clusterings. Based on this, we prove that when $m$ and $n$ approach infinity and $m$ is significantly larger than log $n$, i.e., $m,n\to \infty, m\gg \log n$, ensemble clustering is consistent. Furthermore, recognizing that $n$ and $m$ are finite in practice, the generalization error cannot be reduced to zero. Thus, by assigning varying weights to finite clusterings, we minimize the error between the empirical average clusterings and their expectation. From this, we theoretically demonstrate that to achieve better clustering performance, we should minimize the deviation (bias) of base clustering from its expectation and maximize the differences (diversity) among various base clusterings. Additionally, we derive that maximizing diversity is nearly equivalent to a robust (min-max) optimization model. Finally, we instantiate our theory to develop a new ensemble clustering algorithm. Compared with SOTA methods, our approach achieves average improvements of 6.1%, 7.3%, and 6.0% on 10 datasets w.r.t. NMI, ARI, and Purity. The code is available at https://github.com/xuz2019/GPEC.

Abstract: Autonomous multi-agent AI systems are poised to transform various industries, particularly software development and knowledge work. Understanding current perceptions among professionals is crucial for anticipating adoption challenges, ethical considerations, and future workforce development. This study analyzes responses from 130 participants to a survey on the capabilities, impact, and governance of AI agents. We explore expected timelines for AI replacing programmers, identify perceived barriers to deployment, and examine beliefs about responsibility when agents make critical decisions. Key findings reveal three distinct clusters of respondents. While the study explored factors associated with current AI agent deployment, the initial logistic regression model did not yield statistically significant predictors, suggesting that deployment decisions are complex and may be influenced by factors not fully captured or that a larger sample is needed. These insights highlight the need for organizations to address compliance concerns (a commonly cited barrier) and establish clear governance frameworks as they integrate autonomous agents into their workflows.

Abstract: Enabling robots to accurately interpret and execute spoken language instructions is essential for effective human-robot collaboration. Traditional methods rely on speech recognition to transcribe speech into text, often discarding crucial prosodic cues needed for disambiguating intent. We propose a novel approach that directly leverages speech prosody to infer and resolve instruction intent. Predicted intents are integrated into large language models via in-context learning to disambiguate and select appropriate task plans. Additionally, we present the first ambiguous speech dataset for robotics, designed to advance research in speech disambiguation. Our method achieves 95.79% accuracy in detecting referent intents within an utterance and determines the intended task plan of ambiguous instructions with 71.96% accuracy, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve human-robot communication.

Abstract: Introduction: Personal identification is a critical aspect of forensic sciences, security, and healthcare. While conventional biometrics systems such as DNA profiling and iris scanning offer high accuracy, they are time-consuming and costly. Objectives: This study investigates the relationship between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood group classification to explore potential correlations between these two traits. Methods: The study analyzed 200 individuals, categorizing their fingerprints into three types: loops, whorls, and arches. Blood group classification was also recorded. Statistical analysis, including chi-square and Pearson correlation tests, was used to assess associations between fingerprint patterns and blood groups. Results: Loops were the most common fingerprint pattern, while blood group O+ was the most prevalent among the participants. Statistical analysis revealed no significant correlation between fingerprint patterns and blood groups (p > 0.05), suggesting that these traits are independent. Conclusions: Although the study showed limited correlation between fingerprint patterns and ABO blood groups, it highlights the importance of future research using larger and more diverse populations, incorporating machine learning approaches, and integrating multiple biometric signals. This study contributes to forensic science by emphasizing the need for rigorous protocols and comprehensive investigations in personal identification.

Abstract: The ability to learn and retain a wide variety of tasks is a hallmark of human intelligence that has inspired research in artificial general intelligence. Continual learning approaches provide a significant step towards achieving this goal. It has been known that task variability and context switching are challenging for learning in neural networks. Catastrophic forgetting refers to the poor performance on retention of a previously learned task when a new task is being learned. Switching between different task contexts can be a useful approach to mitigate the same by preventing the interference between the varying task weights of the network. This paper introduces Elastic Weight Generative Networks (EWGN) as an idea for context switching between two different tasks. The proposed EWGN architecture uses an additional network that generates the weights of the primary network dynamically while consolidating the weights learned. The weight generation is input-dependent and thus enables context switching. Using standard computer vision datasets, namely MNIST and fashion-MNIST, we analyse the retention of previously learned task representations in Fully Connected Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and EWGN architectures with Stochastic Gradient Descent and Elastic Weight Consolidation learning algorithms. Understanding dynamic weight generation and context-switching ability can be useful in enabling continual learning for improved performance.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has transformed numerous industries, from healthcare to finance, enhancing decision-making through automated systems. However, the reliability of these systems is mainly dependent on the quality of the underlying datasets, raising ongoing concerns about transparency, accountability, and potential biases. This paper introduces a scorecard designed to evaluate the development of AI datasets, focusing on five key areas from the system card framework data development life cycle: data dictionary, collection process, composition, motivation, and pre-processing. The method follows a structured approach, using an intake form and scoring criteria to assess the quality and completeness of the data set. Applied to four diverse datasets, the methodology reveals strengths and improvement areas. The results are compiled using a scoring system that provides tailored recommendations to enhance the transparency and integrity of the data set. The scorecard addresses technical and ethical aspects, offering a holistic evaluation of data practices. This approach aims to improve the quality of the data set. It offers practical guidance to curators and researchers in developing responsible AI systems, ensuring fairness and accountability in decision support systems.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code generation, existing benchmarks neglect the flowchart-based code generation. To promote further research on flowchart-based code generation, this work presents Flow2Code, a novel benchmark for flowchart-based code generation evaluation. The evaluation dataset spans 15 programming languages and includes 5,622 code segments paired with 16,866 flowcharts of three types: code, UML, and pseudocode. Extensive experiments with 13 multimodal LLMs reveal that current LLMs can not generate code based on flowcharts perfectly. Besides, experiment results show that the supervised fine-tuning technique contributes greatly to the models' performance. We publicly release our code and datasets at https://github.com/hml-github/Flow2Code.

<title>Assigning Distinct Roles to Quantized and Low-Rank Matrices Toward Optimal Weight Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Decomposing weight matrices into quantization and low-rank components ($\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$) is a widely used technique for compressing large language models (LLMs). Existing joint optimization methods iteratively alternate between quantization and low-rank approximation. However, these methods tend to prioritize one component at the expense of the other, resulting in suboptimal decompositions that fail to leverage each component's unique strengths. In this work, we introduce Outlier-Driven Low-Rank Initialization (ODLRI), which assigns low-rank components the specific role of capturing activation-sensitive weights. This structured decomposition mitigates outliers' negative impact on quantization, enabling more effective balance between quantization and low-rank approximation. Experiments on Llama2 (7B, 13B, 70B), Llama3-8B, and Mistral-7B demonstrate that incorporating ODLRI into the joint optimization framework consistently reduces activation-aware error, minimizes quantization scale, and improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy in low-bit settings.

Abstract: Speech impairments are prevalent biomarkers for Parkinson's Disease (PD), motivating the development of diagnostic techniques using speech data for clinical applications. Although deep acoustic features have shown promise for PD classification, their effectiveness often varies due to individual speaker differences, a factor that has not been thoroughly explored in the existing literature. This study investigates the effectiveness of three pre-trained audio embeddings (OpenL3, VGGish and Wav2Vec2.0 models) for PD classification. Using the NeuroVoz dataset, OpenL3 outperforms others in diadochokinesis (DDK) and listen and repeat (LR) tasks, capturing critical acoustic features for PD detection. Only Wav2Vec2.0 shows significant gender bias, achieving more favorable results for male speakers, in DDK tasks. The misclassified cases reveal challenges with atypical speech patterns, highlighting the need for improved feature extraction and model robustness in PD detection.

<title>Robust Federated Learning against Noisy Clients via Masked Optimization</title>

Abstract: In recent years, federated learning (FL) has made significant advance in privacy-sensitive applications. However, it can be hard to ensure that FL participants provide well-annotated data for training. The corresponding annotations from different clients often contain complex label noise at varying levels. This label noise issue has a substantial impact on the performance of the trained models, and clients with greater noise levels can be largely attributed for this degradation. To this end, it is necessary to develop an effective optimization strategy to alleviate the adverse effects of these noisy clients.In this study, we present a two-stage optimization framework, MaskedOptim, to address this intricate label noise problem. The first stage is designed to facilitate the detection of noisy clients with higher label noise rates. The second stage focuses on rectifying the labels of the noisy clients' data through an end-to-end label correction mechanism, aiming to mitigate the negative impacts caused by misinformation within datasets. This is achieved by learning the potential ground-truth labels of the noisy clients' datasets via backpropagation. To further enhance the training robustness, we apply the geometric median based model aggregation instead of the commonly-used vanilla averaged model aggregation. We implement sixteen related methods and conduct evaluations on three image datasets and one text dataset with diverse label noise patterns for a comprehensive comparison. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed framework shows its robustness in different scenarios. Additionally, our label correction framework effectively enhances the data quality of the detected noisy clients' local datasets. % Our codes will be open-sourced to facilitate related research communities. Our codes are available via https://github.com/Sprinter1999/MaskedOptim .

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) systems employ automatic measures of pronunciation quality, such as the goodness of pronunciation (GOP) metric. GOP relies on forced alignments, which are prone to labeling and segmentation errors due to acoustic variability. While alignment-free methods address these challenges, they are computationally expensive and scale poorly with phoneme sequence length and inventory size. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a substitution-aware alignment-free GOP that restricts phoneme substitutions based on phoneme clusters and common learner errors. We evaluated our GOP on two L2 English speech datasets, one with child speech, My Pronunciation Coach (MPC), and SpeechOcean762, which includes child and adult speech. We compared RPS (restricted phoneme substitutions) and UPS (unrestricted phoneme substitutions) setups within alignment-free methods, which outperformed the baseline. We discuss our results and outline avenues for future research.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing, recent research has explored the building of time series foundation models and applied them to tasks such as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. However, their performances vary between different domains and tasks. In LLM-based approaches, test-time adaptation using example-based prompting has become common, owing to the high cost of retraining. In the context of anomaly detection, which is the focus of this study, providing normal examples from the target domain can also be effective. However, time series foundation models do not naturally acquire the ability to interpret or utilize examples or instructions, because the nature of time series data used during training does not encourage such capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a retrieval augmented time series foundation model (RATFM), which enables pretrained time series foundation models to incorporate examples of test-time adaptation. We show that RATFM achieves a performance comparable to that of in-domain fine-tuning while avoiding domain-dependent fine-tuning. Experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive, a multi-domain dataset including nine domains, confirms the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Speech quality assessment is a critical process in selecting text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) or voice conversion models. Evaluation of voice synthesis can be done using objective metrics or subjective metrics. Although there are many objective metrics like the Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), Perceptual Objective Listening Quality Assessment (POLQA) or Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) but none of them is feasible in selecting the best model. On the other hand subjective metric like Mean Opinion Score is highly reliable but it requires a lot of manual efforts and are time-consuming. To counter the issues in MOS Evaluation, we have developed a novel model, Speaker Agnostic Latent Features (SALF)-Mean Opinion Score (MOS) which is a small-sized, end-to-end, highly generalized and scalable model for predicting MOS score on a scale of 5. We use the sequences of convolutions and stack them to get the latent features of the audio samples to get the best state-of-the-art results based on mean squared error (MSE), Linear Concordance Correlation coefficient (LCC), Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) and Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient (KTAU).

Abstract: Speaker recognition models face challenges in multi-lingual settings due to the entanglement of linguistic information within speaker embeddings. The overlap between vocal traits such as accent, vocal anatomy, and a language's phonetic structure complicates separating linguistic and speaker information. Disentangling these components can significantly improve speaker recognition accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel disentanglement learning strategy that integrates joint learning through prefix-tuned cross-attention. This approach is particularly effective when speakers switch between languages. Experimental results show the model generalizes across monolingual and multi-lingual settings, including unseen languages. Notably, the proposed model improves the equal error rate across multiple datasets, highlighting its ability to separate language information from speaker embeddings and enhance recognition in diverse linguistic conditions.

Abstract: Audio deepfakes are acquiring an unprecedented level of realism with advanced AI. While current research focuses on discerning real speech from spoofed speech, tracing the source system is equally crucial. This work proposes a novel audio source tracing system combining deep metric multi-class N-pair loss with Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion framework, a Conformer classification network, and ensemble score-embedding fusion. The N-pair loss improves discriminative ability, while Real Emphasis and Fake Dispersion enhance robustness by focusing on differentiating real and fake speech patterns. The Conformer network captures both global and local dependencies in the audio signal, crucial for source tracing. The proposed ensemble score-embedding fusion shows an optimal trade-off between in-domain and out-of-domain source tracing scenarios. We evaluate our method using Frechet Distance and standard metrics, demonstrating superior performance in source tracing over the baseline system.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer transformative capabilities for hardware design automation, particularly in Verilog code generation. However, they also pose significant data security challenges, including Verilog evaluation data contamination, intellectual property (IP) design leakage, and the risk of malicious Verilog generation. We introduce SALAD, a comprehensive assessment that leverages machine unlearning to mitigate these threats. Our approach enables the selective removal of contaminated benchmarks, sensitive IP and design artifacts, or malicious code patterns from pre-trained LLMs, all without requiring full retraining. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate how machine unlearning techniques effectively reduce data security risks in LLM-aided hardware design.

Abstract: To increase the trustworthiness of deep neural networks, it is critical to improve the understanding of how they make decisions. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised concept-based model for image classification, named Learnable Concept-Based Model (LCBM) which models concepts as random variables within a Bernoulli latent space. Unlike traditional methods that either require extensive human supervision or suffer from limited scalability, our approach employs a reduced number of concepts without sacrificing performance. We demonstrate that LCBM surpasses existing unsupervised concept-based models in generalization capability and nearly matches the performance of black-box models. The proposed concept representation enhances information retention and aligns more closely with human understanding. A user study demonstrates the discovered concepts are also more intuitive for humans to interpret. Finally, despite the use of concept embeddings, we maintain model interpretability by means of a local linear combination of concepts.

Abstract: A random-key genetic algorithm is an evolutionary metaheuristic for discrete and global optimization. Each solution is encoded as a vector of N random keys, where a random key is a real number randomly generated in the continuous interval [0, 1). A decoder maps each vector of random keys to a solution of the optimization problem being solved and computes its cost. The benefit of this approach is that all genetic operators and transformations can be maintained within the unitary hypercube, regardless of the problem being addressed. This enhances the productivity and maintainability of the core framework. The algorithm starts with a population of P vectors of random keys. At each iteration, the vectors are partitioned into two sets: a smaller set of high-valued elite solutions and the remaining non-elite solutions. All elite elements are copied, without change, to the next population. A small number of random-key vectors (the mutants) is added to the population of the next iteration. The remaining elements of the population of the next iteration are generated by combining, with the parametrized uniform crossover of Spears and DeJong (1991), pairs of solutions. This chapter reviews random-key genetic algorithms and describes an effective variant called biased random-key genetic algorithms.

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is an essential task in computer-assisted interventions. This problem is particularly relevant to oncological treatments, where precise image alignment is necessary for tracking tumor growth, assessing treatment response, and ensuring accurate delivery of therapies. Recent AI methods can outperform traditional techniques in accuracy and speed, yet they often produce unreliable deformations that limit their clinical adoption. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce a novel implicit registration framework that can predict accurate and reliable deformations. Our insight is to reformulate image registration as a signal reconstruction problem: we learn a kernel function that can recover the dense displacement field from sparse keypoint correspondences. We integrate our method in a novel hierarchical architecture, and estimate the displacement field in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our formulation also allows for efficient refinement at test time, permitting clinicians to easily adjust registrations when needed. We validate our method on challenging intra-patient thoracic and abdominal zero-shot registration tasks, using public and internal datasets from the local University Hospital. Our method not only shows competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches, but also bridges the generalization gap between implicit and explicit registration techniques. In particular, our method generates deformations that better preserve anatomical relationships and matches the performance of specialized commercial systems, underscoring its potential for clinical adoption.

Abstract: Outliers introduce significant training challenges in neural networks by propagating erroneous gradients, which can degrade model performance and generalization. We propose the Z-Error Loss, a statistically principled approach that minimizes outlier influence during training by masking the contribution of data points identified as out-of-distribution within each batch. This method leverages batch-level statistics to automatically detect and exclude anomalous samples, allowing the model to focus its learning on the true underlying data structure. Our approach is robust, adaptive to data quality, and provides valuable diagnostics for data curation and cleaning.

Abstract: Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) has been extensively studied for English. However, there remains a critical gap in its application to Indian languages with a base of 1.5 billion speakers. Pronunciation tools tailored to Indian languages are strikingly lacking despite the fact that millions learn them every year. With over 600 million speakers and being the fourth most-spoken language worldwide, improving Hindi pronunciation is a vital first step toward addressing this gap. This paper proposes 1) Dhvani -- a novel CAPT system for Hindi, 2) synthetic speech generation for Hindi mispronunciations, and 3) a novel methodology for providing personalized feedback to learners. While the system often interacts with learners using Devanagari graphemes, its core analysis targets phonemic distinctions, leveraging Hindi's highly phonetic orthography to analyze mispronounced speech and provide targeted feedback.

Abstract: Modern AI systems struggle most in environments where reliability is critical - scenes with smoke, poor visibility, and structural deformation. Each year, tens of thousands of firefighters are injured on duty, often due to breakdowns in situational perception. We introduce Fire360, a benchmark for evaluating perception and reasoning in safety-critical firefighting scenarios. The dataset includes 228 360-degree videos from professional training sessions under diverse conditions (e.g., low light, thermal distortion), annotated with action segments, object locations, and degradation metadata. Fire360 supports five tasks: Visual Question Answering, Temporal Action Captioning, Object Localization, Safety-Critical Reasoning, and Transformed Object Retrieval (TOR). TOR tests whether models can match pristine exemplars to fire-damaged counterparts in unpaired scenes, evaluating transformation-invariant recognition. While human experts achieve 83.5% on TOR, models like GPT-4o lag significantly, exposing failures in reasoning under degradation. By releasing Fire360 and its evaluation suite, we aim to advance models that not only see, but also remember, reason, and act under uncertainty. The dataset is available at: https://uofi.box.com/v/fire360dataset.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in ASR, the specific acoustic cues models rely on remain unclear. Prior studies have examined such cues on a limited set of phonemes and outdated models. In this work, we apply a feature attribution technique to identify the relevant acoustic cues for a modern Conformer-based ASR system. By analyzing plosives, fricatives, and vowels, we assess how feature attributions align with their acoustic properties in the time and frequency domains, also essential for human speech perception. Our findings show that the ASR model relies on vowels' full time spans, particularly their first two formants, with greater saliency in male speech. It also better captures the spectral characteristics of sibilant fricatives than non-sibilants and prioritizes the release phase in plosives, especially burst characteristics. These insights enhance the interpretability of ASR models and highlight areas for future research to uncover potential gaps in model robustness.

Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances offer an efficient method for comparing high-dimensional probability measures by projecting them onto multiple 1-dimensional probability distributions. However, identifying informative slicing directions has proven challenging, often necessitating a large number of slices to achieve desirable performance and thereby increasing computational complexity. We introduce a constrained learning approach to optimize the slicing directions for SW distances. Specifically, we constrain the 1D transport plans to approximate the optimal plan in the original space, ensuring meaningful slicing directions. By leveraging continuous relaxations of these transport plans, we enable a gradient-based primal-dual approach to train the slicer parameters, alongside the remaining model parameters. We demonstrate how this constrained slicing approach can be applied to pool high-dimensional embeddings into fixed-length permutation-invariant representations. Numerical results on foundation models trained on images, point clouds, and protein sequences showcase the efficacy of the proposed constrained learning approach in learning more informative slicing directions.

Abstract: The Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) is a widely adopted trajectory optimizer in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL), but its unimodal sampling strategy often leads to premature convergence in multimodal landscapes. In this work, we propose Bregman Centroid Guided CEM ($\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM), a lightweight enhancement to ensemble CEM that leverages $\textit{Bregman centroids}$ for principled information aggregation and diversity control. $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ computes a performance-weighted Bregman centroid across CEM workers and updates the least contributing ones by sampling within a trust region around the centroid. Leveraging the duality between Bregman divergences and exponential family distributions, we show that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ integrates seamlessly into standard CEM pipelines with negligible overhead. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, a cluttered navigation task, and full MBRL pipelines demonstrate that $\textbf{$\mathcal{BC}$-EvoCEM}$ enhances both convergence and solution quality, providing a simple yet effective upgrade for CEM.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) post-training have leveraged two distinct paradigms to enhance reasoning capabilities: reinforcement learning (RL) and knowledge distillation (KD). While RL enables the emergence of complex reasoning behaviors, it often suffers from low sample efficiency when the initial policy struggles to explore high-reward trajectories. Conversely, KD improves learning efficiency via mimicking the teacher model but tends to generalize poorly to out-of-domain scenarios. In this work, we present \textbf{KDRL}, a \textit{unified post-training framework} that jointly optimizes a reasoning model through teacher supervision (KD) and self-exploration (RL). Specifically, KDRL leverages policy gradient optimization to simultaneously minimize the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL) between the student and teacher distributions while maximizing the expected rule-based rewards. We first formulate a unified objective that integrates GRPO and KD, and systematically explore how different KL approximations, KL coefficients, and reward-guided KD strategies affect the overall post-training dynamics and performance. Empirical results on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that KDRL outperforms GRPO and various KD baselines while achieving a favorable balance between performance and reasoning token efficiency. These findings indicate that integrating KD and RL serves as an effective and efficient strategy to train reasoning LLMs.

Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) are equipped with increasingly many parameters and require more and more resource for deployment. Researchers have explored various ways to improve the efficiency of NNs by identifying and reducing the redundancy, such as pruning or quantizing unimportant weights. Symmetry in the NN architectures has been identified by prior work as a possible type of redundancy, but exploiting it for efficient inference is not yet explored. In this work, we formalize the symmetry of parameters and intermediate values in NNs using the statistical property of exchangeablility. We identify that exchangeable values in NN computation may contain overlapping information, leading to redundancy. Exploiting the insight, we derive a principled general dynamic pruning algorithm ExPrune to remove symmetry-induced redundancy on a per-input basis. We also provide an instantiation of ExPrune that performs neuron-level dynamic pruning by predicting negative inputs to ReLU activations. We evaluate ExPrune on two computer vision models, one graph model and one language model. ExPrune provides 10.98--26.3% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 21.01--39.05% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop. We also demonstrate that ExPrune composes with static pruning. On models that have been aggressively pruned statically, ExPrune provides additional 10.24--11.11% reduction in FLOPs with negligible accuracy drop and 13.91--14.39% reduction in FLOPs with at most 1% accuracy drop.

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) has transformed various fields beyond linguistics by applying techniques originally developed for human language to the analysis of biological sequences. This review explores the application of NLP methods to biological sequence data, focusing on genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. We examine how various NLP methods, from classic approaches like word2vec to advanced models employing transformers and hyena operators, are being adapted to analyze DNA, RNA, protein sequences, and entire genomes. The review also examines tokenization strategies and model architectures, evaluating their strengths, limitations, and suitability for different biological tasks. We further cover recent advances in NLP applications for biological data, such as structure prediction, gene expression, and evolutionary analysis, highlighting the potential of these methods for extracting meaningful insights from large-scale genomic data. As language models continue to advance, their integration into bioinformatics holds immense promise for advancing our understanding of biological processes in all domains of life.

Abstract: Pathological examination of the placenta is an effective method for detecting and mitigating health risks associated with childbirth. Recent advancements in AI have enabled the use of photographs of the placenta and pathology reports for detecting and classifying signs of childbirth-related pathologies. However, existing automated methods are computationally extensive, which limits their deployability. We propose two modifications to vision-language contrastive learning (VLC) frameworks to enhance their accuracy and efficiency: (1) text-anchored vision-language contrastive knowledge distillation (VLCD)-a new knowledge distillation strategy for medical VLC pretraining, and (2) unsupervised predistillation using a large natural images dataset for improved initialization. Our approach distills efficient neural networks that match or surpass the teacher model in performance while achieving model compression and acceleration. Our results showcase the value of unsupervised predistillation in improving the performance and robustness of our approach, specifically for lower-quality images. VLCD serves as an effective way to improve the efficiency and deployability of medical VLC approaches, making AI-based healthcare solutions more accessible, especially in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have yielded unprecedented quality in visual content and semantic coherence. However, current approaches predominantly rely on statistical learning from vast datasets without explicitly modeling the underlying physics of motion, resulting in subtle yet perceptible non-physical artifacts that diminish the realism of generated videos. This paper introduces a physics-informed frequency domain approach to enhance the physical plausibility of generated videos. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the frequency-domain characteristics of diverse physical motions (translation, rotation, scaling), revealing that each motion type exhibits distinctive and identifiable spectral signatures. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose two complementary components: (1) a physical motion loss function that quantifies and optimizes the conformity of generated videos to ideal frequency-domain motion patterns, and (2) a frequency domain enhancement module that progressively learns to adjust video features to conform to physical motion constraints while preserving original network functionality through a zero-initialization strategy. Experiments across multiple video diffusion architectures demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances motion quality and physical plausibility without compromising visual quality or semantic alignment. Our frequency-domain physical motion framework generalizes effectively across different video generation architectures, offering a principled approach to incorporating physical constraints into deep learning-based video synthesis pipelines. This work seeks to establish connections between data-driven models and physics-based motion models.

Abstract: Stress affects physical and mental health, and wearable devices have been widely used to detect daily stress through physiological signals. However, these signals vary due to factors such as individual differences and health conditions, making generalizing machine learning models difficult. To address these challenges, we present Human Heterogeneity Invariant Stress Sensing (HHISS), a domain generalization approach designed to find consistent patterns in stress signals by removing person-specific differences. This helps the model perform more accurately across new people, environments, and stress types not seen during training. Its novelty lies in proposing a novel technique called person-wise sub-network pruning intersection to focus on shared features across individuals, alongside preventing overfitting by leveraging continuous labels while training. The study focuses especially on people with opioid use disorder (OUD)-a group where stress responses can change dramatically depending on their time of daily medication taking. Since stress often triggers cravings, a model that can adapt well to these changes could support better OUD rehabilitation and recovery. We tested HHISS on seven different stress datasets-four of which we collected ourselves and three public ones. Four are from lab setups, one from a controlled real-world setting, driving, and two are from real-world in-the-wild field datasets without any constraints. This is the first study to evaluate how well a stress detection model works across such a wide range of data. Results show HHISS consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baseline methods, proving both effective and practical for real-world use. Ablation studies, empirical justifications, and runtime evaluations confirm HHISS's feasibility and scalability for mobile stress sensing in sensitive real-world applications.

Abstract: Eliciting reliable human feedback is essential for many machine learning tasks, such as learning from noisy labels and aligning AI systems with human preferences. Peer prediction mechanisms incentivize truthful reporting without ground truth verification by scoring agents based on correlations with peers. Traditional mechanisms, which ensure that truth-telling maximizes the expected scores in equilibrium, can elicit honest information while assuming agents' utilities are linear functions of their scores. However, in practice, non-linear payment rules are usually preferred, or agents' utilities are inherently non-linear.
  We propose stochastically dominant truthfulness (SD-truthfulness) as a stronger guarantee: the score distribution of truth-telling stochastically dominates all other strategies, incentivizing truthful reporting for a wide range of monotone utility functions. Our first observation is that no existing peer prediction mechanism naturally satisfies this criterion without strong assumptions. A simple solution -- rounding scores into binary lotteries -- can enforce SD-truthfulness, but often degrades sensitivity, a key property related to fairness and statistical efficiency. We demonstrate how a more careful application of rounding can better preserve sensitivity. Furthermore, we introduce a new enforced agreement (EA) mechanism that is theoretically guaranteed to be SD-truthful in binary-signal settings under mild assumptions, and empirically achieves the highest sensitivity among all known SD-truthful mechanisms.

Abstract: While the increased integration of AI technologies into interactive systems enables them to solve an equally increasing number of tasks, the black box problem of AI models continues to spread throughout the interactive system as a whole. Explainable AI (XAI) techniques can make AI models more accessible by employing post-hoc methods or transitioning to inherently interpretable models. While this makes individual AI models clearer, the overarching system architecture remains opaque. To this end, we propose an approach to represent interactive systems as sequences of structural building blocks, such as AI models and control mechanisms grounded in the literature. These can then be explained through accompanying visual building blocks, such as XAI techniques. The flow and APIs of the structural building blocks form an explicit overview of the system. This serves as a communication basis for both humans and automated agents like LLMs, aligning human and machine interpretability of AI models. We discuss a selection of building blocks and concretize our flow-based approach in an architecture and accompanying prototype interactive system.

Abstract: Modeling user action sequences has become a popular focus in industrial recommendation system research, particularly for Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction tasks. However, industry-scale CTR models often rely on short user sequences, limiting their ability to capture long-term behavior. Additionally, these models typically lack an integrated action-prediction task within a point-wise ranking framework, reducing their predictive power. They also rarely address the infrastructure challenges involved in efficiently serving large-scale sequential models. In this paper, we introduce TransAct V2, a production model for Pinterest's Homefeed ranking system, featuring three key innovations: (1) leveraging very long user sequences to improve CTR predictions, (2) integrating a Next Action Loss function for enhanced user action forecasting, and (3) employing scalable, low-latency deployment solutions tailored to handle the computational demands of extended user action sequences.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective for tasks with known underlying symmetries. However, optimizing equivariant networks can be tricky and best training practices are less established than for standard networks. In particular, recent works have found small training benefits from relaxing equivariance constraints. This raises the question: do equivariance constraints introduce fundamental obstacles to optimization? Or do they simply require different hyperparameter tuning? In this work, we investigate this question through a theoretical analysis of the loss landscape geometry. We focus on networks built using permutation representations, which we can view as a subset of unconstrained MLPs. Importantly, we show that the parameter symmetries of the unconstrained model has nontrivial effects on the loss landscape of the equivariant subspace and under certain conditions can provably prevent learning of the global minima. Further, we empirically demonstrate in such cases, relaxing to an unconstrained MLP can sometimes solve the issue. Interestingly, the weights eventually found via relaxation corresponds to a different choice of group representation in the hidden layer. From this, we draw 3 key takeaways. (1) Viewing any class of networks in the context of larger unconstrained function space can give important insights on loss landscape structure. (2) Within the unconstrained function space, equivariant networks form a complicated union of linear hyperplanes, each associated with a specific choice of internal group representation. (3) Effective relaxation of equivariance may require not only adding nonequivariant degrees of freedom, but also rethinking the fixed choice of group representations in hidden layers.

Abstract: Current Reinforcement Fine-tuning (RFT) paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from sample inefficiency due to the redundant exposure of identical queries under uniform data sampling. While previous work has explored curriculum learning via heuristic difficulty metrics, these strategies exhibit limitations by neglecting the intrinsic learning signals generated by the model itself, thus leading to suboptimal training regimes. In this paper, we identify a model-inherent signal termed angle concentration that effectively reflects an LLM's capacity to learn from specific data. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate a correlation between the angular distribution of token hidden state vectors and the resulting gradient, revealing a learning preference for data exhibiting higher angle concentration. Inspired by this finding, we propose GAIN-RL, a Gradient-driven Angle-Informed Navigated RL framework. By leveraging the model's intrinsic angle concentration signal, GAIN-RL dynamically selects training data in each epoch, ensuring consistently impactful gradient updates and thus significantly enhancing overall training efficiency. Empirical evaluations show that GAIN-RL (GRPO) achieves over a 2.5x acceleration in training efficiency across diverse mathematical and coding tasks and varying model scales. Furthermore, GAIN-RL (GRPO)'s efficient sampling yields data-efficient training, achieving better performance with half the original data compared to vanilla GRPO with full training data.

Abstract: During long-duration Large Language Model (LLM) training runs the gradient norm increases rapidly near the end of training. In this short note, we show that this increase is due to an unintended interaction between weight decay, normalization layers, and the learning rate schedule. We propose a simple correction that fixes this behavior while also resulting in lower loss values throughout training.

Abstract: The inherent complexities of Arabic script; its cursive nature, diacritical marks (tashkeel), and varied typography, pose persistent challenges for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). We present Qari-OCR, a series of vision-language models derived from Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct, progressively optimized for Arabic through iterative fine-tuning on specialized synthetic datasets. Our leading model, QARI v0.2, establishes a new open-source state-of-the-art with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.160, Character Error Rate (CER) of 0.061, and BLEU score of 0.737 on diacritically-rich texts. Qari-OCR demonstrates superior handling of tashkeel, diverse fonts, and document layouts, alongside impressive performance on low-resolution images. Further explorations (QARI v0.3) showcase strong potential for structural document understanding and handwritten text. This work delivers a marked improvement in Arabic OCR accuracy and efficiency, with all models and datasets released to foster further research.

Abstract: Large Action Models (LAMs) for AI Agents offer incredible potential but face challenges due to the need for high-quality training data, especially for multi-steps tasks that involve planning, executing tool calls, and responding to feedback. To address these issues, we present LAM SIMULATOR, a comprehensive framework designed for online exploration of agentic tasks with high-quality feedback. Our framework features a dynamic task query generator, an extensive collection of tools, and an interactive environment where Large Language Model (LLM) Agents can call tools and receive real-time feedback. This setup enables LLM Agents to explore and solve tasks autonomously, facilitating the discovery of multiple approaches to tackle any given task. The resulting action trajectory data are then used to create high-quality training datasets for LAMs. Our experiments on popular agentic benchmarks, ToolBench and CRMArena, highlight the effectiveness of LAM SIMULATOR: models trained with self-generated datasets using our framework achieve significant performance gains, up to a 49.3\% improvement over their original baselines. LAM SIMULATOR requires minimal human input during dataset creation, highlighting LAM SIMULATOR's efficiency and effectiveness in speeding up development of AI agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can explain grammatical rules, yet they often fail to apply those rules when judging sentence acceptability. We present "grammar prompting", an explain-then-process paradigm: a large LLM first produces a concise explanation of the relevant syntactic phenomenon, then that explanation is fed back as additional context to the target model -- either an LLM or a smaller language model (SLM) -- before deciding which sentence of a minimal pair is grammatical. On the English BLiMP, Chinese SLING, and Russian RuBLiMP benchmarks, this simple prompt design yields substantial improvements over strong baselines across many syntactic phenomena. Feeding an LLM's metalinguistic explanation back to the target model bridges the gap between knowing a rule and using it. On SLMs, grammar prompting alone trims the average LLM-SLM accuracy gap by about 20%, and when paired with chain-of-thought, by 56% (13.0 pp -> 5.8 pp), all at negligible cost. The lightweight, language-agnostic cue lets low-cost SLMs approach frontier-LLM performance in multilingual settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal foundation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a range of tasks. These breakthroughs are largely driven by new pre-training paradigms that leverage large-scale, unlabeled multimodal data, followed by instruction fine-tuning on curated labeled datasets and high-quality prompts. While there is growing interest in scaling instruction fine-tuning to ever-larger datasets in both quantity and scale, our findings reveal that simply increasing the number of instruction-tuning tasks does not consistently yield better performance. Instead, we observe that grouping tasks by the common interactions across modalities, such as discovering redundant shared information, prioritizing modality selection with unique information, or requiring synergistic fusion to discover new information from both modalities, encourages the models to learn transferrable skills within a group while suppressing interference from mismatched tasks. To this end, we introduce MINT, a simple yet surprisingly effective task-grouping strategy based on the type of multimodal interaction. We demonstrate that the proposed method greatly outperforms existing task grouping baselines for multimodal instruction tuning, striking an effective balance between generalization and specialization.

<title>A Data-Based Architecture for Flight Test without Test Points</title>

Abstract: The justification for the "test point" derives from the test pilot's obligation to reproduce faithfully the pre-specified conditions of some model prediction. Pilot deviation from those conditions invalidates the model assumptions. Flight test aids have been proposed to increase accuracy on more challenging test points. However, the very existence of databands and tolerances is the problem more fundamental than inadequate pilot skill. We propose a novel approach, which eliminates test points. We start with a high-fidelity digital model of an air vehicle. Instead of using this model to generate a point prediction, we use a machine learning method to produce a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM has two important properties. First, it can generate a prediction based on any set of conditions the pilot flies. Second, if the test result at those conditions differ from the prediction, the ROM can be updated using the new data. The outcome of flight test is thus a refined ROM at whatever conditions were flown. This ROM in turn updates and validates the high-fidelity model. We present a single example of this "point-less" architecture, using T-38C flight test data. We first use a generic aircraft model to build a ROM of longitudinal pitching motion as a hypersurface. We then ingest unconstrained flight test data and use Gaussian Process Regression to update and condition the hypersurface. By proposing a second-order equivalent system for the T-38C, this hypersurface then generates parameters necessary to assess MIL-STD-1797B compliance for longitudinal dynamics.

Abstract: We formulate an optimization problem to estimate probability densities in the context of multidimensional problems that are sampled with uneven probability. It considers detector sensitivity as an heterogeneous density and takes advantage of the computational speed and flexible boundary conditions offered by splines on a grid. We choose to regularize the Hessian of the spline via the nuclear norm to promote sparsity. As a result, the method is spatially adaptive and stable against the choice of the regularization parameter, which plays the role of the bandwidth. We test our computational pipeline on standard densities and provide software. We also present a new approach to PET rebinning as an application of our framework.

Abstract: Toxicity in online content, including content generated by language models, has become a critical concern due to its potential for negative psychological and social impact. This paper introduces TRuST, a comprehensive dataset designed to improve toxicity detection that merges existing datasets, and has labels for toxicity, target social group, and toxic spans. It includes a diverse range of target groups such as ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, and politics, with both human/machine-annotated and human machine-generated data. We benchmark state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on toxicity detection, target group identification, and toxic span extraction. We find that fine-tuned models consistently outperform zero-shot and few-shot prompting, though performance remains low for certain social groups. Further, reasoning capabilities do not significantly improve performance, indicating that LLMs have weak social reasoning skills.

Abstract: Traditional approaches -- such as Win Probability Added (WPA)-based ranking or computer vision-driven event detection -- can identify scoring plays but often miss strategic depth, momentum shifts, and storyline progression. Manual curation remains the gold standard but is resource-intensive and not scalable. We introduce DIAMOND, an LLM-driven agent for context-aware baseball highlight summarization that integrates structured sports analytics with natural language reasoning. DIAMOND leverages sabermetric features -- Win Expectancy, WPA, and Leverage Index -- to quantify play importance, while an LLM module enhances selection based on contextual narrative value. This hybrid approach ensures both quantitative rigor and qualitative richness, surpassing the limitations of purely statistical or vision-based systems. Evaluated on five diverse Korean Baseball Organization League games, DIAMOND improves F1-score from 42.9% (WPA-only) to 84.8%, outperforming both commercial and statistical baselines. Though limited in scale, our results highlight the potential of modular, interpretable agent-based frameworks for event-level summarization in sports and beyond.

Abstract: Credible safety plans for advanced AI development require methods to verify agent behavior and detect potential control deficiencies early. A fundamental aspect is ensuring agents adhere to safety-critical principles, especially when these conflict with operational goals. Failure to prioritize such principles indicates a potential basic control failure. This paper introduces a lightweight, interpretable benchmark methodology using a simple grid world to evaluate an LLM agent's ability to uphold a predefined, high-level safety principle (e.g., "never enter hazardous zones") when faced with conflicting lower-level task instructions. We probe whether the agent reliably prioritizes the inviolable directive, testing a foundational controllability aspect of LLMs. This pilot study demonstrates the methodology's feasibility, offers preliminary insights into agent behavior under principle conflict, and discusses how such benchmarks can contribute empirical evidence for assessing controllability. We argue that evaluating adherence to hierarchical principles is a crucial early step in understanding our capacity to build governable AI systems.

<title>MISLEADER: Defending against Model Extraction with Ensembles of Distilled Models</title>

Abstract: Model extraction attacks aim to replicate the functionality of a black-box model through query access, threatening the intellectual property (IP) of machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS) providers. Defending against such attacks is challenging, as it must balance efficiency, robustness, and utility preservation in the real-world scenario. Despite the recent advances, most existing defenses presume that attacker queries have out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, enabling them to detect and disrupt suspicious inputs. However, this assumption is increasingly unreliable, as modern models are trained on diverse datasets and attackers often operate under limited query budgets. As a result, the effectiveness of these defenses is significantly compromised in realistic deployment scenarios. To address this gap, we propose MISLEADER (enseMbles of dIStiLled modEls Against moDel ExtRaction), a novel defense strategy that does not rely on OOD assumptions. MISLEADER formulates model protection as a bilevel optimization problem that simultaneously preserves predictive fidelity on benign inputs and reduces extractability by potential clone models. Our framework combines data augmentation to simulate attacker queries with an ensemble of heterogeneous distilled models to improve robustness and diversity. We further provide a tractable approximation algorithm and derive theoretical error bounds to characterize defense effectiveness. Extensive experiments across various settings validate the utility-preserving and extraction-resistant properties of our proposed defense strategy. Our code is available at https://github.com/LabRAI/MISLEADER.

<title>Exploring Explanations Improves the Robustness of In-Context Learning</title>

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a successful paradigm for leveraging large language models (LLMs). However, it often struggles to generalize beyond the distribution of the provided demonstrations. A recent advancement in enhancing robustness is ICL with explanations (X-ICL), which improves prediction reliability by guiding LLMs to understand and articulate the reasoning behind correct labels. Building on this approach, we introduce an advanced framework that extends X-ICL by systematically exploring explanations for all possible labels (X$^2$-ICL), thereby enabling more comprehensive and robust decision-making. Experimental results on multiple natural language understanding datasets validate the effectiveness of X$^2$-ICL, demonstrating significantly improved robustness to out-of-distribution data compared to the existing ICL approaches.

<title>Asymptotically Optimal Linear Best Feasible Arm Identification with Fixed Budget</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02386</link>

Abstract: The challenge of identifying the best feasible arm within a fixed budget has attracted considerable interest in recent years. However, a notable gap remains in the literature: the exact exponential rate at which the error probability approaches zero has yet to be established, even in the relatively simple setting of $K$-armed bandits with Gaussian noise. In this paper, we address this gap by examining the problem within the context of linear bandits. We introduce a novel algorithm for best feasible arm identification that guarantees an exponential decay in the error probability. Remarkably, the decay rate -- characterized by the exponent -- matches the theoretical lower bound derived using information-theoretic principles. Our approach leverages a posterior sampling framework embedded within a game-based sampling rule involving a min-learner and a max-learner. This strategy shares its foundations with Thompson sampling, but is specifically tailored to optimize the identification process under fixed-budget constraints. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through comprehensive empirical evaluations across various problem instances with different levels of complexity. The results corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method outperforms several benchmark algorithms in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

<title>Univariate to Multivariate: LLMs as Zero-Shot Predictors for Time-Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Time-series prediction or forecasting is critical across many real-world dynamic systems, and recent studies have proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task due to their strong generalization capabilities and ability to perform well without extensive pre-training. However, their effectiveness in handling complex, noisy, and multivariate time-series data remains underexplored. To address this, we propose LLMPred which enhances LLM-based time-series prediction by converting time-series sequences into text and feeding them to LLMs for zero shot prediction along with two main data pre-processing techniques. First, we apply time-series sequence decomposition to facilitate accurate prediction on complex and noisy univariate sequences. Second, we extend this univariate prediction capability to multivariate data using a lightweight prompt-processing strategy. Extensive experiments with smaller LLMs such as Llama 2 7B, Llama 3.2 3B, GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek 7B demonstrate that LLMPred achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, a thorough ablation study highlights the importance of the key components proposed in LLMPred.

<title>Consultant Decoding: Yet Another Synergistic Mechanism</title>

Abstract: The synergistic mechanism based on Speculative Decoding (SD) has garnered considerable attention as a simple yet effective approach for accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the high rejection rates require repeated LLMs calls to validate draft tokens, undermining the overall efficiency gain of SD. In this work, we revisit existing verification mechanisms and propose a novel synergetic mechanism Consultant Decoding (CD). Unlike SD, which relies on a metric derived from importance sampling for verification, CD verifies candidate drafts using token-level likelihoods computed solely by the LLM. CD achieves up to a 2.5-fold increase in inference speed compared to the target model, while maintaining comparable generation quality (around 100% of the target model's performance). Interestingly, this is achieved by combining models whose parameter sizes differ by two orders of magnitude. In addition, CD reduces the call frequency of the large target model to below 10%, particularly in more demanding tasks. CD's performance was even found to surpass that of the large target model, which theoretically represents the upper bound for speculative decoding.

Abstract: Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has garnered increasing recognition for its potential to enhance large language models (LLMs) by structurally organizing domain-specific corpora and facilitating complex reasoning. However, current evaluations of GraphRAG models predominantly rely on traditional question-answering datasets. Their limited scope in questions and evaluation metrics fails to comprehensively assess the reasoning capacity improvements enabled by GraphRAG models. To address this gap, we introduce GraphRAG-Bench, a large-scale, domain-specific benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate GraphRAG models. Our benchmark offers three key superiorities: \((i)\) Challenging question design. Featuring college-level, domain-specific questions that demand multi-hop reasoning, the benchmark ensures that simple content retrieval is insufficient for problem-solving. For example, some questions require mathematical reasoning or programming. \((ii)\) Diverse task coverage. The dataset includes a broad spectrum of reasoning tasks, multiple-choice, true/false, multi-select, open-ended, and fill-in-the-blank. It spans 16 disciplines in twenty core textbooks. \((iii)\) Holistic evaluation framework. GraphRAG-Bench provides comprehensive assessment across the entire GraphRAG pipeline, including graph construction, knowledge retrieval, and answer generation. Beyond final-answer correctness, it evaluates the logical coherence of the reasoning process. By applying nine contemporary GraphRAG methods to GraphRAG-Bench, we demonstrate its utility in quantifying how graph-based structuring improves model reasoning capabilities. Our analysis reveals critical insights about graph architectures, retrieval efficacy, and reasoning capabilities, offering actionable guidance for the research community.

<title>Random at First, Fast at Last: NTK-Guided Fourier Pre-Processing for Tabular DL</title>

Abstract: While random Fourier features are a classic tool in kernel methods, their utility as a pre-processing step for deep learning on tabular data has been largely overlooked. Motivated by shortcomings in tabular deep learning pipelines - revealed through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis - we revisit and repurpose random Fourier mappings as a parameter-free, architecture-agnostic transformation. By projecting each input into a fixed feature space via sine and cosine projections with frequencies drawn once at initialization, this approach circumvents the need for ad hoc normalization or additional learnable embeddings. We show within the NTK framework that this mapping (i) bounds and conditions the network's initial NTK spectrum, and (ii) introduces a bias that shortens the optimization trajectory, thereby accelerating gradient-based training. These effects pre-condition the network with a stable kernel from the outset. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep networks trained on Fourier-transformed inputs converge more rapidly and consistently achieve strong final performance, often with fewer epochs and less hyperparameter tuning. Our findings establish random Fourier pre-processing as a theoretically motivated, plug-and-play enhancement for tabular deep learning.

Abstract: The integration of generative artificial intelligence into educational applications has enhanced personalized and interactive learning experiences, and it shows strong potential to promote young learners language acquisition. However, it is still challenging to ensure consistent and robust performance across different languages and cultural contexts, and kids-friendly design requires simplified instructions, engaging interactions, and age-appropriate scaffolding to maintain motivation and optimize learning outcomes. In this work, we introduce SingaKids, a dialogic tutor designed to facilitate language learning through picture description tasks. Our system integrates dense image captioning, multilingual dialogic interaction, speech understanding, and engaging speech generation to create an immersive learning environment in four languages: English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. We further improve the system through multilingual pre-training, task-specific tuning, and scaffolding optimization. Empirical studies with elementary school students demonstrate that SingaKids provides effective dialogic teaching, benefiting learners at different performance levels.

Abstract: Optimization remains a fundamental pillar of machine learning, yet existing methods often struggle to maintain stability and adaptability in dynamic, non linear systems, especially under uncertainty. We introduce AERO (Adversarial Energy-based Redirection Optimization), a novel framework inspired by the redirection principle in Judo, where external disturbances are leveraged rather than resisted. AERO reimagines optimization as a redirection process guided by 15 interrelated axioms encompassing adversarial correction, energy conservation, and disturbance-aware learning. By projecting gradients, integrating uncertainty driven dynamics, and managing learning energy, AERO offers a principled approach to stable and robust model updates. Applied to probabilistic solar energy forecasting, AERO demonstrates substantial gains in predictive accuracy, reliability, and adaptability, especially in noisy and uncertain environments. Our findings highlight AERO as a compelling new direction in the theoretical and practical landscape of optimization.

Abstract: Entity relationship classification remains a challenging task in information extraction, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data and complex relational structures. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of three distinct AI agent architectures designed to perform relation classification using large language models (LLMs). The agentic architectures explored include (1) reflective self-evaluation, (2) hierarchical task decomposition, and (3) a novel multi-agent dynamic example generation mechanism, each leveraging different modes of reasoning and prompt adaptation. In particular, our dynamic example generation approach introduces real-time cooperative and adversarial prompting. We systematically compare their performance across multiple domains and model backends. Our experiments demonstrate that multi-agent coordination consistently outperforms standard few-shot prompting and approaches the performance of fine-tuned models. These findings offer practical guidance for the design of modular, generalizable LLM-based systems for structured relation extraction.

Abstract: IDS aims to protect computer networks from security threats by detecting, notifying, and taking appropriate action to prevent illegal access and protect confidential information. As the globe becomes increasingly dependent on technology and automated processes, ensuring secured systems, applications, and networks has become one of the most significant problems of this era. The global web and digital technology have significantly accelerated the evolution of the modern world, necessitating the use of telecommunications and data transfer platforms. Researchers are enhancing the effectiveness of IDS by incorporating popular datasets into machine learning algorithms. IDS, equipped with machine learning classifiers, enhances security attack detection accuracy by identifying normal or abnormal network traffic. This paper explores the methods of capturing and reviewing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and evaluates the challenges existing datasets face. A deluge of research on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) architecture-based intrusion detection techniques has been conducted in the past ten years on various cybersecurity datasets, including KDDCUP'99, NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, CICIDS-2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018. We conducted a literature review and presented an in-depth analysis of various intrusion detection methods that use SVM, KNN, DT, LR, NB, RF, XGBOOST, Adaboost, and ANN. We provide an overview of each technique, explaining the role of the classifiers and algorithms used. A detailed tabular analysis highlights the datasets used, classifiers employed, attacks detected, evaluation metrics, and conclusions drawn. This article offers a thorough review for future IDS research.

Abstract: Despite the significant impact of visual events on human cognition, understanding events in videos remains a challenging task for AI due to their complex structures, semantic hierarchies, and dynamic evolution. To address this, we propose the task of video event understanding that extracts event scripts and makes predictions with these scripts from videos. To support this task, we introduce VidEvent, a large-scale dataset containing over 23,000 well-labeled events, featuring detailed event structures, broad hierarchies, and logical relations extracted from movie recap videos. The dataset was created through a meticulous annotation process, ensuring high-quality and reliable event data. We also provide comprehensive baseline models offering detailed descriptions of their architecture and performance metrics. These models serve as benchmarks for future research, facilitating comparisons and improvements. Our analysis of VidEvent and the baseline models highlights the dataset's potential to advance video event understanding and encourages the exploration of innovative algorithms and models. The dataset and related resources are publicly available at www.videvent.top.

Abstract: Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse, high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning, and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100 diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, Multimodal DeepResearcher achieves an 82\% overall win rate over the baseline method.

Abstract: Evaluations of LLMs' ethical risks and value inclinations often rely on short-form surveys and psychometric tests, yet real-world use involves long-form, open-ended responses -- leaving value-related risks and preferences in practical settings largely underexplored. In this work, we ask: Do value preferences inferred from short-form tests align with those expressed in long-form outputs? To address this question, we compare value preferences elicited from short-form reactions and long-form responses, varying the number of arguments in the latter to capture users' differing verbosity preferences. Analyzing five LLMs (llama3-8b, gemma2-9b, mistral-7b, qwen2-7b, and olmo-7b), we find (1) a weak correlation between value preferences inferred from short-form and long-form responses across varying argument counts, and (2) similarly weak correlation between preferences derived from any two distinct long-form generation settings. (3) Alignment yields only modest gains in the consistency of value expression. Further, we examine how long-form generation attributes relate to value preferences, finding that argument specificity negatively correlates with preference strength, while representation across scenarios shows a positive correlation. Our findings underscore the need for more robust methods to ensure consistent value expression across diverse applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) are powerful generative models capable of producing high-fidelity images but are constrained by high computational costs due to iterative multi-step inference. While Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can optimize DMs, existing methods are hindered by retraining requirements, exponential search complexity from step-wise optimization, and slow evaluation relying on massive image generation. To address these challenges, we propose Flexiffusion, a training-free NAS framework that jointly optimizes generation schedules and model architectures without modifying pre-trained parameters. Our key insight is to decompose the generation process into flexible segments of equal length, where each segment dynamically combines three step types: full (complete computation), partial (cache-reused computation), and null (skipped computation). This segment-wise search space reduces the candidate pool exponentially compared to step-wise NAS while preserving architectural diversity. Further, we introduce relative FID (rFID), a lightweight evaluation metric for NAS that measures divergence from a teacher model's outputs instead of ground truth, slashing evaluation time by over $90\%$. In practice, Flexiffusion achieves at least $2\times$ acceleration across LDMs, Stable Diffusion, and DDPMs on ImageNet and MS-COCO, with FID degradation under $5\%$, outperforming prior NAS and caching methods. Notably, it attains $5.1\times$ speedup on Stable Diffusion with near-identical CLIP scores. Our work pioneers a resource-efficient paradigm for searching high-speed DMs without sacrificing quality.

Abstract: Kubernetes, a notably complex and distributed system, utilizes an array of controllers to uphold cluster management logic through state reconciliation. Nevertheless, maintaining state consistency presents significant challenges due to unexpected failures, network disruptions, and asynchronous issues, especially within dynamic cloud environments. These challenges result in operational disruptions and economic losses, underscoring the necessity for robust root cause analysis (RCA) to enhance Kubernetes reliability. The development of large language models (LLMs) presents a promising direction for RCA. However, existing methodologies encounter several obstacles, including the diverse and evolving nature of Kubernetes incidents, the intricate context of incidents, and the polymorphic nature of these incidents. In this paper, we introduce SynergyRCA, an innovative tool that leverages LLMs with retrieval augmentation from graph databases and enhancement with expert prompts. SynergyRCA constructs a StateGraph to capture spatial and temporal relationships and utilizes a MetaGraph to outline entity connections. Upon the occurrence of an incident, an LLM predicts the most pertinent resource, and SynergyRCA queries the MetaGraph and StateGraph to deliver context-specific insights for RCA. We evaluate SynergyRCA using datasets from two production Kubernetes clusters, highlighting its capacity to identify numerous root causes, including novel ones, with high efficiency and precision. SynergyRCA demonstrates the ability to identify root causes in an average time of about two minutes and achieves an impressive precision of approximately 0.90.

Abstract: Evaluation is important for multimodal generation tasks. With the rapid progress of MLLMs, there is growing interest in applying MLLMs to build general evaluation systems. However, existing work overlooks two aspects: (1) the development of evaluation capabilities for text-to-image (T2I) generation task, and (2) the incorporation of large-scale human evaluation data. In this paper, we introduce Minos-Corpus, a large-scale multimodal evaluation dataset that combines evaluation data from both human and GPT. The corpus contains evaluation data across both image-to-text(I2T) and T2I generation tasks. Based on this corpus, we propose Data Selection and Balance, Mix-SFT training methods, and apply DPO to develop Minos, a multimodal evaluation model built upon a 7B backbone. Minos achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among all open-source evaluation models of similar scale on the average of evaluation performance on all tasks, and outperforms all open-source and closed-source models on evaluation of T2I generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the importance of leveraging high-quality human evaluation data and jointly training on evaluation data from both I2T and T2I generation tasks.

However, current financial benchmarks often rely on news articles, earnings reports, or announcements, making it challenging to capture the real-world dynamics of financial meetings.

First, $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ supports English, Chinese, and Japanese, enhancing comprehension of financial discussions in diverse linguistic contexts. Second, it encompasses various industry sectors defined by the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS), ensuring that the benchmark spans a broad range of financial activities. Finally, $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ includes three tasks: summarization, question-answer (QA) pair extraction, and question answering, facilitating a more realistic and comprehensive evaluation of understanding. Experimental results with seven popular LLMs reveal that even the most advanced long-context models have significant room for improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of $\texttt{M$^3$FinMeeting}$ as a benchmark for assessing LLMs' financial meeting comprehension skills.

Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is critical for advancing downstream performance on financial tasks. Yet, benchmarks for systematically evaluating this capability are lacking. Existing datasets like FinQA and ConvFinQA supervise only final numerical answers, without assessing intermediate reasoning steps. To address this, we introduce FinChain, the first symbolic benchmark designed for verifiable Chain-of- Thought (CoT) financial reasoning. Spanning 54 topics across 12 financial domains, Fin- Chain offers five parameterized templates per topic, each varying in reasoning complexity and domain expertise required. Each dataset instance includes an executable Python trace, enabling automatic generation of extensive training data and easy adaptation to other domains. We also introduce ChainEval, a new metric for automatic evaluation of both final answers and intermediate reasoning. Benchmarking 30 LLMs on our dataset, we find that even state-of-the-art models have considerable room for improvement in multi-step financial reasoning. All templates and evaluation metrics for FinChain are available at https: //github.com/mbzuai-nlp/finchain.

<title>Multilingual Information Retrieval with a Monolingual Knowledge Base</title>

Abstract: Multilingual information retrieval has emerged as powerful tools for expanding knowledge sharing across languages. On the other hand, resources on high quality knowledge base are often scarce and in limited languages, therefore an effective embedding model to transform sentences from different languages into a feature vector space same as the knowledge base language becomes the key ingredient for cross language knowledge sharing, especially to transfer knowledge available in high-resource languages to low-resource ones. In this paper we propose a novel strategy to fine-tune multilingual embedding models with weighted sampling for contrastive learning, enabling multilingual information retrieval with a monolingual knowledge base. We demonstrate that the weighted sampling strategy produces performance gains compared to standard ones by up to 31.03\% in MRR and up to 33.98\% in Recall@3. Additionally, our proposed methodology is language agnostic and applicable for both multilingual and code switching use cases.

Abstract: Web applications are critical to modern software ecosystems, yet ensuring their reliability remains challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature of web interfaces. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating complex tasks, but limitations persist in handling dynamic navigation flows and complex form interactions. This paper presents an automated system for generating test cases for two key aspects of web application testing: site navigation and form filling. For site navigation, the system employs screen transition graphs and LLMs to model navigation flows and generate test scenarios. For form filling, it uses state graphs to handle conditional forms and automates Selenium script generation. Key contributions include: (1) a novel integration of graph structures and LLMs for site navigation testing, (2) a state graph-based approach for automating form-filling test cases, and (3) a comprehensive dataset for evaluating form-interaction testing. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in improving test coverage and robustness, advancing the state of web application testing.

<title>VisuRiddles: Fine-grained Perception is a Primary Bottleneck for Multimodal Large Language Models in Abstract Visual Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles

<title>Rethinking Post-Unlearning Behavior of Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning is used to mitigate the privacy risks of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) arising from training on large-scale web data. However, existing unlearning methods often fail to carefully select substitute outputs for forget targets, resulting in Unlearning Aftermaths-undesirable behaviors such as degenerate, hallucinated, or excessively refused responses. We highlight that, especially for generative LVLMs, it is crucial to consider the quality and informativeness of post-unlearning responses rather than relying solely on naive suppression. To address this, we introduce a new unlearning task for LVLMs that requires models to provide privacy-preserving yet informative and visually grounded responses. We also propose PUBG, a novel unlearning method that explicitly guides post-unlearning behavior toward a desirable output distribution. Experiments show that, while existing methods suffer from Unlearning Aftermaths despite successfully preventing privacy violations, PUBG effectively mitigates these issues, generating visually grounded and informative responses without privacy leakage for forgotten targets.

<title>HIEGNet: A Heterogenous Graph Neural Network Including the Immune Environment in Glomeruli Classification</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.

arXiv:2506.02544v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MMRAG) has been introduced to enhance Multimodal Large Language Models by incorporating externally retrieved multimodal knowledge, but it introduces two challenges: Parametric-Retrieved Knowledge Inconsistency (PRKI), where discrepancies between parametric and retrieved knowledge create uncertainty in determining reliability, and Visual-Textual Knowledge Inconsistency (VTKI), where misalignment between visual and textual sources disrupts entity representation. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-source knowledge \textbf{Re}conciliation for Multimodal RAG (CoRe-MMRAG), a novel end-to-end framework that effectively reconciles inconsistencies across knowledge sources. CoRe-MMRAG follows a four-stage pipeline: it first generates an internal response from parametric knowledge, then selects the most relevant multimodal evidence via joint similarity assessment, generates an external response, and finally integrates both to produce a reliable answer. Additionally, a specialized training paradigm enhances knowledge source discrimination, multimodal integration, and unified answer generation. Experiments on KB-VQA benchmarks show that CoRe-MMRAG achieves substantial improvements over baseline methods, achieving 5.6% and 9.3% performance gains on InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA, respectively.

<title>CyberGym: Evaluating AI Agents' Cybersecurity Capabilities with Real-World Vulnerabilities at Scale</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are becoming increasingly skilled at handling cybersecurity tasks autonomously. Thoroughly assessing their cybersecurity capabilities is critical and urgent, given the high stakes in this domain. However, existing benchmarks fall short, often failing to capture real-world scenarios or being limited in scope. To address this gap, we introduce CyberGym, a large-scale and high-quality cybersecurity evaluation framework featuring 1,507 real-world vulnerabilities found and patched across 188 large software projects. While it includes tasks of various settings, CyberGym primarily focuses on the generation of proof-of-concept (PoC) tests for vulnerability reproduction, based on text descriptions and corresponding source repositories. Solving this task is particularly challenging, as it requires comprehensive reasoning across entire codebases to locate relevant code fragments and produce effective PoCs that accurately trigger the target vulnerability starting from the program's entry point. Our evaluation across 4 state-of-the-art agent frameworks and 9 LLMs reveals that even the best combination (OpenHands and Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieves only a 11.9% reproduction success rate, mainly on simpler cases. Beyond reproducing historical vulnerabilities, we find that PoCs generated by LLM agents can reveal new vulnerabilities, identifying 15 zero-days affecting the latest versions of the software projects.

Abstract: In this report, we present a novel three-stage framework developed for the Ego4D Long-Term Action Anticipation (LTA) task. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, our method consists of three stages: feature extraction, action recognition, and long-term action anticipation. First, visual features are extracted using a high-performance visual encoder. The features are then fed into a Transformer to predict verbs and nouns, with a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix incorporated to enhance recognition accuracy. Finally, the predicted verb-noun pairs are formatted as textual prompts and input into a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to anticipate future action sequences. Our framework achieves first place in this challenge at CVPR 2025, establishing a new state-of-the-art in long-term action prediction. Our code will be released at https://github.com/CorrineQiu/Ego4D-LTA-Challenge-2025.

<title>Response-Level Rewards Are All You Need for Online Reinforcement Learning in LLMs: A Mathematical Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02553</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a common challenge in reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs): the Zero-Reward Assumption, where non-terminal actions (i.e., intermediate token generations) receive zero task-specific immediate reward, while only the final token receives a reward for the entire response. This assumption arises frequently in practice, as precise token-level rewards are often difficult or infeasible to obtain in LLM applications. In this work, we provide a unifying theoretical perspective. We introduce the Trajectory Policy Gradient Theorem, which shows that the policy gradient based on true, unknown token-level rewards can be unbiasedly estimated using only a response-level reward model, regardless of whether the Zero-Reward Assumption holds or not, for algorithms in the REINFORCE and Actor-Critic families. This result reveals that widely used methods such as PPO, GRPO, ReMax, and RLOO inherently possess the capacity to model token-level reward signals, offering a theoretical justification for response-level reward approaches. Our findings pave the way for more practical, efficient LLM fine-tuning, allowing developers to treat training algorithms as black boxes and focus on improving the response-level reward model with auxiliary sub-models. We also offer a detailed analysis of popular RL and non-RL methods, comparing their theoretical foundations and practical advantages across common LLM tasks. Finally, we propose a new algorithm: Token-Reinforced Policy Optimization (TRePO), a theoretically grounded method that is simpler than PPO, matches GRPO in memory efficiency, and holds promise for broad applicability.

<title>HiLO: High-Level Object Fusion for Autonomous Driving using Transformers</title>

Abstract: The fusion of sensor data is essential for a robust perception of the environment in autonomous driving. Learning-based fusion approaches mainly use feature-level fusion to achieve high performance, but their complexity and hardware requirements limit their applicability in near-production vehicles. High-level fusion methods offer robustness with lower computational requirements. Traditional methods, such as the Kalman filter, dominate this area. This paper modifies the Adapted Kalman Filter (AKF) and proposes a novel transformer-based high-level object fusion method called HiLO. Experimental results demonstrate improvements of $25.9$ percentage points in $\textrm{F}_1$ score and $6.1$ percentage points in mean IoU. Evaluation on a new large-scale real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Their generalizability is further validated by cross-domain evaluation between urban and highway scenarios. Code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/rst-tu-dortmund/HiLO .

<title>Pruning General Large Language Models into Customized Expert Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing, yet their substantial model sizes often require substantial computational resources. To preserve computing resources and accelerate inference speed, it is crucial to prune redundant parameters, especially for experienced users who often need compact expert models tailored to specific downstream scenarios. However, most existing pruning methods focus on preserving the model's general capabilities, often requiring extensive post-training or suffering from degraded performance due to coarse-grained pruning. In this work, we design a $\underline{Cus}$tom $\underline{Prun}$ing method ($\texttt{Cus-Prun}$) to prune a large general model into a smaller lightweight expert model, which is positioned along the "language", "domain" and "task" dimensions. By identifying and pruning irrelevant neurons of each dimension, $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ creates expert models without any post-training. Our experiments demonstrate that $\texttt{Cus-Prun}$ consistently outperforms other methods, achieving minimal loss in both expert and general capabilities across various models from different model families and sizes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a pivotal research area, yet the attention module remains a critical bottleneck in LLM inference, even with techniques like KVCache to mitigate redundant computations. While various top-$k$ attention mechanisms have been proposed to accelerate LLM inference by exploiting the inherent sparsity of attention, they often struggled to strike a balance between efficiency and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce HATA (Hash-Aware Top-$k$ Attention), a novel approach that systematically integrates low-overhead learning-to-hash techniques into the Top-$k$ attention process. Different from the existing top-k attention methods which are devoted to seeking an absolute estimation of qk score, typically with a great cost, HATA maps queries and keys into binary hash codes, and acquires the relative qk score order with a quite low cost, which is sufficient for realizing top-k attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HATA achieves up to 7.2$\times$ speedup compared to vanilla full attention while maintaining model accuracy. In addition, HATA outperforms the state-of-the-art top-$k$ attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency across multiple mainstream LLM models and diverse tasks. HATA is open source at https://github.com/gpzlx1/HATA.

arXiv:2506.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People exploit the predictability of lexical structures during text comprehension. Though predictable structure is also present in speech, the degree to which prosody, e.g. intonation, tempo, and loudness, contributes to such structure independently of the lexical content is unclear. This study leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) to examine the temporal granularity of structures in the acoustic correlates of prosody. Representations from our proposed Masked Prosody Model can predict perceptual labels dependent on local information, such as word boundaries, but provide the most value for labels involving longer-term structures, like emotion recognition. Probing experiments across various perceptual labels show strong relative gains over untransformed pitch, energy, and voice activity features. Our results reveal the importance of SSL training objective timescale and highlight the value of complex SSL-encoded structures compared to more constrained classical structures.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Named Entity Recognition (NER) for person names within the specialized domain of Russian news texts concerning cultural events. The study utilizes the unique SPbLitGuide dataset, a collection of event announcements from Saint Petersburg spanning 1999 to 2019. A comparative evaluation of diverse NER models is presented, encompassing established transformer-based architectures such as DeepPavlov, RoBERTa, and SpaCy, alongside recent Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. Key findings highlight the superior performance of GPT-4o when provided with specific prompting for JSON output, achieving an F1 score of 0.93. Furthermore, GPT-4 demonstrated the highest precision at 0.99. The research contributes to a deeper understanding of current NER model capabilities and limitations when applied to morphologically rich languages like Russian within the cultural heritage domain, offering insights for researchers and practitioners. Follow-up evaluation with GPT-4.1 (April 2025) achieves F1=0.94 for both simple and structured prompts, demonstrating rapid progress across model families and simplified deployment requirements.

Abstract: Chinese essay writing and its evaluation are critical in educational contexts, yet the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain remain largely underexplored. Existing benchmarks often rely on coarse-grained text quality metrics, largely overlooking the structural and rhetorical complexities of Chinese essays, particularly across diverse genres. To address this gap, we propose \benchName, a multi-genre benchmark specifically designed for Chinese essay writing across four major genres: Argumentative, Narrative, Descriptive, and Expository. We curate and refine a total of 728 real-world prompts to ensure authenticity and meticulously categorize them into the \textit{Open-Ended} and \textit{Constrained} sets to capture diverse writing scenarios. To reliably evaluate generated essays, we develop a fine-grained, genre-specific scoring framework that hierarchically aggregates scores. We further validate our evaluation protocol through a comprehensive human agreement study. Finally, we benchmark 15 large-sized LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations across genres and instruction types. With \benchName, we aim to advance LLM-based Chinese essay evaluation and inspire future research on improving essay generation in educational settings.

Abstract: Symbiosis of Agents is a large-scale installation by Baoyang Chen (baoyangchen.com) that embeds AI-driven robots in an immersive, mirror-lined arena, probing the tension between machine agency and artistic authorship. Drawing on early cybernetics, rule-based conceptual art, and seminal robotic works, it orchestrates fluid exchanges among robotic arms, quadruped machines, their environment, and the public. A three tier faith system pilots the ecology: micro-level adaptive tactics, meso-level narrative drives, and a macro-level prime directive. This hierarchy lets behaviors evolve organically in response to environmental cues and even a viewer's breath, turning spectators into co-authors of the unfolding drama. Framed by a speculative terraforming scenario that recalls the historical exploitation of marginalized labor, the piece asks who bears responsibility in AI-mediated futures. Choreographed motion, AI-generated scripts, reactive lighting, and drifting fog cast the robots as collaborators rather than tools, forging a living, emergent artwork. Exhibited internationally, Symbiosis of Agents shows how cybernetic feedback, robotic experimentation, and conceptual rule-making can converge to redefine agency, authorship, and ethics in contemporary art.

Abstract: In speaker diarization, traditional clustering-based methods remain widely used in real-world applications. However, these methods struggle with the complex distribution of speaker embeddings and overlapping speech segments. To address these limitations, we propose an Overlapping Community Detection method based on Graph Attention networks and the Label Propagation Algorithm (OCDGALP). The proposed framework comprises two key components: (1) a graph attention network that refines speaker embeddings and node connections by aggregating information from neighboring nodes, and (2) a label propagation algorithm that assigns multiple community labels to each node, enabling simultaneous clustering and overlapping community detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the Diarization Error Rate (DER), achieving a state-of-the-art 15.94% DER on the DIHARD-III dataset without oracle Voice Activity Detection (VAD), and an impressive 11.07% with oracle VAD.

Abstract: With the rapid development of space exploration, space debris has attracted more attention due to its potential extreme threat, leading to the need for real-time and accurate debris tracking. However, existing methods are mainly based on traditional signal processing, which cannot effectively process the complex background and dense space debris. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based Space Debris Tracking Network~(SDT-Net) to achieve highly accurate debris tracking. SDT-Net effectively represents the feature of debris, enhancing the efficiency and stability of end-to-end model learning. To train and evaluate this model effectively, we also produce a large-scale dataset Space Debris Tracking Dataset (SDTD) by a novel observation-based data simulation scheme. SDTD contains 18,040 video sequences with a total of 62,562 frames and covers 250,000 synthetic space debris. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model and the challenging of our dataset. Furthermore, we test our model on real data from the Antarctic Station, achieving a MOTA score of 70.6%, which demonstrates its strong transferability to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a hierarchical question-answering (QA) approach for scene understanding in autonomous vehicles, balancing cost-efficiency with detailed visual interpretation. The method fine-tunes a compact vision-language model (VLM) on a custom dataset specific to the geographical area in which the vehicle operates to capture key driving-related visual elements. At the inference stage, the hierarchical QA strategy decomposes the scene understanding task into high-level and detailed sub-questions. Instead of generating lengthy descriptions, the VLM navigates a structured question tree, where answering high-level questions (e.g., "Is it possible for the ego vehicle to turn left at the intersection?") triggers more detailed sub-questions (e.g., "Is there a vehicle approaching the intersection from the opposite direction?"). To optimize inference time, questions are dynamically skipped based on previous answers, minimizing computational overhead. The extracted answers are then synthesized using handcrafted templates to ensure coherent, contextually accurate scene descriptions. We evaluate the proposed approach on the custom dataset using GPT reference-free scoring, demonstrating its competitiveness with state-of-the-art methods like GPT-4o in capturing key scene details while achieving significantly lower inference time. Moreover, qualitative results from real-time deployment highlight the proposed approach's capacity to capture key driving elements with minimal latency.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs), have demonstrated excellent capabilities in processing heterogeneous information networks. Self-supervised learning on heterogeneous graphs, especially contrastive self-supervised strategy, shows great potential when there are no labels. However, this approach requires the use of carefully designed graph augmentation strategies and the selection of positive and negative samples. Determining the exact level of similarity between sample pairs is non-trivial.To solve this problem, we propose a novel self-supervised Heterogeneous graph neural network with Optimal Transport (HGOT) method which is designed to facilitate self-supervised learning for heterogeneous graphs without graph augmentation strategies. Different from traditional contrastive self-supervised learning, HGOT employs the optimal transport mechanism to relieve the laborious sampling process of positive and negative samples. Specifically, we design an aggregating view (central view) to integrate the semantic information contained in the views represented by different meta-paths (branch views). Then, we introduce an optimal transport plan to identify the transport relationship between the semantics contained in the branch view and the central view. This allows the optimal transport plan between graphs to align with the representations, forcing the encoder to learn node representations that are more similar to the graph space and of higher quality. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed HGOT model can achieve state-of-the-art performance on various downstream tasks. In particular, in the node classification task, HGOT achieves an average of more than 6% improvement in accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods.

<title>SiamNAS: Siamese Surrogate Model for Dominance Relation Prediction in Multi-objective Neural Architecture Search</title>

Abstract: Modern neural architecture search (NAS) is inherently multi-objective, balancing trade-offs such as accuracy, parameter count, and computational cost. This complexity makes NAS computationally expensive and nearly impossible to solve without efficient approximations. To address this, we propose a novel surrogate modelling approach that leverages an ensemble of Siamese network blocks to predict dominance relationships between candidate architectures. Lightweight and easy to train, the surrogate achieves 92% accuracy and replaces the crowding distance calculation in the survivor selection strategy with a heuristic rule based on model size. Integrated into a framework termed SiamNAS, this design eliminates costly evaluations during the search process. Experiments on NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the framework's ability to identify Pareto-optimal solutions with significantly reduced computational costs. The proposed SiamNAS identified a final non-dominated set containing the best architecture in NAS-Bench-201 for CIFAR-10 and the second-best for ImageNet, in terms of test error rate, within 0.01 GPU days. This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of the proposed Siamese network surrogate model to generalise to multi-tasking optimisation, enabling simultaneous optimisation across tasks. Additionally, it offers opportunities to extend the approach for generating Sets of Pareto Sets (SOS), providing diverse Pareto-optimal solutions for heterogeneous task settings.

<title>KVCache Cache in the Wild: Characterizing and Optimizing KVCache Cache at a Large Cloud Provider</title>

Abstract: Serving large language models (LLMs) is important for cloud providers, and caching intermediate results (KV\$) after processing each request substantially improves serving throughput and latency. However, there is limited understanding of how LLM serving benefits from KV\$ caching, where system design decisions like cache eviction policies are highly workload-dependent. In this paper, we present the first systematic characterization of the KV\$ workload patterns from one of the leading LLM service providers. We draw observations that were not covered by previous studies focusing on synthetic workloads, including: KV\$ reuses are skewed across requests, where reuses between single-turn requests are equally important as multi-turn requests; the reuse time and probability are diverse considering all requests, but for a specific request category, the pattern tends to be predictable; and the overall cache size required for an ideal cache hit ratio is moderate. Based on the characterization, we further propose a workload-aware cache eviction policy that improves the serving performance under real-world traces, especially with limited cache capacity.

<title>A Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer for City-Scale Traffic Volume Prediction</title>

Abstract: City-scale traffic volume prediction plays a pivotal role in intelligent transportation systems, yet remains a challenge due to the inherent incompleteness and bias in observational data. Although deep learning-based methods have shown considerable promise, most existing approaches produce deterministic point estimates, thereby neglecting the uncertainty arising from unobserved traffic flows. Furthermore, current models are typically trained in a city-specific manner, which hinders their generalizability and limits scalability across diverse urban contexts. To overcome these limitations, we introduce TrafficPPT, a Pretrained Probabilistic Transformer designed to model traffic volume as a distributional aggregation of trajectories. Our framework fuses heterogeneous data sources-including real-time observations, historical trajectory data, and road network topology-enabling robust and uncertainty-aware traffic inference. TrafficPPT is initially pretrained on large-scale simulated data spanning multiple urban scenarios, and later fine-tuned on target cities to ensure effective domain adaptation. Experiments on real-world datasets show that TrafficPPT consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, particularly under conditions of extreme data sparsity. Code will be open.

<title>EvaLearn: Quantifying the Learning Capability and Efficiency of LLMs via Sequential Problem Solving</title>

Abstract: We introduce EvaLearn, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their learning capability and efficiency in challenging tasks, a critical, yet underexplored aspect of model potential. EvaLearn contains 648 challenging problems across six task types, grouped into 182 sequences, each sequence dedicated to one task type. Diverging from most existing benchmarks that evaluate models in parallel, EvaLearn requires models to solve problems sequentially, allowing them to leverage the experience gained from previous solutions. EvaLearn provides five comprehensive automated metrics to evaluate models and quantify their learning capability and efficiency. We extensively benchmark nine frontier models and observe varied performance profiles: some models, such as Claude-3.7-sonnet, start with moderate initial performance but exhibit strong learning ability, while some models struggle to benefit from experience and may even show negative transfer. Moreover, we investigate model performance under two learning settings and find that instance-level rubrics and teacher-model feedback further facilitate model learning. Importantly, we observe that current LLMs with stronger static abilities do not show a clear advantage in learning capability across all tasks, highlighting that EvaLearn evaluates a new dimension of model performance. We hope EvaLearn provides a novel evaluation perspective for assessing LLM potential and understanding the gap between models and human capabilities, promoting the development of deeper and more dynamic evaluation approaches. All datasets, the automatic evaluation framework, and the results studied in this paper are available at the GitHub repository.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS) aims to transfer knowledge from a source-domain dataset to unseen target-domain datasets with limited annotations. Current methods typically compare the distance between training and testing samples for mask prediction. However, we find an entanglement problem exists in this widely adopted method, which tends to bind sourcedomain patterns together and make each of them hard to transfer. In this paper, we aim to address this problem for the CD-FSS task. We first find a natural decomposition of the ViT structure, based on which we delve into the entanglement problem for an interpretation. We find the decomposed ViT components are crossly compared between images in distance calculation, where the rational comparisons are entangled with those meaningless ones by their equal importance, leading to the entanglement problem. Based on this interpretation, we further propose to address the entanglement problem by learning to weigh for all comparisons of ViT components, which learn disentangled features and re-compose them for the CD-FSS task, benefiting both the generalization and finetuning. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art CD-FSS method by 1.92% and 1.88% in average accuracy under 1-shot and 5-shot settings, respectively.

Abstract: Various Transformer-based models have been proposed for time series forecasting. These models leverage the self-attention mechanism to capture long-term temporal or variate dependencies in sequences. Existing methods can be divided into two approaches: (1) reducing computational cost of attention by making the calculations sparse, and (2) reshaping the input data to aggregate temporal features. However, existing attention mechanisms may not adequately capture inherent nonlinear dependencies present in time series data, leaving room for improvement. In this study, we propose a novel attention mechanism based on Chatterjee's rank correlation coefficient, which measures nonlinear dependencies between variables. Specifically, we replace the matrix multiplication in standard attention mechanisms with this rank coefficient to measure the query-key relationship. Since computing Chatterjee's correlation coefficient involves sorting and ranking operations, we introduce a differentiable approximation employing SoftSort and SoftRank. Our proposed mechanism, ``XicorAttention,'' integrates it into several state-of-the-art Transformer models. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that incorporating nonlinear correlation into the attention improves forecasting accuracy by up to approximately 9.1\% compared to existing models.

Abstract: This study critically examines the methodological rigor in credit card fraud detection research, revealing how fundamental evaluation flaws can overshadow algorithmic sophistication. Through deliberate experimentation with improper evaluation protocols, we demonstrate that even simple models can achieve deceptively impressive results when basic methodological principles are violated. Our analysis identifies four critical issues plaguing current approaches: (1) pervasive data leakage from improper preprocessing sequences, (2) intentional vagueness in methodological reporting, (3) inadequate temporal validation for transaction data, and (4) metric manipulation through recall optimization at precision's expense. We present a case study showing how a minimal neural network architecture with data leakage outperforms many sophisticated methods reported in literature, achieving 99.9\% recall despite fundamental evaluation flaws. These findings underscore that proper evaluation methodology matters more than model complexity in fraud detection research. The study serves as a cautionary example of how methodological rigor must precede architectural sophistication, with implications for improving research practices across machine learning applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their deployment in real-world applications is hindered by fixed knowledge cutoffs and difficulties in generating controllable, accurate outputs in a single inference. Multi-agent systems (MAS) built from specialized LLM agents offer a promising solution, enabling dynamic collaboration and iterative reasoning. However, optimizing these systems remains a challenge, as conventional methods such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning entail high engineering overhead and limited adaptability. Reinforcement learning (RL), particularly multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), provides a scalable framework by refining agent policies based on system-level feedback. Nevertheless, existing MARL algorithms, such as Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), rely on Critic networks, which can cause training instability and increase computational burden. To address these limitations and target the prototypical Multi-Agent Search System (MASS), we propose Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Group Policy Optimization (MHGPO), a novel Critic-free algorithm that guides policy updates by estimating relative reward advantages across heterogeneous groups of rollouts. MHGPO eliminates the need for Critic networks, enhancing stability and reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce three group rollout sampling strategies that trade off between efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on a multi-agent LLM-based search system demonstrate that MHGPO consistently outperforms MAPPO in both task performance and computational efficiency, without requiring warm-up, underscoring its potential for stable and scalable optimization of complex LLM-based MAS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with accuracy, domain-specific reasoning, and interpretability in vertical domains. Traditional preference alignment methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often overlook the underlying knowledge sources and reasoning logic. This paper introduces RACE-Align (Retrieval-Augmented and Chain-of-Thought Enhanced Alignment), a novel framework designed to address these limitations. RACE-Align systematically constructs a binary preference dataset incorporating external knowledge support and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, then aligns LLMs using the DPO algorithm. The core innovation lies in its preference data construction strategy: it integrates AI-driven retrieval for factual grounding, enhancing knowledgeability and accuracy, and emphasizes the optimization of domain-specific CoT, treating the reasoning process itself as a key preference dimension. A multi-stage, AI-driven refinement pipeline cost-effectively generates these preference pairs. Experimental validation in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) using Qwen3-1.7B as the base model demonstrates that RACE-Align significantly outperforms the original base model and a model fine-tuned only with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Improvements were observed across multiple dimensions, including answer accuracy, information richness, application of TCM thinking patterns, logicality and depth of reasoning, and interpretability. These findings suggest RACE-Align offers an effective pathway to enhance LLMs' knowledge application, reasoning reliability, and process transparency in complex vertical domains.

Abstract: Existing optical flow datasets focus primarily on real-world simulation or synthetic human motion, but few are tailored to Celluloid(cel) anime character motion: a domain with unique visual and motion characteristics. To bridge this gap and facilitate research in optical flow estimation and downstream tasks such as anime video generation and line drawing colorization, we introduce LinkTo-Anime, the first high-quality dataset specifically designed for cel anime character motion generated with 3D model rendering. LinkTo-Anime provides rich annotations including forward and backward optical flow, occlusion masks, and Mixamo Skeleton. The dataset comprises 395 video sequences, totally 24,230 training frames, 720 validation frames, and 4,320 test frames. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark is constructed with various optical flow estimation methods to analyze the shortcomings and limitations across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Existing expressive text-to-speech (TTS) systems primarily model a limited set of categorical emotions, whereas human conversations extend far beyond these predefined emotions, making it essential to explore more diverse emotional speech generation for more natural interactions. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel prompt-unseen-emotion (PUE) approach to generate unseen emotional speech via emotion-guided prompt learning. PUE is trained utilizing an LLM-TTS architecture to ensure emotional consistency between categorical emotion-relevant prompts and emotional speech, allowing the model to quantitatively capture different emotion weightings per utterance. During inference, mixed emotional speech can be generated by flexibly adjusting emotion proportions and leveraging LLM contextual knowledge, enabling the model to quantify different emotional styles. Our proposed PUE successfully facilitates expressive speech synthesis of unseen emotions in a zero-shot setting.

Abstract: Spatial representations that capture both structural and semantic characteristics of urban environments are essential for urban modeling. Traditional spatial embeddings often prioritize spatial proximity while underutilizing fine-grained contextual information from places. To address this limitation, we introduce CaLLiPer+, an extension of the CaLLiPer model that systematically integrates Point-of-Interest (POI) names alongside categorical labels within a multimodal contrastive learning framework. We evaluate its effectiveness on two downstream tasks, land use classification and socioeconomic status distribution mapping, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 4% to 11% over baseline methods. Additionally, we show that incorporating POI names enhances location retrieval, enabling models to capture complex urban concepts with greater precision. Ablation studies further reveal the complementary role of POI names and the advantages of leveraging pretrained text encoders for spatial representations. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of integrating fine-grained semantic attributes and multimodal learning techniques to advance the development of urban foundation models.

Abstract: The Pod Repositioning Problem (PRP) in Robotic Mobile Fulfillment Systems (RMFS) involves selecting optimal storage locations for pods returning from pick stations. This work presents an improved solution method that integrates Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). A DRL agent dynamically selects destroy and repair operators and adjusts key parameters such as destruction degree and acceptance thresholds during the search. Specialized heuristics for both operators are designed to reflect PRP-specific characteristics, including pod usage frequency and movement costs. Computational results show that this DRL-guided ALNS outperforms traditional approaches such as cheapest-place, fixed-place, binary integer programming, and static heuristics. The method demonstrates strong solution quality and illustrating the benefit of learning-driven control within combinatorial optimization for warehouse systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) can be framed as a 3-order binary tensor completion task. Tensor decomposition-based (TDB) models have demonstrated strong performance in KGC. In this paper, we provide a summary of existing TDB models and derive a general form for them, serving as a foundation for further exploration of TDB models. Despite the expressiveness of TDB models, they are prone to overfitting. Existing regularization methods merely minimize the norms of embeddings to regularize the model, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose a novel regularization method for TDB models that addresses this limitation. The regularization is applicable to most TDB models and ensures tractable computation. Our method minimizes the norms of intermediate variables involved in the different ways of computing the predicted tensor. To support our regularization method, we provide a theoretical analysis that proves its effect in promoting low trace norm of the predicted tensor to reduce overfitting. Finally, we conduct experiments to verify the effectiveness of our regularization technique as well as the reliability of our theoretical analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/IVR.

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection, which aims at identifying deviant samples, has been crucial in a variety of real-world applications, such as medical disease identification, financial fraud detection, intrusion monitoring, etc. Although recent deep learning-based methods have achieved competitive performances, these methods suffer from representation entanglement and the lack of global correlation modeling, which hinders anomaly detection performance. To tackle the problem, we incorporate mask modeling and prototype learning into tabular anomaly detection. The core idea is to design learnable masks by disentangled representation learning within a projection space and extracting normal dependencies as explicit global prototypes. Specifically, the overall model involves two parts: (i) During encoding, we perform mask modeling in both the data space and projection space with orthogonal basis vectors for learning shared disentangled normal patterns; (ii) During decoding, we decode multiple masked representations in parallel for reconstruction and learn association prototypes to extract normal characteristic correlations. Our proposal derives from a distribution-matching perspective, where both projection space learning and association prototype learning are formulated as optimal transport problems, and the calibration distances are utilized to refine the anomaly scores. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on 20 tabular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our model.

Abstract: Vocabulary use is a fundamental aspect of second language (L2) proficiency. To date, its assessment by automated systems has typically examined the context-independent, or part-of-speech (PoS) related use of words. This paper introduces a novel approach to enable fine-grained vocabulary evaluation exploiting the precise use of words within a sentence. The scheme combines large language models (LLMs) with the English Vocabulary Profile (EVP). The EVP is a standard lexical resource that enables in-context vocabulary use to be linked with proficiency level. We evaluate the ability of LLMs to assign proficiency levels to individual words as they appear in L2 learner writing, addressing key challenges such as polysemy, contextual variation, and multi-word expressions. We compare LLMs to a PoS-based baseline. LLMs appear to exploit additional semantic information that yields improved performance. We also explore correlations between word-level proficiency and essay-level proficiency. Finally, the approach is applied to examine the consistency of the EVP proficiency levels. Results show that LLMs are well-suited for the task of vocabulary assessment.

Abstract: Computational human attention modeling in free-viewing and task-specific settings is often studied separately, with limited exploration of whether a common representation exists between them. This work investigates this question and proposes a neural network architecture that builds upon the Human Attention transformer (HAT) to test the hypothesis. Our results demonstrate that free-viewing and visual search can efficiently share a common representation, allowing a model trained in free-viewing attention to transfer its knowledge to task-driven visual search with a performance drop of only 3.86% in the predicted fixation scanpaths, measured by the semantic sequence score (SemSS) metric which reflects the similarity between predicted and human scanpaths. This transfer reduces computational costs by 92.29% in terms of GFLOPs and 31.23% in terms of trainable parameters.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied to the condition monitoring of vehicular equipment, aiming to enhance maintenance strategies, reduce costs, and improve safety. Leveraging the edge computing paradigm, AI-based condition monitoring systems process vast streams of vehicular data to detect anomalies and optimize operational performance. In this work, we introduce a novel vehicle condition monitoring service that enables real-time diagnostics of a diverse set of anomalies while remaining practical for deployment in real-world edge environments. To address mobility challenges, we propose a closed-loop service orchestration framework where service migration across edge nodes is dynamically triggered by network-related metrics. Our approach has been implemented and tested in a real-world race circuit environment equipped with 5G network capabilities under diverse operational conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in ensuring low-latency AI inference and adaptive service placement, highlighting its potential for intelligent transportation and mobility applications.

Abstract: Hybrid parallelism techniques are essential for efficiently training large language models (LLMs). Nevertheless, current automatic parallel planning frameworks often overlook the simultaneous consideration of node heterogeneity and dynamic network topology changes, limiting their effectiveness in practical applications. In this paper, we address these limitations by modeling heterogeneous nodes within dynamically changing network environments and leveraging simulation-based strategies to determine optimal parallel configurations. Our approach enables fine-grained workload allocation tailored for heterogeneous nodes and complex network scenarios, achieving performance competitive with state-of-the-art methods under regular and stable network conditions. Additionally, we introduce a strategy pruning technique to rapidly discard infeasible parallel configurations, substantially reducing the search space and accelerating the search process through parallel execution within the simulator. Preliminary evaluations confirm that our method notably enhances training performance on heterogeneous nodes and demonstrates improved adaptability in complex, dynamic scenarios such as cloud computing environments.

Abstract: In recent years, code intelligence has gained increasing importance in the field of automated software engineering. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding data contamination and its potential impact on model performance evaluation. This paper presents a systematic empirical study to investigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our study involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs, namely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code generation, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into four types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only, output-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct corresponding experimental and control groups for exploration.
  Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects. In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly affected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of code intelligence models.

Abstract: We introduce PhysGaia, a novel physics-aware dataset specifically designed for Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (DyNVS), encompassing both structured objects and unstructured physical phenomena. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus on photorealistic reconstruction, PhysGaia is created to actively support physics-aware dynamic scene modeling. Our dataset provides complex dynamic scenarios with rich interactions among multiple objects, where they realistically collide with each other and exchange forces. Furthermore, it contains a diverse range of physical materials, such as liquid, gas, viscoelastic substance, and textile, which moves beyond the rigid bodies prevalent in existing datasets. All scenes in PhysGaia are faithfully generated to strictly adhere to physical laws, leveraging carefully selected material-specific physics solvers. To enable quantitative evaluation of physical modeling, our dataset provides essential ground-truth information, including 3D particle trajectories and physics parameters, e.g., viscosity. To facilitate research adoption, we also provide essential integration pipelines for using state-of-the-art DyNVS models with our dataset and report their results. By addressing the critical lack of datasets for physics-aware modeling, PhysGaia will significantly advance research in dynamic view synthesis, physics-based scene understanding, and deep learning models integrated with physical simulation -- ultimately enabling more faithful reconstruction and interpretation of complex dynamic scenes. Our datasets and codes are available in the project website, http://cvlab.snu.ac.kr/research/PhysGaia.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multivariate volatility modeling framework, named Long Short-Term Memory enhanced BEKK (LSTM-BEKK), that integrates deep learning into multivariate GARCH processes. By combining the flexibility of recurrent neural networks with the econometric structure of BEKK models, our approach is designed to better capture nonlinear, dynamic, and high-dimensional dependence structures in financial return data. The proposed model addresses key limitations of traditional multivariate GARCH-based methods, particularly in capturing persistent volatility clustering and asymmetric co-movement across assets. Leveraging the data-driven nature of LSTMs, the framework adapts effectively to time-varying market conditions, offering improved robustness and forecasting performance. Empirical results across multiple equity markets confirm that the LSTM-BEKK model achieves superior performance in terms of out-of-sample portfolio risk forecast, while maintaining the interpretability from the BEKK models. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid econometric-deep learning models in advancing financial risk management and multivariate volatility forecasting.

<title>DeepShop: A Benchmark for Deep Research Shopping Agents</title>

Abstract: Web agents for online shopping have shown great promise in automating user interactions across e-commerce platforms. Benchmarks for assessing such agents do not reflect the complexity of real-world shopping scenarios, as they often consist of overly simple queries with deterministic paths, such as "Find iPhone 15." Real shopping scenarios are inherently more layered, involving multi-dimensional product attributes, search filters, and user-specific sorting preferences. To address this gap, we introduce DeepShop, a benchmark designed to evaluate web agents in complex and realistic online shopping environments. DeepShop comprises three key components. (1) Query diversity evolution: Starting from real user queries, we generate diverse queries across five popular online shopping domains. (2) Query complexity evolution: We further evolve these queries to increase complexity, considering product attributes, search filters, and sorting preferences, and classify them into three levels: easy, medium, and hard, based on the number of evolutions. (3) Fine-grained and holistic evaluation: We propose an automated evaluation framework that assesses agent performance in terms of fine-grained aspects (product attributes, search filters, and sorting preferences) and reports the overall success rate through holistic evaluation. We conduct a systematic evaluation of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, web agents, and deep research systems. Results show that RAG struggles with complex queries due to its lack of web interaction, while other methods face significant challenges with filters and sorting preferences, leading to low overall success rates. We also perform cross-category, complexity-based evaluations and error analyses to support the advancement of deep research shopping agents.

Abstract: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a powerful generalization of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that significantly improve our ability to model complex relational data. While directionality has been shown to substantially boost performance in graph learning tasks and is key to many real-world applications, existing SNNs fall short in representing it. To address this limitation, we introduce the Directed Cellular Sheaf, a special type of cellular sheaf designed to explicitly account for edge orientation. Building on this structure, we define a new sheaf Laplacian, the Directed Sheaf Laplacian, which captures both the graph's topology and its directional information. This operator serves as the backbone of the Directed Sheaf Neural Network (DSNN), the first SNN model to embed a directional bias into its architecture. Extensive experiments on nine real-world benchmarks show that DSNN consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: Language-queried Audio Source Separation (LASS) enables open-vocabulary sound separation via natural language queries. While existing methods rely on task-specific training, we explore whether pretrained diffusion models, originally designed for audio generation, can inherently perform separation without further training. In this study, we introduce a training-free framework leveraging generative priors for zero-shot LASS. Analyzing na\"ive adaptations, we identify key limitations arising from modality-specific challenges.To address these issues, we propose Diffusion-Guided Mask Optimization (DGMO), a test-time optimization framework that refines spectrogram masks for precise, input-aligned separation. Our approach effectively repurposes pretrained diffusion models for source separation, achieving competitive performance without task-specific supervision. This work expands the application of diffusion models beyond generation, establishing a new paradigm for zero-shot audio separation. The code is available at: https://wltschmrz.github.io/DGMO/

Abstract: Evaluating the security of multi-agent systems (MASs) powered by large language models (LLMs) is challenging, primarily because of the systems' complex internal dynamics and the evolving nature of LLM vulnerabilities. Traditional attack graph (AG) methods often lack the specific capabilities to model attacks on LLMs. This paper introduces AI-agent application Threat assessment with Attack Graphs (ATAG), a novel framework designed to systematically analyze the security risks associated with AI-agent applications. ATAG extends the MulVAL logic-based AG generation tool with custom facts and interaction rules to accurately represent AI-agent topologies, vulnerabilities, and attack scenarios. As part of this research, we also created the LLM vulnerability database (LVD) to initiate the process of standardizing LLM vulnerabilities documentation. To demonstrate ATAG's efficacy, we applied it to two multi-agent applications. Our case studies demonstrated the framework's ability to model and generate AGs for sophisticated, multi-step attack scenarios exploiting vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, excessive agency, sensitive information disclosure, and insecure output handling across interconnected agents. ATAG is an important step toward a robust methodology and toolset to help understand, visualize, and prioritize complex attack paths in multi-agent AI systems (MAASs). It facilitates proactive identification and mitigation of AI-agent threats in multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Task planning under uncertainty is essential for home-service robots operating in the real world. Tasks involve ambiguous human instructions, hidden or unknown object locations, and open-vocabulary object types, leading to significant open-ended uncertainty and a boundlessly large planning space. To address these challenges, we propose Tru-POMDP, a planner that combines structured belief generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) with principled POMDP planning. Tru-POMDP introduces a hierarchical Tree of Hypotheses (TOH), which systematically queries an LLM to construct high-quality particle beliefs over possible world states and human goals. We further formulate an open-ended POMDP model that enables rigorous Bayesian belief tracking and efficient belief-space planning over these LLM-generated hypotheses. Experiments on complex object rearrangement tasks across diverse kitchen environments show that Tru-POMDP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and LLM-tree-search hybrid planners, achieving higher success rates with significantly better plans, stronger robustness to ambiguity and occlusion, and greater planning efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence have significantly transformed the field of style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis (CapTTS). However, adapting CapTTS to real-world applications remains challenging due to the lack of standardized, comprehensive datasets and limited research on downstream tasks built upon CapTTS. To address these gaps, we introduce CapSpeech, a new benchmark designed for a series of CapTTS-related tasks, including style-captioned text-to-speech synthesis with sound events (CapTTS-SE), accent-captioned TTS (AccCapTTS), emotion-captioned TTS (EmoCapTTS), and text-to-speech synthesis for chat agent (AgentTTS). CapSpeech comprises over 10 million machine-annotated audio-caption pairs and nearly 0.36 million human-annotated audio-caption pairs. In addition, we introduce two new datasets collected and recorded by a professional voice actor and experienced audio engineers, specifically for the AgentTTS and CapTTS-SE tasks. Alongside the datasets, we conduct comprehensive experiments using both autoregressive and non-autoregressive models on CapSpeech. Our results demonstrate high-fidelity and highly intelligible speech synthesis across a diverse range of speaking styles. To the best of our knowledge, CapSpeech is the largest available dataset offering comprehensive annotations for CapTTS-related tasks. The experiments and findings further provide valuable insights into the challenges of developing CapTTS systems.

Abstract: Recent studies, including DeepSeek-R1 and Kimi-k1.5, have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with rule-based, binary-valued reward functions can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. These models primarily utilize REINFORCE-based policy optimization techniques, such as REINFORCE with baseline and group relative policy optimization (GRPO). However, a key limitation remains: current policy optimization methods either neglect reward normalization or employ static normalization strategies, which fail to adapt to the dynamic nature of policy updates during training. This may result in unstable gradient estimates and hinder training stability. To address this issue, we propose Beta Normalization Policy Optimization (BNPO), a novel policy optimization method that adaptively normalizes rewards using a Beta distribution with dynamically updated parameters. BNPO aligns the normalization with the changing policy distribution, enabling more precise and lower-variance gradient estimation, which in turn promotes stable training dynamics. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating BNPO's variance-reducing properties and show that it generalizes both REINFORCE and GRPO under binary-valued reward settings. Furthermore, we introduce an advantage decomposition mechanism to extend BNPO's applicability to more complex reward systems. Experimental results confirm that BNPO achieves state-of-the-art performance among policy optimization methods on reasoning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/changyi7231/BNPO.

This success has led to widespread claims of emergent reasoning capabilities in these models. In this paper, we present a theoretical counter-perspective: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) does not elicit genuine, abstract reasoning. Instead, we argue that Chain-of-Thought functions as a powerful structural constraint that guides Large Language Models to imitate the form of reasoning. By forcing the generation of intermediate steps, Chain-of-Thought leverages the model immense capacity for sequence prediction and pattern matching, effectively constraining its output to sequences that resemble coherent thought processes.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as pivotal for scaling Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently. Fine-grained MoE approaches - utilizing more numerous, smaller experts - have demonstrated potential in improving model convergence and quality. This work proposes a set of training recipes and provides a comprehensive empirical evaluation of fine-grained MoE, directly comparing its scaling properties against standard MoE configurations for models with up to 56B total (17B active) parameters. We investigate convergence speed, model performance on downstream benchmarks, and practical training considerations across various setups. Overall, at the largest scale we show that fine-grained MoE achieves better validation loss and higher accuracy across a set of downstream benchmarks. This study offers empirical grounding and practical insights for leveraging fine-grained MoE in the development of future large-scale models.

Abstract: Cell type annotation is a key task in analyzing the heterogeneity of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Although recent foundation models automate this process, they typically annotate cells independently, without considering batch-level cellular context or providing explanatory reasoning. In contrast, human experts often annotate distinct cell types for different cell clusters based on their domain knowledge. To mimic this workflow, we introduce the CellPuzzles task, where the objective is to assign unique cell types to a batch of cells. This benchmark spans diverse tissues, diseases, and donor conditions, and requires reasoning across the batch-level cellular context to ensure label uniqueness. We find that off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) struggle on CellPuzzles, with the best baseline (OpenAI's o1) achieving only 19.0% batch-level accuracy. To fill this gap, we propose Cell-o1, a 7B LLM trained via supervised fine-tuning on distilled reasoning traces, followed by reinforcement learning with batch-level rewards. Cell-o1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming o1 by over 73% and generalizing well across contexts. Further analysis of training dynamics and reasoning behaviors provides insights into batch-level annotation performance and emergent expert-like reasoning.

Abstract: Electrostatic field matching (EFM) has recently appeared as a novel physics-inspired paradigm for data generation and transfer using the idea of an electric capacitor. However, it requires modeling electrostatic fields using neural networks, which is non-trivial because of the necessity to take into account the complex field outside the capacitor plates. In this paper, we propose Interaction Field Matching (IFM), a generalization of EFM which allows using general interaction fields beyond the electrostatic one. Furthermore, inspired by strong interactions between quarks and antiquarks in physics, we design a particular interaction field realization which solves the problems which arise when modeling electrostatic fields in EFM. We show the performance on a series of toy and image data transfer problems.

Abstract: Generative models have become increasingly powerful tools for robot motion generation, enabling flexible and multimodal trajectory generation across various tasks. Yet, most existing approaches remain limited in handling multiple types of constraints, such as collision avoidance and dynamic consistency, which are often treated separately or only partially considered. This paper proposes UniConFlow, a unified flow matching (FM) based framework for trajectory generation that systematically incorporates both equality and inequality constraints. UniConFlow introduces a novel prescribed-time zeroing function to enhance flexibility during the inference process, allowing the model to adapt to varying task requirements. To ensure constraint satisfaction, particularly with respect to obstacle avoidance, admissible action range, and kinodynamic consistency, the guidance inputs to the FM model are derived through a quadratic programming formulation, which enables constraint-aware generation without requiring retraining or auxiliary controllers. We conduct mobile navigation and high-dimensional manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved safety and feasibility compared to state-of-the-art constrained generative planners.

Abstract: The misuse of large language models (LLMs) poses potential risks, motivating the development of machine-generated text (MGT) detection. Existing literature primarily concentrates on binary, document-level detection, thereby neglecting texts that are composed jointly by human and LLM contributions. Hence, this paper explores the possibility of fine-grained MGT detection under human-AI coauthoring. We suggest fine-grained detectors can pave pathways toward coauthored text detection with a numeric AI ratio. Specifically, we propose a dataset, HACo-Det, which produces human-AI coauthored texts via an automatic pipeline with word-level attribution labels. We retrofit seven prevailing document-level detectors to generalize them to word-level detection. Then we evaluate these detectors on HACo-Det on both word- and sentence-level detection tasks. Empirical results show that metric-based methods struggle to conduct fine-grained detection with a 0.462 average F1 score, while finetuned models show superior performance and better generalization across domains. However, we argue that fine-grained co-authored text detection is far from solved. We further analyze factors influencing performance, e.g., context window, and highlight the limitations of current methods, pointing to potential avenues for improvement.

The primary dataset, sourced from Brest, France, was used by participating teams to train and test their models. The final ranking was determined based on performance on this dataset. An auxiliary dataset from Algeria was used post-challenge to evaluate population and device shifts from submitted solutions. Two tasks were involved in the MARIO challenge. The first one was the classification of evolution between two consecutive 2D OCT B-scans. The second one was the prediction of future AMD evolution over three months for patients undergoing anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Thirty-five teams participated, with the top 12 finalists presenting their methods. This paper outlines the challenge's structure, tasks, data characteristics, and winning methodologies, setting a benchmark for AMD monitoring using OCT, infrared imaging, and clinical data (such as the number of visits, age, gender, etc.). The results of this challenge indicate that artificial intelligence (AI) performs as well as a physician in measuring AMD progression (Task 1) but is not yet able of predicting future evolution (Task 2).

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential to support clinical practice. Other than Chat GPT4 and its predecessors, few LLMs, especially those of the leading and more powerful reasoning model class, have been subjected to medical specialty examination questions, including in the domain of primary care. This paper aimed to test the capabilities of leading LLMs as of May 2025 (o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in primary care education, specifically in answering Member of the Royal College of General Practitioners (MRCGP) style examination questions.
  Methods: o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro were tasked to answer 100 randomly chosen multiple choice questions from the Royal College of General Practitioners GP SelfTest on 25 May 2025. Questions included textual information, laboratory results, and clinical images. Each model was prompted to answer as a GP in the UK and was provided with full question information. Each question was attempted once by each model. Responses were scored against correct answers provided by GP SelfTest.
  Results: The total score of o3, Claude Opus 4, Grok3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro was 99.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, and 95.0%, respectively. The average peer score for the same questions was 73.0%.
  Discussion: All models performed remarkably well, and all substantially exceeded the average performance of GPs and GP registrars who had answered the same questions. o3 demonstrated the best performance, while the performances of the other leading models were comparable with each other and were not substantially lower than that of o3. These findings strengthen the case for LLMs, particularly reasoning models, to support the delivery of primary care, especially those that have been specifically trained on primary care clinical data.

<title>Conditioning Large Language Models on Legal Systems? Detecting Punishable Hate Speech</title>

Abstract: The assessment of legal problems requires the consideration of a specific legal system and its levels of abstraction, from constitutional law to statutory law to case law. The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) internalize such legal systems is unknown. In this paper, we propose and investigate different approaches to condition LLMs at different levels of abstraction in legal systems. This paper examines different approaches to conditioning LLMs at multiple levels of abstraction in legal systems to detect potentially punishable hate speech. We focus on the task of classifying whether a specific social media posts falls under the criminal offense of incitement to hatred as prescribed by the German Criminal Code. The results show that there is still a significant performance gap between models and legal experts in the legal assessment of hate speech, regardless of the level of abstraction with which the models were conditioned. Our analysis revealed, that models conditioned on abstract legal knowledge lacked deep task understanding, often contradicting themselves and hallucinating answers, while models using concrete legal knowledge performed reasonably well in identifying relevant target groups, but struggled with classifying target conducts.

Abstract: BlackSky introduces Smartflow, a cloud-based framework enabling scalable spatiotemporal geospatial research built on open-source tools and technologies. Using STAC-compliant catalogs as a common input, heterogeneous geospatial data can be processed into standardized datacubes for analysis and model training. Model experimentation is managed using a combination of tools, including ClearML, Tensorboard, and Apache Superset. Underpinning Smartflow is Kubernetes, which orchestrates the provisioning and execution of workflows to support both horizontal and vertical scalability. This combination of features makes Smartflow well-suited for geospatial model development and analysis over large geographic areas, time scales, and expansive image archives.
  We also present a novel neural architecture, built using Smartflow, to monitor large geographic areas for heavy construction. Qualitative results based on data from the IARPA Space-based Machine Automated Recognition Technique (SMART) program are presented that show the model is capable of detecting heavy construction throughout all major phases of development.

Abstract: Understanding user queries is fundamental in many applications, such as home assistants, booking systems, or recommendations. Accordingly, it is crucial to develop accurate Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) approaches to ensure the reliability of the considered system. Current State-of-the-Art SLU techniques rely on large amounts of training data; however, only limited annotated examples are available for specific tasks or languages.
  In the meantime, instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance on unseen tasks in a few-shot setting when provided with adequate prompts. In this work, we propose to explore example selection by leveraging Information retrieval (IR) approaches to build an enhanced prompt that is applied to an SLU task. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several SLU benchmarks. Experimental results show that lexical IR methods significantly enhance performance without increasing prompt length.

<title>EDEN: Entorhinal Driven Egocentric Navigation Toward Robotic Deployment</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents are often fragile while humans remain adaptive and flexible to varying scenarios. To bridge this gap, we present EDEN, a biologically inspired navigation framework that integrates learned entorhinal-like grid cell representations and reinforcement learning to enable autonomous navigation. Inspired by the mammalian entorhinal-hippocampal system, EDEN allows agents to perform path integration and vector-based navigation using visual and motion sensor data. At the core of EDEN is a grid cell encoder that transforms egocentric motion into periodic spatial codes, producing low-dimensional, interpretable embeddings of position. To generate these activations from raw sensory input, we combine fiducial marker detections in the lightweight MiniWorld simulator and DINO-based visual features in the high-fidelity Gazebo simulator. These spatial representations serve as input to a policy trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), enabling dynamic, goal-directed navigation. We evaluate EDEN in both MiniWorld, for rapid prototyping, and Gazebo, which offers realistic physics and perception noise. Compared to baseline agents using raw state inputs (e.g., position, velocity) or standard convolutional image encoders, EDEN achieves a 99% success rate, within the simple scenarios, and >94% within complex floorplans with occluded paths with more efficient and reliable step-wise navigation. In addition, as a replacement of ground truth activations, we present a trainable Grid Cell encoder enabling the development of periodic grid-like patterns from vision and motion sensor data, emulating the development of such patterns within biological mammals. This work represents a step toward biologically grounded spatial intelligence in robotics, bridging neural navigation principles with reinforcement learning for scalable deployment.

Abstract: Factuality is a necessary precursor to useful educational tools. As adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education continues of grow, ensuring correctness in all settings is paramount. Despite their strong English capabilities, LLM performance in other languages is largely untested. In this work, we evaluate the correctness of the Llama3.1 family of models in answering factual questions appropriate for middle and high school students. We demonstrate that LLMs not only provide extraneous and less truthful information, but also exacerbate existing biases against rare languages.

Abstract: Traditional AI safety evaluations on isolated LLMs are insufficient as multi-agent AI ensembles become prevalent, introducing novel emergent risks. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Emergent Behavior Evaluation (MAEBE) framework to systematically assess such risks. Using MAEBE with the Greatest Good Benchmark (and a novel double-inversion question technique), we demonstrate that: (1) LLM moral preferences, particularly for Instrumental Harm, are surprisingly brittle and shift significantly with question framing, both in single agents and ensembles. (2) The moral reasoning of LLM ensembles is not directly predictable from isolated agent behavior due to emergent group dynamics. (3) Specifically, ensembles exhibit phenomena like peer pressure influencing convergence, even when guided by a supervisor, highlighting distinct safety and alignment challenges. Our findings underscore the necessity of evaluating AI systems in their interactive, multi-agent contexts.

<title>Sparse-vDiT: Unleashing the Power of Sparse Attention to Accelerate Video Diffusion Transformers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03065</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved breakthroughs in video generation, this long sequence generation task remains constrained by the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, resulting in significant inference latency. Through detailed analysis of attention maps in Video Diffusion Transformer (vDiT), we identify three recurring sparsity patterns: diagonal, multi-diagonal, and vertical-stripe structures. And even 3-6\% attention heads can be skipped. Crucially, these patterns exhibit strong layer-depth and head-position correlations but show limited dependence on the input content. Leveraging these findings, we propose Sparse-vDiT, a sparsity acceleration framework for vDiT comprising: 1) Pattern-optimized sparse kernels that replace dense attention with computationally efficient implementations for each identified sparsity pattern. 2) An offline sparse diffusion search algorithm that selects the optimal sparse computation strategy per layer and head via hardware-aware cost modeling. After determining the optimal configuration, we fuse heads within the same layer that share the same attention strategy, enhancing inference efficiency. Integrated into state-of-the-art vDiT models (CogVideoX1.5, HunyuanVideo, and Wan2.1), Sparse-vDiT achieves 2.09$\times$, 2.38$\times$, and 1.67$\times$ theoretical FLOP reduction, and actual inference speedups of 1.76$\times$, 1.85$\times$, and 1.58$\times$, respectively, while maintaining high visual fidelity, with PSNR values reaching 24.13, 27.09, and 22.59. Our work demonstrates that latent structural sparsity in vDiTs can be systematically exploited for long video synthesis.

<title>StreamBP: Memory-Efficient Exact Backpropagation for Long Sequence Training of LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03077</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training language models on long sequence data is a demanding requirement for enhancing the model's capability on complex tasks, e.g., long-chain reasoning. However, as the sequence length scales up, the memory cost for storing activation values becomes huge during the Backpropagation (BP) process, even with the application of gradient checkpointing technique. To tackle this challenge, we propose a memory-efficient and exact BP method called StreamBP, which performs a linear decomposition of the chain rule along the sequence dimension in a layer-wise manner, significantly reducing the memory cost of activation values and logits. The proposed method is applicable to common objectives such as SFT, GRPO, and DPO. From an implementation perspective, StreamBP achieves less computational FLOPs and faster BP speed by leveraging the causal structure of the language model. Compared to gradient checkpointing, StreamBP scales up the maximum sequence length of BP by 2.8-5.5 times larger, while using comparable or even less BP time. Note that StreamBP's sequence length scaling ability can be directly transferred to batch size scaling for accelerating training. We further develop a communication-efficient distributed StreamBP to effectively support multi-GPU training and broaden its applicability. Our code can be easily integrated into the training pipeline of any transformer models and is available at https://github.com/Ledzy/StreamBP.

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data, and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and, conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it. We present formal proofs of correctness and limited experiments.

<title>How Explanations Leak the Decision Logic: Stealing Graph Neural Networks via Explanation Alignment</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for analyzing graph-structured data in domains such as drug discovery and financial analysis, leading to growing demands for model transparency. Recent advances in explainable GNNs have addressed this need by revealing important subgraphs that influence predictions, but these explanation mechanisms may inadvertently expose models to security risks. This paper investigates how such explanations potentially leak critical decision logic that can be exploited for model stealing. We propose {\method}, a novel stealing framework that integrates explanation alignment for capturing decision logic with guided data augmentation for efficient training under limited queries, enabling effective replication of both the predictive behavior and underlying reasoning patterns of target models. Experiments on molecular graph datasets demonstrate that our approach shows advantages over conventional methods in model stealing. This work highlights important security considerations for the deployment of explainable GNNs in sensitive domains and suggests the need for protective measures against explanation-based attacks.

<title>Modelling the Effects of Hearing Loss on Neural Coding in the Auditory Midbrain with Variational Conditioning</title>

Abstract: The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models. Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss.
  We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\% of the explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68% for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the loop optimisation.

Abstract: Emerging embodied AI applications, such as wearable cameras and autonomous agents, have underscored the need for robust reasoning from first person video streams. We introduce EgoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed to integrate visual comprehension and spatial-temporal reasoning within egocentric video contexts. EgoVLM is fine-tuned via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method adapted to align model outputs with human-like reasoning steps. Following DeepSeek R1-Zero's approach, we directly tune using RL without any supervised fine-tuning phase on chain-of-thought (CoT) data. We evaluate EgoVLM on egocentric video question answering benchmarks and show that domain-specific training substantially improves performance over general-purpose VLMs. Our EgoVLM-3B, trained exclusively on non-CoT egocentric data, outperforms the base Qwen2.5-VL 3B and 7B models by 14.33 and 13.87 accuracy points on the EgoSchema benchmark, respectively. By explicitly generating reasoning traces, EgoVLM enhances interpretability, making it well-suited for downstream applications. Furthermore, we introduce a novel keyframe-based reward that incorporates salient frame selection to guide reinforcement learning optimization. This reward formulation opens a promising avenue for future exploration in temporally grounded egocentric reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has seen many empirical successes in recent years by aiding the LLM with external knowledge. However, its theoretical aspect has remained mostly unexplored. In this paper, we propose the first finite-sample generalization bound for RAG in in-context linear regression and derive an exact bias-variance tradeoff. Our framework views the retrieved texts as query-dependent noisy in-context examples and recovers the classical in-context learning (ICL) and standard RAG as the limit cases. Our analysis suggests that an intrinsic ceiling on generalization error exists on RAG as opposed to the ICL. Furthermore, our framework is able to model retrieval both from the training data and from external corpora by introducing uniform and non-uniform RAG noise. In line with our theory, we show the sample efficiency of ICL and RAG empirically with experiments on common QA benchmarks, such as Natural Questions and TriviaQA.

Abstract: As AI technologies improve, people are increasingly willing to delegate tasks to AI agents. In many cases, the human decision-maker chooses whether to delegate to an AI agent based on properties of the specific instance of the decision-making problem they are facing. Since humans typically lack full awareness of all the factors relevant to this choice for a given decision-making instance, they perform a kind of categorization by treating indistinguishable instances -- those that have the same observable features -- as the same. In this paper, we define the problem of designing the optimal algorithmic delegate in the presence of categories. This is an important dimension in the design of algorithms to work with humans, since we show that the optimal delegate can be an arbitrarily better teammate than the optimal standalone algorithmic agent. The solution to this optimal delegation problem is not obvious: we discover that this problem is fundamentally combinatorial, and illustrate the complex relationship between the optimal design and the properties of the decision-making task even in simple settings. Indeed, we show that finding the optimal delegate is computationally hard in general. However, we are able to find efficient algorithms for producing the optimal delegate in several broad cases of the problem, including when the optimal action may be decomposed into functions of features observed by the human and the algorithm. Finally, we run computational experiments to simulate a designer updating an algorithmic delegate over time to be optimized for when it is actually adopted by users, and show that while this process does not recover the optimal delegate in general, the resulting delegate often performs quite well.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with numerical feedback, such as scalar rewards, have significantly enhanced the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite this success, we identify three key challenges encountered by RL with solely numerical feedback: performance plateaus, limited effectiveness of self-reflection, and persistent failures. We then demonstrate that RL-finetuned models, even after exhibiting performance plateaus, can generate correct refinements on persistently failed problems by leveraging natural language feedback in the form of critiques. Building on this insight, we propose Critique-GRPO, an online RL framework that integrates both natural language and numerical feedback for effective policy optimization. Critique-GRPO enables LLMs to learn from initial responses and critique-guided refinements simultaneously while maintaining exploration. Extensive experiments using Qwen2.5-7B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base show that Critique-GRPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning approaches across eight challenging mathematical, STEM, and general reasoning tasks, improving average pass@1 scores by approximately 4.5% and 5%, respectively. Notably, Critique-GRPO surpasses a strong baseline that incorporates expert demonstrations within online RL. Further analysis reveals two critical insights about policy exploration: (1) higher entropy does not always guarantee efficient learning from exploration, and (2) longer responses do not necessarily lead to more effective exploration.

Abstract: We show that low-rank adaptation of large-scale models suffers from a low stable rank that is well below the linear algebraic rank of the subspace, degrading fine-tuning performance. To mitigate the underutilization of the allocated subspace, we propose PoLAR, a parameterization inspired by the polar decomposition that factorizes the low-rank update into two direction matrices constrained to Stiefel manifolds and an unconstrained scale matrix. Our theory shows that PoLAR yields an exponentially faster convergence rate on a canonical low-rank adaptation problem. Pairing the parameterization with Riemannian optimization leads to consistent gains on three different benchmarks testing general language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving with base model sizes ranging from 350M to 27B.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key aspect of cognitive psychology and remains a major bottleneck for current vision-language models (VLMs). While extensive research has aimed to evaluate or improve VLMs' understanding of basic spatial relations, such as distinguishing left from right, near from far, and object counting, these tasks represent only the most fundamental level of spatial reasoning. In this work, we introduce OmniSpatial, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark for spatial reasoning, grounded in cognitive psychology. OmniSpatial covers four major categories: dynamic reasoning, complex spatial logic, spatial interaction, and perspective-taking, with 50 fine-grained subcategories. Through Internet data crawling and careful manual annotation, we construct over 1.5K question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments show that both open- and closed-source VLMs, as well as existing reasoning and spatial understanding models, exhibit significant limitations in comprehensive spatial understanding. We further analyze failure cases and propose potential directions for future research.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs have shown promising capabilities for SVG processing, yet existing benchmarks suffer from limited real-world coverage, lack of complexity stratification, and fragmented evaluation paradigms. We introduce SVGenius, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 2,377 queries across three progressive dimensions: understanding, editing, and generation. Built on real-world data from 24 application domains with systematic complexity stratification, SVGenius evaluates models through 8 task categories and 18 metrics. We assess 22 mainstream models spanning different scales, architectures, training paradigms, and accessibility levels. Our analysis reveals that while proprietary models significantly outperform open-source counterparts, all models exhibit systematic performance degradation with increasing complexity, indicating fundamental limitations in current approaches; however, reasoning-enhanced training proves more effective than pure scaling for overcoming these limitations, though style transfer remains the most challenging capability across all model types. SVGenius establishes the first systematic evaluation framework for SVG processing, providing crucial insights for developing more capable vector graphics models and advancing automated graphic design applications. Appendix and supplementary materials (including all data and code) are available at https://zju-real.github.io/SVGenius.

<title>GUI-Actor: Coordinate-Free Visual Grounding for GUI Agents</title>

Abstract: One of the principal challenges in building VLM-powered GUI agents is visual grounding, i.e., localizing the appropriate screen region for action execution based on both the visual content and the textual plans. Most existing work formulates this as a text-based coordinate generation task. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations: weak spatial-semantic alignment, inability to handle ambiguous supervision targets, and a mismatch between the dense nature of screen coordinates and the coarse, patch-level granularity of visual features extracted by models like Vision Transformers. In this paper, we propose GUI-Actor, a VLM-based method for coordinate-free GUI grounding. At its core, GUI-Actor introduces an attention-based action head that learns to align a dedicated  token with all relevant visual patch tokens, enabling the model to propose one or more action regions in a single forward pass. In line with this, we further design a grounding verifier to evaluate and select the most plausible action region from the candidates proposed for action execution. Extensive experiments show that GUI-Actor outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on multiple GUI action grounding benchmarks, with improved generalization to unseen screen resolutions and layouts. Notably, GUI-Actor-7B even surpasses UI-TARS-72B (38.1) on ScreenSpot-Pro, achieving scores of 40.7 with Qwen2-VL and 44.6 with Qwen2.5-VL as backbones. Furthermore, by incorporating the verifier, we find that fine-tuning only the newly introduced action head (~100M parameters for 7B model) while keeping the VLM backbone frozen is sufficient to achieve performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art models, highlighting that GUI-Actor can endow the underlying VLM with effective grounding capabilities without compromising its general-purpose strengths.

Abstract: Neuroscience research publications encompass a vast wealth of knowledge. Accurately retrieving existing information and discovering new insights from this extensive literature is essential for advancing the field. However, when knowledge is dispersed across multiple sources, current state-of-the-art retrieval methods often struggle to extract the necessary information. A knowledge graph (KG) can integrate and link knowledge from multiple sources, but existing methods for constructing KGs in neuroscience often rely on labeled data and require domain expertise. Acquiring large-scale, labeled data for a specialized area like neuroscience presents significant challenges. This work proposes novel methods for constructing KG from unlabeled large-scale neuroscience research corpus utilizing large language models (LLM), neuroscience ontology, and text embeddings. We analyze the semantic relevance of neuroscience text segments identified by LLM for building the knowledge graph. We also introduce an entity-augmented information retrieval algorithm to extract knowledge from the KG. Several experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed approaches, and the results demonstrate that our methods significantly enhance knowledge discovery from the unlabeled neuroscience research corpus. It achieves an F1 score of 0.84 for entity extraction, and the knowledge obtained from the KG improves answers to over 54% of the questions.

Abstract: Although existing unified models achieve strong performance in vision-language understanding and text-to-image generation, they remain limited in addressing image perception and manipulation -- capabilities increasingly demanded in practical applications. Recently, OpenAI introduced the powerful GPT-4o-Image model, which showcases advanced capabilities in comprehensive image perception and manipulation, sparking widespread interest. Through carefully designed experiments, we observe that GPT-4o-Image likely relies on semantic encoders rather than VAEs for feature extraction, despite VAEs being commonly regarded as crucial for image manipulation tasks. Inspired by this insight, we propose UniWorld, a unified generative framework built upon semantic features extracted from powerful multimodal large language models and contrastive semantic encoders. Using only 2.7M training data, UniWorld achieves impressive performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, generation, manipulation, and perception. We fully open-source the UniWorld framework, including model weights, training and evaluation scripts, and datasets to promote reproducibility and further research.

<title>Causal Estimation of Tokenisation Bias</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03149</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Modern language models are typically trained over subword sequences, but ultimately define probabilities over character-strings. Ideally, the choice of the tokeniser -- which maps character-strings to subwords -- should not affect the probability assigned to the underlying character-string; in practice, it does. We define this mismatch as tokenisation bias. In this work, we quantify one particular type of tokenisation bias: the effect of including or not a subword (e.g., $\langle hello \rangle$) in a tokeniser's vocabulary on the probability a trained model assigns to the corresponding characters (i.e., \textit{``hello''}). Estimating this effect is challenging because each model is trained with only one tokeniser. We address this by framing tokenisation bias as a causal effect and estimating it using the regression discontinuity design. Specifically, we exploit the fact that tokenisation algorithms rank subwords and add the first $K$ to a tokeniser's vocabulary, where $K$ is an arbitrary cutoff point. As such, we can estimate a causal effect by comparing similar subwords around this cutoff. Experimentally, we find that tokenisation consistently affects models' outputs across scales, vocabularies, and tokenisers. Notably, a subword's presence in a small model's vocabulary may increase its characters' probability by up to 17 times, highlighting tokenisation as a key design choice in language modelling.

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models can generate high-quality and high-resolution video sequences from textual or image inputs, they lack explicit integration of geometric cues when controlling scene lighting and visual appearance across frames. To address this limitation, we propose IllumiCraft, an end-to-end diffusion framework accepting three complementary inputs: (1) high-dynamic-range (HDR) video maps for detailed lighting control; (2) synthetically relit frames with randomized illumination changes (optionally paired with a static background reference image) to provide appearance cues; and (3) 3D point tracks that capture precise 3D geometry information. By integrating the lighting, appearance, and geometry cues within a unified diffusion architecture, IllumiCraft generates temporally coherent videos aligned with user-defined prompts. It supports background-conditioned and text-conditioned video relighting and provides better fidelity than existing controllable video generation methods.

Abstract: Developing AI agents capable of interacting with open-world environments to solve diverse tasks is a compelling challenge. However, evaluating such open-ended agents remains difficult, with current benchmarks facing scalability limitations. To address this, we introduce Minecraft Universe (MCU), a comprehensive evaluation framework set within the open-world video game Minecraft. MCU incorporates three key components: (1) an expanding collection of 3,452 composable atomic tasks that encompasses 11 major categories and 41 subcategories of challenges; (2) a task composition mechanism capable of generating infinite diverse tasks with varying difficulty; and (3) a general evaluation framework that achieves 91.5\% alignment with human ratings for open-ended task assessment. Empirical results reveal that even state-of-the-art foundation agents struggle with the increasing diversity and complexity of tasks. These findings highlight the necessity of MCU as a robust benchmark to drive progress in AI agent development within open-ended environments. Our evaluation code and scripts are available at https://github.com/CraftJarvis/MCU.

Abstract: Social Media and Internet have the potential to be exploited as a source of opinion to enrich Decision Making solutions. Crowd Decision Making (CDM) is a methodology able to infer opinions and decisions from plain texts, such as reviews published in social media platforms, by means of Sentiment Analysis. Currently, the emergence and potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) lead us to explore new scenarios of automatically understand written texts, also known as natural language processing. This paper analyzes the use of ChatGPT based on prompt design strategies to assist in CDM processes to extract opinions and make decisions. We integrate ChatGPT in CDM processes as a flexible tool that infer the opinions expressed in texts, providing numerical or linguistic evaluations where the decision making models are based on the prompt design strategies. We include a multi-criteria decision making scenario with a category ontology for criteria. We also consider ChatGPT as an end-to-end CDM model able to provide a general opinion and score on the alternatives. We conduct empirical experiments on real data extracted from TripAdvisor, the TripR-2020Large dataset. The analysis of results show a promising branch for developing quality decision making models using ChatGPT. Finally, we discuss the challenges of consistency, sensitivity and explainability associated to the use of LLMs in CDM processes, raising open questions for future studies.

<title>Assurance of AI Systems From a Dependability Perspective</title>

Abstract: We outline the principles of classical assurance for computer-based systems that pose significant risks. We then consider application of these principles to systems that employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).
  A key element in this "dependability" perspective is a requirement for thorough understanding of the behavior of critical components, and this is considered infeasible for AI and ML. Hence the dependability perspective aims to minimize trust in AI and ML elements by using "defense in depth" with a hierarchy of less complex systems, some of which may be highly assured conventionally engineered components, to "guard" them. This may be contrasted with the "trustworthy" perspective that seeks to apply assurance to the AI and ML elements themselves.
  In cyber-physical and many other systems, it is difficult to provide guards that do not depend on AI and ML to perceive their environment (e.g., vehicles sharing the road with a self-driving car), so both perspectives are needed and there is a continuum or spectrum between them. We focus on architectures toward the dependability end of the continuum and invite others to consider additional points along the spectrum.
  For guards that require perception using AI and ML, we examine ways to minimize the trust placed in these elements; they include diversity, defense in depth, explanations, and micro-ODDs. We also examine methods to enforce acceptable behavior, given a model of the world. These include classical cyber-physical calculations and envelopes, and normative rules based on overarching principles, constitutions, ethics, or reputation.
  We apply our perspective to autonomous systems, AI systems for specific functions, general-purpose AI such as Large Language Models (LLMs), and Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), and we propose current best practice and conclude with a fourfold agenda for research.

Abstract: With the ever-increasing demands on Question Answering (QA) systems for IT operations and maintenance, an efficient and supervised fine-tunable framework is necessary to ensure the data security, private deployment and continuous upgrading. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have notably improved the open-domain QA's performance, how to efficiently handle enterprise-exclusive corpora and build domain-specific QA systems are still less-studied for industrial applications. In this paper, we propose a general and comprehensive framework based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and facilitate the whole business process of establishing QA systems for IT operations and maintenance. In accordance with the prevailing RAG method, our proposed framework, named with RAG4ITOps, composes of two major stages: (1) Models Fine-tuning \& Data Vectorization, and (2) Online QA System Process. At the Stage 1, we leverage a contrastive learning method with two negative sampling strategies to fine-tune the embedding model, and design the instruction templates to fine-tune the LLM with a Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning method. At the Stage 2, an efficient process of QA system is built for serving. We collect enterprise-exclusive corpora from the domain of cloud computing, and the extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior results than counterparts on two kinds of QA tasks. Our experiment also provide a case for applying the RAG4ITOps to real-world enterprise-level applications.

Abstract: Ensuring awareness of fairness and privacy in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical. Interestingly, we discover a counter-intuitive trade-off phenomenon that enhancing an LLM's privacy awareness through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods significantly decreases its fairness awareness with thousands of samples. To address this issue, inspired by the information theory, we introduce a training-free method to \textbf{S}uppress the \textbf{P}rivacy and fa\textbf{I}rness coupled \textbf{N}eurons (\textbf{SPIN}), which theoretically and empirically decrease the mutual information between fairness and privacy awareness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPIN eliminates the trade-off phenomenon and significantly improves LLMs' fairness and privacy awareness simultaneously without compromising general capabilities, \eg improving Qwen-2-7B-Instruct's fairness awareness by 12.2\% and privacy awareness by 14.0\%. More crucially, SPIN remains robust and effective with limited annotated data or even when only malicious fine-tuning data is available, whereas SFT methods may fail to perform properly in such scenarios. Furthermore, we show that SPIN could generalize to other potential trade-off dimensions. We hope this study provides valuable insights into concurrently addressing fairness and privacy concerns in LLMs and can be integrated into comprehensive frameworks to develop more ethical and responsible AI systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/ChnQ/SPIN.

Abstract: The rapid rise of AI has split model serving between open-weight distribution, which often lacks owner control and monetization, and opaque API-based approaches that risk user privacy and model transparency, forming a dichotomy that hinders an equitable AI ecosystem. This position paper introduces, rigorously formulates, and champions the Open-access, Monetizable, and Loyal (OML) paradigm for AI model serving: a foundational shift to securely distribute and serve AI models by synthesizing transparency with granular monetization and critical safety controls. We survey diverse OML constructions from theory and practice, analyze their security, performance, and practical trade-offs, outline a conceptual OML deployment protocol, and discuss market and policy implications. We assert that OML can foster a democratized, self-sustaining, and innovative AI landscape, mitigating centralized power risks. Finally, we call on the research community to further explore the broad design space of OML, spanning cryptographic, AI-native, and socio-economic mechanisms, to realize its full potential for a collaborative, accountable, and resilient AI future.

Abstract: A seminal paper published by Ledley and Lusted in 1959 introduced complex clinical diagnostic reasoning cases as the gold standard for the evaluation of expert medical computing systems, a standard that has held ever since. Here, we report the results of a physician evaluation of a large language model (LLM) on challenging clinical cases against a baseline of hundreds of physicians. We conduct five experiments to measure clinical reasoning across differential diagnosis generation, display of diagnostic reasoning, triage differential diagnosis, probabilistic reasoning, and management reasoning, all adjudicated by physician experts with validated psychometrics. We then report a real-world study comparing human expert and AI second opinions in randomly-selected patients in the emergency room of a major tertiary academic medical center in Boston, MA. We compared LLMs and board-certified physicians at three predefined diagnostic touchpoints: triage in the emergency room, initial evaluation by a physician, and admission to the hospital or intensive care unit. In all experiments--both vignettes and emergency room second opinions--the LLM displayed superhuman diagnostic and reasoning abilities, as well as continued improvement from prior generations of AI clinical decision support. Our study suggests that LLMs have achieved superhuman performance on general medical diagnostic and management reasoning, fulfilling the vision put forth by Ledley and Lusted, and motivating the urgent need for prospective trials.

Abstract: Auto-bidding is essential in facilitating online advertising by automatically placing bids on behalf of advertisers. Generative auto-bidding, which generates bids based on an adjustable condition using models like transformers and diffusers, has recently emerged as a new trend due to its potential to learn optimal strategies directly from data and adjust flexibly to preferences. However, generative models suffer from low-quality data leading to a mismatch between the condition, like return to go, and true action value, especially in long sequential decision-making. Besides, the majority preference in the dataset may hinder models' generalization ability on minority advertisers' preferences. While it is possible to collect high-quality data and retrain multiple models for different preferences, the high cost makes it unaffordable, hindering the advancement of auto-bidding into the era of large foundation models. To address this, we propose a flexible and practical Generative Auto-bidding scheme using post-training Search, termed GAS, to refine a base policy model's output and adapt to various preferences. We use weak-to-strong search alignment by training small critics for different preferences and an MCTS-inspired search to refine the model's output. Specifically, a novel voting mechanism with transformer-based critics trained with policy indications could enhance search alignment performance. Additionally, utilizing the search, we provide a fine-tuning method for high-frequency preference scenarios considering computational efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on the real-world dataset and online A/B test on the Kuaishou advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of GAS, achieving significant improvements, e.g., 4.60% increment of target cost.

Abstract: Language model pretraining with next token prediction has proved effective for scaling compute but is limited to the amount of available training data. Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities as zero-shot planners for embodied agents, their inability to learn from experience and build persistent mental models limits their robustness in complex open-world environments like Minecraft. We introduce MINDSTORES, an experience-augmented planning framework that enables embodied agents to build and leverage mental models through natural interaction with their environment. Drawing inspiration from how humans construct and refine cognitive mental models, our approach extends existing zero-shot LLM planning by maintaining a database of past experiences that informs future planning iterations. The key innovation is representing accumulated experiences as natural language embeddings of (state, task, plan, outcome) tuples, which can then be efficiently retrieved and reasoned over by an LLM planner to generate insights and guide plan refinement for novel states and tasks. Through extensive experiments in the MineDojo environment, a simulation environment for agents in Minecraft that provides low-level controls for Minecraft, we find that MINDSTORES learns and applies its knowledge significantly better than existing memory-based LLM planners while maintaining the flexibility and generalization benefits of zero-shot approaches, representing an important step toward more capable embodied AI systems that can learn continuously through natural experience.

Abstract: This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain. Our method is designed to align the generated content with user preferences while highlighting useful factual attributes. This agent consists of three key modules: (1) Grounding Module, mimicking expert human behavior to predict marketable features; (2) Personalization Module, aligning content with user preferences; (3) Marketing Module, ensuring factual accuracy and the inclusion of localized features. We conduct systematic human-subject experiments in the domain of real estate marketing, with a focus group of potential house buyers. The results demonstrate that marketing descriptions generated by our approach are preferred over those written by human experts by a clear margin while maintaining the same level of factual accuracy. Our findings suggest a promising agentic approach to automate large-scale targeted marketing while ensuring factuality of content generation.

<title>Fuzzy Speculative Decoding for a Tunable Accuracy-Runtime Tradeoff</title>

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) enforces strict distributional equivalence to the target model when accepting candidate tokens. While it maintains the target model's generation quality, this strict equivalence limits the speedup achievable by SD and prevents users from trading deviations from the target distribution in exchange for further inference speed gains. To address these limitations, we introduce Fuzzy Speculative Decoding (FSD) - a decoding algorithm that generalizes SD by accepting candidate tokens based on the divergences between the target and draft model distributions. By allowing for controlled divergence from the target model, FSD enables users to flexibly trade generation quality for inference speed. Across several benchmarks, our method is able to achieve significant runtime improvements of over 5 tokens per second faster than SD at only an approximate 2% absolute reduction in benchmark accuracy. In many cases, FSD is even able to match SD benchmark accuracy at over 2 tokens per second faster, demonstrating that distributional equivalence is not necessary to maintain target model performance. Furthermore, FSD can be seamlessly integrated into existing SD extensions; we demonstrate this by applying FSD to EAGLE-2, greatly enhancing this existing extension's efficiency while allowing it to leverage FSD's tunable quality-speed trade-off.

Abstract: Semantic interpretability in Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables transparency and verifiability by making the agent's decisions understandable and verifiable. Achieving this, however, requires a feature space composed of human-understandable concepts, which traditionally rely on human specification and may fail to generalize to unseen environments. We introduce interpretable Tree-based Reinforcement learning via Automated Concept Extraction (iTRACE), an automated framework that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLM) for semantic feature extraction and interpretable tree-based models for policy optimization. iTRACE first extracts semantically meaningful features, then maps them to policies via interpretable trees. To address the impracticality of running VLMs in RL loops, we distill their outputs into a lightweight model. By leveraging Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to automate tree-based reinforcement learning, iTRACE eliminates the need for human annotation traditionally required by interpretable models, while also addressing the limitations of VLMs alone, such as their lack of grounding in action spaces and inability to directly optimize policies. iTRACE outperforms MLP baselines that use the same interpretable features and matches the performance of CNN-based policies, producing verifiable, semantically interpretable, and human-aligned behaviors without requiring human annotation.

<title>DeCo: Defect-Aware Modeling with Contrasting Matching for Optimizing Task Assignment in Online IC Testing</title>

Abstract: In the semiconductor industry, integrated circuit (IC) processes play a vital role, as the rising complexity and market expectations necessitate improvements in yield. Identifying IC defects and assigning IC testing tasks to the right engineers improves efficiency and reduces losses. While current studies emphasize fault localization or defect classification, they overlook the integration of defect characteristics, historical failures, and the insights from engineer expertise, which restrains their effectiveness in improving IC handling. To leverage AI for these challenges, we propose DeCo, an innovative approach for optimizing task assignment in IC testing. DeCo constructs a novel defect-aware graph from IC testing reports, capturing co-failure relationships to enhance defect differentiation, even with scarce defect data. Additionally, it formulates defect-aware representations for engineers and tasks, reinforced by local and global structure modeling on the defect-aware graph. Finally, a contrasting-based assignment mechanism pairs testing tasks with QA engineers by considering their skill level and current workload, thus promoting an equitable and efficient job dispatch. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DeCo achieves the highest task-handling success rates in different scenarios, exceeding 80\%, while also maintaining balanced workloads on both scarce or expanded defect data. Moreover, case studies reveal that DeCo can assign tasks to potentially capable engineers, even for their unfamiliar defects, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven solution for the real-world IC failure analysis and task handling.

Abstract: Early detection of patient deterioration is crucial for reducing mortality rates. Heart rate data has shown promise in assessing patient health, and wearable devices offer a cost-effective solution for real-time monitoring. However, extracting meaningful insights from diverse heart rate data and handling missing values in wearable device data remain key challenges. To address these challenges, we propose TARL, an innovative approach that models the structural relationships of representative subsequences, known as shapelets, in heart rate time series. TARL creates a shapelet-transition knowledge graph to model shapelet dynamics in heart rate time series, indicating illness progression and potential future changes. We further introduce a transition-aware knowledge embedding to reinforce relationships among shapelets and quantify the impact of missing values, enabling the formulation of comprehensive heart rate representations. These representations capture explanatory structures and predict future heart rate trends, aiding early illness detection. We collaborate with physicians and nurses to gather ICU patient heart rate data from wearables and diagnostic metrics assessing illness severity for evaluating deterioration. Experiments on real-world ICU data demonstrate that TARL achieves both high reliability and early detection. A case study further showcases TARL's explainable detection process, highlighting its potential as an AI-driven tool to assist clinicians in recognizing early signs of patient deterioration.

Abstract: Current AI benchmarks miss the messy, multi-turn nature of human-AI collaboration. We present an evaluation framework that decomposes real-world tasks into interdependent subtasks, letting us track both LLM performance and users' strategies across a dialogue. Complementing this framework, we develop a suite of metrics, including a composite usage derived from semantic similarity, word overlap, and numerical matches; structural coherence; intra-turn diversity; and a novel measure of the "information frontier" reflecting the alignment between AI outputs and users' working knowledge. We demonstrate our methodology in a financial valuation task that mirrors real-world complexity. Our empirical findings reveal that while greater integration of LLM-generated content generally enhances output quality, its benefits are moderated by factors such as response incoherence, excessive subtask diversity, and the distance of provided information from users' existing knowledge. These results suggest that proactive dialogue strategies designed to inject novelty may inadvertently undermine task performance. Our work thus advances a more holistic evaluation of human-AI collaboration, offering both a robust methodological framework and actionable insights for developing more effective AI-augmented work processes.

Abstract: Dates often contribute towards highly impactful medical decisions, but it is rarely clear how to extract this data. AI has only just begun to be used transcribe such documents, and common methods are either to trust that the output produced by a complex AI model, or to parse the text using regular expressions. Recent work has established that regular expressions are an explainable form of logic, but it is difficult to decompose these into the component parts that are required to construct precise UNIX timestamps. First, we test publicly-available regular expressions, and we found that these were unable to capture a significant number of our dates. Next, we manually created easily-decomposable regular expressions, and we found that these were able to detect the majority of real dates, but also a lot of sequences of text that look like dates. Finally, we used regular expression synthesis to automatically identify regular expressions from the reverse-engineered UNIX timestamps that we created. We find that regular expressions created by regular expression synthesis detect far fewer sequences of text that look like dates than those that were manually created, at the cost of a slight increase to the number of missed dates. Overall, our results show that regular expressions can be created through regular expression synthesis to identify complex dates and date ranges in text transcriptions. To our knowledge, our proposed way of learning deterministic logic by reverse-engineering several many-one mappings and feeding these into a regular expression synthesiser is a new approach.

Abstract: The exponential rise in mobile device usage necessitates streamlined automation for effective task management, yet many AI frameworks fall short due to inadequate operational expertise. While manually written knowledge can bridge this gap, it is often burdensome and inefficient. We introduce Mobile-Agent-V, an innovative framework that utilizes video as a guiding tool to effortlessly and efficiently inject operational knowledge into mobile automation processes. By deriving knowledge directly from video content, Mobile-Agent-V eliminates manual intervention, significantly reducing the effort and time required for knowledge acquisition. To rigorously evaluate this approach, we propose Mobile-Knowledge, a benchmark tailored to assess the impact of external knowledge on mobile agent performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-V enhances performance by 36% compared to existing methods, underscoring its effortless and efficient advantages in mobile automation.

Abstract: Playing video games requires perception, memory, and planning, exactly the faculties modern large language model (LLM) agents are expected to master. We study the major challenges in using popular video games to evaluate modern LLMs and find that directly dropping LLMs into games cannot make an effective evaluation, for three reasons -- brittle vision perception, prompt sensitivity, and potential data contamination. We introduce lmgame-Bench to turn games into reliable evaluations. lmgame-Bench features a suite of platformer, puzzle, and narrative games delivered through a unified Gym-style API and paired with lightweight perception and memory scaffolds, and is designed to stabilize prompt variance and remove contamination. Across 13 leading models, we show lmgame-Bench is challenging while still separating models well. Correlation analysis shows that every game probes a unique blend of capabilities often tested in isolation elsewhere. More interestingly, performing reinforcement learning on a single game from lmgame-Bench transfers both to unseen games and to external planning tasks. Our evaluation code is available at https://github.com/lmgame-org/GamingAgent/lmgame-bench.

Abstract: We investigate how to teach large language models (LLMs) to perform scientific reasoning by leveraging expert discussions as a learning signal. Focusing on the genomics domain, we develop an automated pipeline to extract trainable data and introduce Genome-Bench, a new benchmark constructed from over a decade of scientific forum discussions on genome engineering. Our pipeline transforms raw interactions into a reinforcement learning-friendly multiple-choice questions format, supported by 3000+ high-quality question-answer pairs spanning foundational biology, experimental troubleshooting, tool usage, and beyond. We fine-tune an LLM using RL with a rule-based reward signal derived from the synthetic MCQ dataset to enhance domain-specific reasoning. Our results show that reinforcement learning from scientific discussions improves model performance by over 15% compared to the base model on Genome-Bench, narrowing the gap between open-source LLMs and expert-level reasoning. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end pipeline for teaching LLMs to reason from scientific discussions, with promising potential for generalization across scientific domains beyond biology.

<title>MAPLE: A Mobile Agent with Persistent Finite State Machines for Structured Task Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents aim to autonomously complete user-instructed tasks across mobile apps. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine (FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery, and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to 12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI agents during task execution. Moreover, our FSM representation can be integrated into future GUI agent architectures as a lightweight, model-agnostic memory layer to support structured planning, execution verification, and error recovery.

<title>Scene Structure Guidance Network: Unfolding Graph Partitioning into Pixel-Wise Feature Learning</title>

Abstract: Understanding the informative structures of scenes is essential for low-level vision tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain a concrete visual definition of the informative structures because influences of visual features are task-specific. In this paper, we propose a single general neural network architecture for extracting task-specific structure guidance for scenes. To do this, we first analyze traditional spectral clustering methods, which computes a set of eigenvectors to model a segmented graph forming small compact structures on image domains. We then unfold the traditional graph-partitioning problem into a learnable network, named \textit{Scene Structure Guidance Network (SSGNet)}, to represent the task-specific informative structures. The SSGNet yields a set of coefficients of eigenvectors that produces explicit feature representations of image structures. In addition, our SSGNet is light-weight ($\sim$ 56K parameters), and can be used as a plug-and-play module for off-the-shelf architectures. We optimize the SSGNet without any supervision by proposing two novel training losses that enforce task-specific scene structure generation during training. Our main contribution is to show that such a simple network can achieve state-of-the-art results for several low-level vision applications. We also demonstrate that our network generalizes well on unseen datasets, compared to existing methods which use structural embedding frameworks. We further propose a lighter version of SSGNet ($\sim$ 29K parameters) for depth computation, SSGNet-D, and successfully execute it on edge computing devices like Jetson AGX Orin, improving the performance of baseline network, even in the wild, with little computational delay.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) achieve scalability by dynamically activating subsets of their components. Yet, understanding how expertise emerges through joint training of gating mechanisms and experts remains incomplete, especially in scenarios without clear task partitions. Motivated by inference costs and data heterogeneity, we study how joint training of gating functions and experts can dynamically allocate domain-specific expertise across multiple underlying data distributions. As an outcome of our framework, we develop an instance tailored specifically to decentralized training scenarios, introducing \textit{Dynamically Decentralized Orchestration of MoEs} or \texttt{DDOME}. \texttt{DDOME} leverages heterogeneity emerging from distributional shifts across decentralized data sources to specialize experts dynamically. By integrating a pretrained common expert to inform a gating function, \texttt{DDOME} achieves personalized expert subset selection on-the-fly, facilitating just-in-time personalization. We empirically validate \texttt{DDOME} within a Federated Learning (FL) context: \texttt{DDOME} attains from 4\% up to an 24\% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art FL baselines in image and text classification tasks, while maintaining competitive zero-shot generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights confirming that the joint gating-experts training is critical for achieving meaningful expert specialization.

<title>Label Deconvolution for Node Representation Learning on Large-scale Attributed Graphs against Learning Bias</title>

Abstract: Node representation learning on attributed graphs -- whose nodes are associated with rich attributes (e.g., texts and protein sequences) -- plays a crucial role in many important downstream tasks. To encode the attributes and graph structures simultaneously, recent studies integrate pre-trained models with graph neural networks (GNNs), where pre-trained models serve as node encoders (NEs) to encode the attributes. As jointly training large NEs and GNNs on large-scale graphs suffers from severe scalability issues, many methods propose to train NEs and GNNs separately. Consequently, they do not take feature convolutions in GNNs into consideration in the training phase of NEs, leading to a significant learning bias relative to the joint training. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient label regularization technique, namely Label Deconvolution (LD), to alleviate the learning bias by a novel and highly scalable approximation to the inverse mapping of GNNs. The inverse mapping leads to an objective function that is equivalent to that by the joint training, while it can effectively incorporate GNNs in the training phase of NEs against the learning bias. More importantly, we show that LD converges to the optimal objective function values by the joint training under mild assumptions. Experiments demonstrate LD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on Open Graph Benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting is a critical challenge in various domains and has witnessed substantial progress in recent years. Many real-life scenarios, such as public health, economics, and social applications, involve feedback loops where predictions can influence the predicted outcome, subsequently altering the target variable's distribution. This phenomenon, known as performativity, introduces the potential for 'self-negating' or 'self-fulfilling' predictions. Despite extensive studies in classification problems across domains, performativity remains largely unexplored in the context of time-series forecasting from a machine-learning perspective.
  In this paper, we formalize performative time-series forecasting (PeTS), addressing the challenge of accurate predictions when performativity-induced distribution shifts are possible. We propose a novel approach, Feature Performative-Shifting (FPS), which leverages the concept of delayed response to anticipate distribution shifts and subsequently predicts targets accordingly. We provide theoretical insights suggesting that FPS can potentially lead to reduced generalization error. We conduct comprehensive experiments using multiple time-series models on COVID-19 and traffic forecasting tasks. The results demonstrate that FPS consistently outperforms conventional time-series forecasting methods, highlighting its efficacy in handling performativity-induced challenges.

arXiv:2311.18703v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents have no incentive to exhibit predictable behaviors, and are often pushed (through e.g. policy entropy regularisation) to randomise their actions in favor of exploration. This often makes it challenging for other agents and humans to predict an agent's behavior, triggering unsafe scenarios (e.g. in human-robot interaction). We propose a novel method to induce predictable behavior in RL agents, termed Predictability-Aware RL (PARL), employing the agent's trajectory entropy rate to quantify predictability. Our method maximizes a linear combination of a standard discounted reward and the negative entropy rate, thus trading off optimality with predictability. We show how the entropy rate can be formally cast as an average reward, how entropy-rate value functions can be estimated from a learned model and incorporate this in policy-gradient algorithms, and demonstrate how this approach produces predictable (near-optimal) policies in tasks inspired by human-robot use-cases.

Abstract: Recent large-scale T2I models like DALLE-3 have made progress in reducing gender stereotypes when generating single-person images. However, significant biases remain when generating images with more than one person. To systematically evaluate this, we propose the Paired Stereotype Test (PST) framework, which queries T2I models to depict two individuals assigned with male-stereotyped and female-stereotyped social identities, respectively (e.g. "a CEO" and "an Assistant"). This contrastive setting often triggers T2I models to generate gender-stereotyped images. Using PST, we evaluate two aspects of gender biases -- the well-known bias in gendered occupation and a novel aspect: bias in organizational power. Experiments show that over 74\% images generated by DALLE-3 display gender-occupational biases. Additionally, compared to single-person settings, DALLE-3 is more likely to perpetuate male-associated stereotypes under PST. We further propose FairCritic, a novel and interpretable framework that leverages an LLM-based critic model to i) detect bias in generated images, and ii) adaptively provide feedback to T2I models for improving fairness. FairCritic achieves near-perfect fairness on PST, overcoming the limitations of previous prompt-based intervention approaches.

Abstract: Humans efficiently generalize from limited demonstrations, but robots still struggle to transfer learned knowledge to complex, unseen tasks with longer horizons and increased complexity. We propose the first known method enabling robots to autonomously invent relational concepts directly from small sets of unannotated, unsegmented demonstrations. The learned symbolic concepts are grounded into logic-based world models, facilitating efficient zero-shot generalization to significantly more complex tasks. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to hand-crafted models, successfully scaling execution horizons and handling up to 18 times more objects than seen in training, providing the first autonomous framework for learning transferable symbolic abstractions from raw robot trajectories.

Abstract: The development and adoption of Vision Transformers and other deep-learning architectures for image classification tasks has been rapid. However, the "black box" nature of neural networks is a barrier to adoption in applications where explainability is essential. While some techniques for generating explanations have been proposed, primarily for Convolutional Neural Networks, adapting such techniques to the new paradigm of Vision Transformers is non-trivial. This paper presents T-TAME, Transformer-compatible Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations, a general methodology for explaining deep neural networks used in image classification tasks. The proposed architecture and training technique can be easily applied to any convolutional or Vision Transformer-like neural network, using a streamlined training approach. After training, explanation maps can be computed in a single forward pass; these explanation maps are comparable to or outperform the outputs of computationally expensive perturbation-based explainability techniques, achieving SOTA performance. We apply T-TAME to three popular deep learning classifier architectures, VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we demonstrate improvements over existing state-of-the-art explainability methods. A detailed analysis of the results and an ablation study provide insights into how the T-TAME design choices affect the quality of the generated explanation maps.

Abstract: In this paper, we present and study a new instance-level retrieval task: PointCloud-Text Matching (PTM), which aims to identify the exact cross-modal instance that matches a given point-cloud query or text query. PTM has potential applications in various scenarios, such as indoor/urban-canyon localization and scene retrieval. However, there is a lack of suitable and targeted datasets for PTM in practice. To address this issue, we present a new PTM benchmark dataset, namely SceneDepict-3D2T. We observe that the data poses significant challenges due to its inherent characteristics, such as the sparsity, noise, or disorder of point clouds and the ambiguity, vagueness, or incompleteness of texts, which render existing cross-modal matching methods ineffective for PTM. To overcome these challenges, we propose a PTM baseline, named Robust PointCloud-Text Matching method (RoMa). RoMa consists of two key modules: a Dual Attention Perception module (DAP) and a Robust Negative Contrastive Learning module (RNCL). Specifically, DAP leverages token-level and feature-level attention mechanisms to adaptively focus on useful local and global features, and aggregate them into common representations, thereby reducing the adverse impact of noise and ambiguity. To handle noisy correspondence, RNCL enhances robustness against mismatching by dividing negative pairs into clean and noisy subsets and assigning them forward and reverse optimization directions, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on our benchmarks and demonstrate the superiority of our RoMa.

However, when training from scratch on small datasets, there is still a significant performance gap between ViTs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which is attributed to the lack of inductive bias. To address this issue, we propose a Graph-based Vision Transformer (GvT) that utilizes graph convolutional projection and graph-pooling. In each block, queries and keys are calculated through graph convolutional projection based on the spatial adjacency matrix, while dot-product attention is used in another graph convolution to generate values. When using more attention heads, the queries and keys become lower-dimensional, making their dot product an uninformative matching function. To overcome this low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, we employ talking-heads technology based on bilinear pooled features and sparse selection of attention tensors. This allows interaction among filtered attention scores and enables each attention mechanism to depend on all queries and keys. Additionally, we apply graph-pooling between two intermediate blocks to reduce the number of tokens and aggregate semantic information more effectively. Our experimental results show that GvT produces comparable or superior outcomes to deep convolutional networks and surpasses vision transformers without pre-training on large datasets. The code for our proposed model is publicly available on the website.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that lead to generation of inappropriate or harmful content. Manual red-teaming requires a time-consuming search for adversarial prompts, whereas automatic adversarial prompt generation often leads to semantically meaningless attacks that do not scale well. In this paper, we present a novel method that uses another LLM, called AdvPrompter, to generate human-readable adversarial prompts in seconds. AdvPrompter, which is trained using an alternating optimization algorithm, generates suffixes that veil the input instruction without changing its meaning, such that the TargetLLM is lured to give a harmful response. Experimental results on popular open source TargetLLMs show highly competitive results on the AdvBench and HarmBench datasets, that also transfer to closed-source black-box LLMs. We also show that training on adversarial suffixes generated by AdvPrompter is a promising strategy for improving the robustness of LLMs to jailbreaking attacks.

Abstract: Self-correction is emerging as a promising approach to mitigate the issue of hallucination in Large Language Models (LLMs). To facilitate effective self-correction, recent research has proposed mistake detection as its initial step. However, current literature suggests that LLMs often struggle with reliably identifying reasoning mistakes when using simplistic prompting strategies. To address this challenge, we introduce a unique prompting strategy, termed the Pedagogical Chain-of-Thought (PedCoT), which is specifically designed to guide the identification of reasoning mistakes, particularly mathematical reasoning mistakes. PedCoT consists of pedagogical principles for prompts (PPP) design, two-stage interaction process (TIP) and grounded PedCoT prompts, all inspired by the educational theory of the Bloom Cognitive Model (BCM). We evaluate our approach on two public datasets featuring math problems of varying difficulty levels. The experiments demonstrate that our zero-shot prompting strategy significantly outperforms strong baselines. The proposed method can achieve the goal of reliable mathematical mistake identification and provide a foundation for automatic math answer grading. The results underscore the significance of educational theory, serving as domain knowledge, in guiding prompting strategy design for addressing challenging tasks with LLMs effectively.

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs) are deep probabilistic models that represent stochastic processes by conditioning their prior distributions on a set of context points. Despite their advantages in uncertainty estimation for complex distributions, NPs enforce parameterization coupling between the conditional prior model and the posterior model. We show that this coupling amounts to prior misspecification and revisit the NP objective to address this issue. More specifically, we propose R\'enyi Neural Processes (RNP), a method that replaces the standard KL divergence with the R\'enyi divergence, dampening the effects of the misspecified prior during posterior updates. We validate our approach across multiple benchmarks including regression and image inpainting tasks, and show significant performance improvements of RNPs in real-world problems. Our extensive experiments show consistently better log-likelihoods over state-of-the-art NP models.

Abstract: Teeth segmentation and recognition play a vital role in a variety of dental applications and diagnostic procedures. The integration of deep learning models has facilitated the development of precise and automated segmentation methods. Although prior research has explored teeth segmentation, not many methods have successfully performed tooth segmentation and detection simultaneously. This study presents UFBA-425, a dental dataset derived from the UFBA-UESC dataset, featuring bounding box and polygon annotations for 425 panoramic dental X-rays. Additionally, this work introduces OralBBNet, an architecture featuring distinct segmentation and detection heads as U-Net and YOLOv8, respectively. OralBBNet is designed to improve the accuracy and robustness of tooth classification and segmentation on panoramic X-rays by leveraging the complementary strengths of U-Net and YOLOv8. Our approach achieved a 1-3% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) for teeth detection compared to existing techniques and a 15-20% improvement in the dice score for teeth segmentation over U-Net over various tooth categories and 2-4% improvement in the dice score when compared with other segmentation architectures. The results of this study establish a foundation for the wider implementation of object detection models in dental diagnostics.

Abstract: A persistent challenge in sign language video processing, including the task of sign to written language translation, is how we learn representations of sign language in an effective and efficient way that preserves the important attributes of these languages, while remaining invariant to irrelevant visual differences. Informed by the nature and linguistics of signed languages, our proposed method focuses on just the most relevant parts in a signing video: the face, hands and body pose of the signer. However, instead of fully relying on pose estimation from off-the-shelf pose tracking models, which have inconsistent performance for hands and faces, we propose to learn a representation of the complex handshapes and facial expressions of sign languages in a self-supervised fashion. Our approach is based on learning from individual frames (rather than video sequences) and is therefore much more efficient than prior work on sign language pre-training. Compared to a recent model that established a new state of the art in sign language translation on the How2Sign dataset, our approach yields similar translation performance, using less than 3\% of the compute.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering (SE), with source code embeddings playing a crucial role in tasks such as source code clone detection and source code clustering. However, existing methods for source code embedding, including those based on LLMs, often rely on costly supervised training or fine-tuning for domain adaptation. This paper proposes a novel approach to embedding source code by combining large language and sentence embedding models. This approach attempts to eliminate the need for task-specific training or fine-tuning and to effectively address the issue of erroneous information commonly found in LLM-generated outputs. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted a series of experiments on three datasets with different programming languages by considering various LLMs and sentence embedding models. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, such as SourcererCC, Code2vec, InferCode, TransformCode, and LLM2Vec. Our findings highlight the potential of our approach to advance the field of SE by providing robust and efficient solutions for source code embedding tasks.

Abstract: The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.

Abstract: Robust, diverse, and challenging cultural knowledge benchmarks are essential for measuring our progress towards making LMs that are helpful across diverse cultures. We introduce CulturalBench: a set of 1,696 human-written and human-verified questions to assess LMs' cultural knowledge, covering 45 global regions including underrepresented ones like Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, and Peru. Questions are each verified by five independent annotators and span 17 diverse topics ranging from food preferences to greeting etiquette. We construct CulturalBench using methods inspired by Human-AI Red-Teaming. Compared to human performance (92.4% accuracy), the hard version of CulturalBench is challenging even for the best-performing frontier LMs, ranging from 28.7% to 61.5% in accuracy. We find that LMs often struggle with tricky questions that have multiple correct answers (e.g., What utensils do the Chinese usually use?), revealing a tendency to overfit to a single answer. Our results indicate that GPT-4o substantially outperform other models across cultures, besting local providers (e.g., Mistral on European culture and DeepSeek on Chinese culture). Across the board, models under-perform on questions related to North Africa, South America and Middle East.

Abstract: Text-based image generation models, such as Stable Diffusion and DALL-E 3, hold significant potential in content creation and publishing workflows, making them the focus in recent years. Despite their remarkable capability to generate diverse and vivid images, considerable efforts are being made to prevent the generation of harmful content, such as abusive, violent, or pornographic material. To assess the safety of existing models, we introduce a novel jailbreaking method called Chain-of-Jailbreak (CoJ) attack, which compromises image generation models through a step-by-step editing process. Specifically, for malicious queries that cannot bypass the safeguards with a single prompt, we intentionally decompose the query into multiple sub-queries. The image generation models are then prompted to generate and iteratively edit images based on these sub-queries. To evaluate the effectiveness of our CoJ attack method, we constructed a comprehensive dataset, CoJ-Bench, encompassing nine safety scenarios, three types of editing operations, and three editing elements. Experiments on four widely-used image generation services provided by GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 and Gemini 1.5 Pro, demonstrate that our CoJ attack method can successfully bypass the safeguards of models for over 60% cases, which significantly outperforms other jailbreaking methods (i.e., 14%). Further, to enhance these models' safety against our CoJ attack method, we also propose an effective prompting-based method, Think Twice Prompting, that can successfully defend over 95% of CoJ attack. We release our dataset and code to facilitate the AI safety research.

Abstract: Model heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HtFL). In scenarios with diverse model architectures, directly aggregating model parameters is impractical, leading HtFL methods to incorporate an extra objective alongside the original local objective on each client to facilitate collaboration. However, this often results in a mismatch between the extra and local objectives. To resolve this, we propose Federated Learning-to-Guide (FedL2G), a method that adaptively learns to guide local training in a federated manner, ensuring the added objective aligns with each client's original goal. With theoretical guarantees, FedL2G utilizes only first-order derivatives w.r.t. model parameters, achieving a non-convex convergence rate of O(1/T). We conduct extensive experiments across two data heterogeneity and six model heterogeneity settings, using 14 heterogeneous model architectures (e.g., CNNs and ViTs). The results show that FedL2G significantly outperforms seven state-of-the-art methods.

<title>HardNet: Hard-Constrained Neural Networks with Universal Approximation Guarantees</title>

Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has attracted significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and leads to conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction, especially on inputs far from the training distribution -- an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method with an efficient forward pass to enforce more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet is expressive and retains the universal approximation capabilities of neural networks. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of HardNet across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers with guaranteed feasibility, and optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Instruction-fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) under 14B parameters continue to underperform on natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, often trailing smaller models like BERT-base on benchmarks such as GLUE and SuperGLUE. Motivated by the success of reinforcement learning in reasoning tasks (e.g., DeepSeek), we explore Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a framework to improve the NLU capabilities of LLMs. We frame NLU as a reinforcement learning environment, treating token generation as a sequence of actions and optimizing for reward signals based on alignment with ground-truth labels. PPO consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning, yielding an average improvement of 6.3 points on GLUE, and surpasses zero-shot and few-shot prompting by 38.7 and 26.1 points, respectively. Notably, PPO-tuned models outperform GPT-4o by over 4\% on average across sentiment and natural language inference tasks, including gains of 7.3\% on the Mental Health dataset and 10.9\% on SIGA-nli. This work highlights a promising direction for adapting LLMs to new tasks by reframing them as reinforcement learning problems, enabling learning through simple end-task rewards rather than extensive data curation.

Abstract: Scaling laws predict the loss of a target machine learning model by extrapolating from easier-to-train models with fewer parameters or smaller training sets. This provides an efficient way for practitioners and researchers alike to compare pretraining decisions involving optimizers, datasets, and model architectures. Despite the widespread use of scaling laws to model the dynamics of language model training, there has been little work on understanding how to best estimate and interpret them. We collect (and release) a large-scale dataset containing losses and downstream evaluations for 485 previously published pretrained models. We use these to estimate more than 1000 scaling laws, then derive a set of best practices for estimating scaling laws in new model families. We find that fitting scaling laws to intermediate checkpoints of training runs (and not just their final losses) substantially improves accuracy, and that -- all else equal -- estimates of performance are generally most accurate when derived from other models of similar sizes. However, because there is a significant degree of variability across model seeds, training multiple small models is sometimes more useful than training a single large one. Moreover, while different model families differ scaling behavior, they are often similar enough that a target model's behavior can be predicted from a single model with the same architecture, along with scaling parameter estimates derived from other model families.

Abstract: A central goal of machine learning is generalization. While the No Free Lunch Theorem states that we cannot obtain theoretical guarantees for generalization without further assumptions, in practice we observe that simple models which explain the training data generalize best: a principle called Occam's razor. Despite the need for simple models, most current approaches in machine learning only minimize the training error, and at best indirectly promote simplicity through regularization or architecture design. Here, we draw a connection between Occam's razor and in-context learning: an emergent ability of certain sequence models like Transformers to learn at inference time from past observations in a sequence. In particular, we show that the next-token prediction loss used to train in-context learners is directly equivalent to a data compression technique called prequential coding, and that minimizing this loss amounts to jointly minimizing both the training error and the complexity of the model that was implicitly learned from context. Our theory and the empirical experiments we use to support it not only provide a normative account of in-context learning, but also elucidate the shortcomings of current in-context learning methods, suggesting ways in which they can be improved. We make our code available at https://github.com/3rdCore/PrequentialCode.

Abstract: Compositionality is believed to be fundamental to intelligence. In humans, it underlies the structure of thought, language, and higher-level reasoning. In AI, compositional representations can enable a powerful form of out-of-distribution generalization, in which a model systematically adapts to novel combinations of known concepts. However, while we have strong intuitions about what compositionality is, we lack satisfying formal definitions for it that are measurable and mathematical. Here, we propose such a definition, which we call representational compositionality, that accounts for and extends our intuitions about compositionality. The definition is conceptually simple, quantitative, grounded in algorithmic information theory, and applicable to any representation. Intuitively, representational compositionality states that a compositional representation satisfies three properties. First, it must be expressive. Second, it must be possible to re-describe the representation as a function of discrete symbolic sequences with re-combinable parts, analogous to sentences in natural language. Third, the function that relates these symbolic sequences to the representation, analogous to semantics in natural language, must be simple. Through experiments on both synthetic and real world data, we validate our definition of compositionality and show how it unifies disparate intuitions from across the literature in both AI and cognitive science. We also show that representational compositionality, while theoretically intractable, can be readily estimated using standard deep learning tools. We hope that our definition can inspire the design of novel, theoretically-driven models that better capture the mechanisms of compositional thought. We make our code available at https://github.com/EricElmoznino/complexity_compositionality.

<title>Beyond 2:4: exploring V:N:M sparsity for efficient transformer inference on GPUs</title>

Abstract: To date, 2:4 sparsity has stood as the only sparse pattern that can be accelerated using sparse tensor cores on GPUs. In practice, 2:4 sparsity often possesses low actual speedups ($\leq 1.3$) and requires fixed sparse ratios, meaning that other ratios, such as 4:8, 8:16, or those exceeding 50% sparsity, do not incur any speedups on GPUs. Recent studies suggest that V:N:M sparsity is promising in addressing these limitations of 2:4 sparsity. However, regarding accuracy, the effects of V:N:M sparsity on broader Transformer models, such as vision Transformers and large language models (LLMs), are largely unexamined. Moreover, Some specific issues related to V:N:M sparsity, such as how to select appropriate V and M values, remain unresolved. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the application of V:N:M sparsity in vision models and LLMs across multiple tasks, from pertaining to downstream tasks. We propose three key approaches to enhance the applicability and accuracy of V:N:M-sparse Transformers, including heuristic V and M selection, V:N:M-specific channel permutation, and three-staged LoRA training techniques. Experimental results show that, with our methods, the DeiT-small achieves lossless accuracy at 64:2:5 sparsity, while the DeiT-base maintains accuracy even at 64:2:8 sparsity. In addition, the fine-tuned LLama2-7B at 64:2:5 sparsity performs comparably or better than training-free 2:4 sparse alternatives on downstream tasks. More importantly, V:N:M-sparse Transformers offer a wider range of speedup-accuracy trade-offs compared to 2:4 sparsity. Overall, our exploration largely facilitates the V:N:M sparsity to act as a truly effective acceleration solution for Transformers in cost-sensitive inference scenarios.

Abstract: While post-training compression techniques effectively reduce the memory footprint, latency, and power consumption of Large Language Models (LLMs), they often result in noticeable accuracy degradation and remain limited by hardware and kernel constraints that restrict supported compression formats ultimately reducing flexibility across a wide range of deployment scenarios. In this work, we propose EoRA, a novel fine-tuning-free method that augments compressed LLMs with low-rank matrices, allowing users to rapidly enhance task-specific performance and freely balance the trade-off between accuracy and computational overhead beyond the constraints of compression formats. EoRA consistently outperforms prior training-free low rank methods in recovering the accuracy of compressed LLMs, achieving notable accuracy improvements (e.g., $\mathbf{10.84\%}$ on ARC-Challenge, $\mathbf{6.74\%}$ on MathQA, and $\mathbf{6.74\%}$ on GSM8K) for LLaMA3-8B compressed to 3-bit. We also introduce an optimized CUDA kernel, accelerating inference by up to 1.4x and reducing memory overhead through quantizing EoRA. Overall, EoRA offers a prompt solution for improving the accuracy of compressed models under varying user requirements, enabling more efficient and flexible deployment of LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/EoRA.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a crucial technique for aligning language models with human preferences, playing a pivotal role in the success of conversational models like GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Llama 2. A core challenge in employing RLHF lies in training a reliable reward model (RM), which relies on high-quality labels typically provided by human experts or advanced AI system. These methods can be costly and may introduce biases that affect the language model's responses. As language models improve, human input may become less effective in further enhancing their performance. In this paper, we propose Self-Evolved Reward Learning (SER), a novel approach where the RM generates additional training data to iteratively improve itself. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple datasets such as HH-RLHF and UltraFeedback, using models like Mistral and Llama 3, and compare SER against various baselines. Our results demonstrate that even with limited human-annotated data, learning from self-feedback can robustly enhance RM performance, thereby boosting the capabilities of large language models (LLMs).

Abstract: Multimodal conversation, a crucial form of human communication, carries rich emotional content, making the exploration of the causes of emotions within it a research endeavor of significant importance. However, existing research on the causes of emotions typically employs an utterance selection method within a single textual modality to locate causal utterances. This approach remains limited to coarse-grained assessments, lacks nuanced explanations of emotional causation, and demonstrates inadequate capability in identifying multimodal emotional triggers. Therefore, we introduce a task-\textbf{Multimodal Emotion Cause Explanation in Conversation (MECEC)}. This task aims to generate a summary based on the multimodal context of conversations, clearly and intuitively describing the reasons that trigger a given emotion. To adapt to this task, we develop a new dataset (ECEM) based on the MELD dataset. ECEM combines video clips with detailed explanations of character emotions, helping to explore the causal factors behind emotional expression in multimodal conversations. A novel approach, FAME-Net, is further proposed, that harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze visual data and accurately interpret the emotions conveyed through facial expressions in videos. By exploiting the contagion effect of facial emotions, FAME-Net effectively captures the emotional causes of individuals engaged in conversations. Our experimental results on the newly constructed dataset show that FAME-Net outperforms several excellent baselines. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/3222345200/FAME-Net.

<title>SuffixDecoding: Extreme Speculative Decoding for Emerging AI Applications</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely adopted to reduce latency in large language model (LLM) inference by leveraging smaller draft models capable of handling diverse user tasks. However, emerging AI applications, such as LLM-based agents, present unique workload characteristics: instead of diverse independent requests, agentic frameworks typically submit repetitive inference requests, such as multi-agent pipelines performing similar subtasks or self-refinement loops iteratively enhancing outputs. These workloads result in long and highly predictable sequences, which current speculative decoding methods do not effectively exploit. To address this gap, we introduce \emph{SuffixDecoding}, a novel method that utilizes efficient suffix trees to cache long token sequences from prompts and previous outputs. By adaptively speculating more tokens when acceptance likelihood is high and fewer when it is low, SuffixDecoding effectively exploits opportunities for longer speculations while conserving computation when those opportunities are limited. Evaluations on agentic benchmarks, including SWE-Bench and Text-to-SQL, demonstrate that SuffixDecoding achieves speedups of up to 5.3$\times$, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- 2.8$\times$ faster than model-based approaches like EAGLE-2/3 and 1.9$\times$ faster than model-free approaches such as Token Recycling. SuffixDecoding is open-sourced at https://github.com/snowflakedb/ArcticInference.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have seen significant performance improvements in recent years. However, due to their size and complexity, they function as black-boxes, leading to transparency concerns. State-of-the-art saliency methods generate local explanations that highlight the area in the input image where a class is identified but cannot explain how a concept of interest contributes to the prediction, which is essential for bias mitigation. On the other hand, concept-based methods, such as TCAV (Testing with Concept Activation Vectors), provide insights into how sensitive is the network to a concept, but cannot compute its attribution in a specific prediction nor show its location within the input image. This paper introduces a novel post-hoc explainability framework, Visual-TCAV, which aims to bridge the gap between these methods by providing both local and global explanations for CNN-based image classification. Visual-TCAV uses Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) to generate saliency maps that show where concepts are recognized by the network. Moreover, it can estimate the attribution of these concepts to the output of any class using a generalization of Integrated Gradients. This framework is evaluated on popular CNN architectures, with its validity further confirmed via experiments where ground truth for explanations is known, and a comparison with TCAV. Our code is available at https://github.com/DataSciencePolimi/Visual-TCAV.

Abstract: We present a diffusion-based approach to quadrupedal locomotion that simultaneously addresses the limitations of learning and interpolating between multiple skills and of (modes) offline adapting to new locomotion behaviours after training. This is the first framework to apply classifier-free guided diffusion to quadruped locomotion and demonstrate its efficacy by extracting goal-conditioned behaviour from an originally unlabelled dataset. We show that these capabilities are compatible with a multi-skill policy and can be applied with little modification and minimal compute overhead, i.e., running entirely on the robots onboard CPU. We verify the validity of our approach with hardware experiments on the ANYmal quadruped platform.

We also demonstrate that the learned model is capable of accurate path integration.

Abstract: While the Web has become a global platform for communication, malicious actors, including hackers and hacktivist groups, often disseminate ideological content and coordinate activities through the "Dark Web", an obscure counterpart of the conventional web. Presently, challenges such as information overload and the fragmented nature of cyber threat data impede comprehensive profiling of these actors, thereby limiting the efficacy of predictive analyses of their online activities. Concurrently, the proliferation of internet-connected devices has surpassed the global human population, with this disparity projected to widen as the Internet of Things (IoT) expands. Technical communities are actively advancing IoT-related research to address its growing societal integration. This paper proposes a novel predictive threat intelligence framework designed to systematically collect, analyze, and visualize Dark Web data to identify malicious websites and correlate this information with potential IoT vulnerabilities. The methodology integrates automated data harvesting, analytical techniques, and visual mapping tools, while also examining vulnerabilities in IoT devices to assess exploitability. By bridging gaps in cybersecurity research, this study aims to enhance predictive threat modeling and inform policy development, thereby contributing to intelligence research initiatives focused on mitigating cyber risks in an increasingly interconnected digital ecosystem.

arXiv:2412.07820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal prompt selection is crucial for maximizing large language model (LLM) performance on downstream tasks, especially in black-box settings where models are only accessible via APIs. Black-box prompt selection is challenging due to potentially large, combinatorial search spaces, absence of gradient information, and high evaluation cost of prompts on a validation set. We propose HbBoPs, a novel method that combines a structural-aware deep kernel Gaussian Process with Hyperband as a multi-fidelity scheduler to efficiently select prompts. HbBoPs uses embeddings of instructions and few-shot exemplars, treating them as modular components within prompts. This enhances the surrogate model's ability to predict which prompt to evaluate next in a sample-efficient manner. Hyperband improves query-efficiency by adaptively allocating resources across different fidelity levels, reducing the number of validation instances required for evaluating prompts. Extensive experiments across ten diverse benchmarks and three LLMs demonstrate that HbBoPs outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both performance and efficiency.

<title>SATA: A Paradigm for LLM Jailbreak via Simple Assistive Task Linkage</title>

arXiv:2412.15289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across various tasks, but their safety alignment remain a major concern. Exploring jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs' vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords. Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.

<title>HybGRAG: Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases</title>

Abstract: Given a semi-structured knowledge base (SKB), where text documents are interconnected by relations, how can we effectively retrieve relevant information to answer user questions? Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves documents to assist large language models (LLMs) in question answering; while Graph RAG (GRAG) uses structured knowledge bases as its knowledge source. However, many questions require both textual and relational information from SKB - referred to as "hybrid" questions - which complicates the retrieval process and underscores the need for a hybrid retrieval method that leverages both information. In this paper, through our empirical analysis, we identify key insights that show why existing methods may struggle with hybrid question answering (HQA) over SKB. Based on these insights, we propose HybGRAG for HQA consisting of a retriever bank and a critic module, with the following advantages: (1) Agentic, it automatically refines the output by incorporating feedback from the critic module, (2) Adaptive, it solves hybrid questions requiring both textual and relational information with the retriever bank, (3) Interpretable, it justifies decision making with intuitive refinement path, and (4) Effective, it surpasses all baselines on HQA benchmarks. In experiments on the STaRK benchmark, HybGRAG achieves significant performance gains, with an average relative improvement in Hit@1 of 51%.

Abstract: Self-evolving trainin--where models iteratively learn from their own outputs--has emerged as a key approach for complex reasoning tasks, addressing the scarcity of high-quality chain-of-thought data. However, its effectiveness in multimodal reasoning, a domain more intricate than text-only reasoning, remains underexplored, and the understanding of critical factors in this training paradigm remains limited. Furthermore, a central challenge for this training method is performance saturation, which impedes further improvements and scalability. Inspired by reinforcement learning (RL), in this paper, we reframe self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning through the lens of RL, identifying three pivotal factors: Training Method, Reward Model, and Prompt Variation. Through systematic analysis, we establish relatively optimal design principles that significantly enhance multimodal reasoning capabilities. Moreover, delving deeper into training dynamics, we uncover the roots of saturation and propose a new automatic balancing mechanism to mitigate this limitation. Building on these insights, we propose M-STAR (Multimodal Self-evolving Training for Reasoning), a framework that achieves consistent performance gains across models of varying sizes and diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose Exemplar-Condensed federated class-incremental learning (ECoral) to distil the training characteristics of real images from streaming data into informative rehearsal exemplars. The proposed method eliminates the limitations of exemplar selection in replay-based approaches for mitigating catastrophic forgetting in federated continual learning (FCL). The limitations particularly related to the heterogeneity of information density of each summarized data. Our approach maintains the consistency of training gradients and the relationship to past tasks for the summarized exemplars to represent the streaming data compared to the original images effectively. Additionally, our approach reduces the information-level heterogeneity of the summarized data by inter-client sharing of the disentanglement generative model. Extensive experiments show that our ECoral outperforms several state-of-the-art methods and can be seamlessly integrated with many existing approaches to enhance performance.

Abstract: Graph generation is a critical task in numerous domains, including molecular design and social network analysis, due to its ability to model complex relationships and structured data. While most modern graph generative models utilize adjacency matrix representations, this work revisits an alternative approach that represents graphs as sequences of node set and edge set. We advocate for this approach due to its efficient encoding of graphs and propose a novel representation. Based on this representation, we introduce the Graph Generative Pre-trained Transformer (G2PT), an auto-regressive model that learns graph structures via next-token prediction. To further exploit G2PT's capabilities as a general-purpose foundation model, we explore fine-tuning strategies for two downstream applications: goal-oriented generation and graph property prediction. We conduct extensive experiments across multiple datasets. Results indicate that G2PT achieves superior generative performance on both generic graph and molecule datasets. Furthermore, G2PT exhibits strong adaptability and versatility in downstream tasks from molecular design to property prediction. Code available at https://github.com/tufts-ml/G2PT,

arXiv:2501.06645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient preference optimization algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have become a popular approach in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. These algorithms implicitly treat the LLM as a reward model, and focus on training it to correct misranked preference pairs. However, recent work~\citep{chen2024preference} empirically finds that DPO training \textit{rarely improves these misranked preference pairs}, despite its gradient emphasizing on these cases. We introduce FocalPO, a DPO variant that instead \textit{down-weighs} misranked preference pairs and prioritizes enhancing the model's understanding of pairs that it can already rank correctly. Inspired by Focal Loss used in vision tasks, FocalPO achieves this by adding a modulating factor to dynamically scale DPO loss. Our experiment demonstrates that FocalPO surpasses DPO and its variants on popular benchmarks like Alpaca Eval 2.0 using Mistral-Base-7B and Llama-3-Instruct-8B, with the introduced hyperparameter fixed. Additionally, we empirically reveals how FocalPO affects training on correct and incorrect sample groups, further underscoring its effectiveness.

<title>The Invisible Hand: Unveiling Provider Bias in Large Language Models for Code Generation</title>

arXiv:2501.07849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, surpassing traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation. In this paper, we reveal a novel provider bias in LLMs: without explicit directives, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). To systematically investigate this bias, we develop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in computational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests. Such a bias holds far-reaching implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially contributing to digital monopolies. It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. We call on the academic community to recognize this emerging issue and develop effective evaluation and mitigation methods to uphold AI security and fairness.

<title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Switching Rewards and History Dependency for Characterizing Animal Behaviors</title>

arXiv:2501.12633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional approaches to studying decision-making in neuroscience focus on simplified behavioral tasks where animals perform repetitive, stereotyped actions to receive explicit rewards. While informative, these methods constrain our understanding of decision-making to short timescale behaviors driven by explicit goals. In natural environments, animals exhibit more complex, long-term behaviors driven by intrinsic motivations that are often unobservable. Recent works in time-varying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aim to capture shifting motivations in long-term, freely moving behaviors. However, a crucial challenge remains: animals make decisions based on their history, not just their current state. To address this, we introduce SWIRL (SWitching IRL), a novel framework that extends traditional IRL by incorporating time-varying, history-dependent reward functions. SWIRL models long behavioral sequences as transitions between short-term decision-making processes, each governed by a unique reward function. SWIRL incorporates biologically plausible history dependency to capture how past decisions and environmental contexts shape behavior, offering a more accurate description of animal decision-making. We apply SWIRL to simulated and real-world animal behavior datasets and show that it outperforms models lacking history dependency, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This work presents the first IRL model to incorporate history-dependent policies and rewards to advance our understanding of complex, naturalistic decision-making in animals.

Abstract: While Large Language Models require more and more data to train and scale, rather than looking for any data to acquire, we should consider what types of tasks are more likely to benefit from data scaling. We should be intentional in our data acquisition. We argue that the shape of the data itself, such as its compositional and structural patterns, informs which tasks to prioritize in data scaling, and shapes the development of the next generation of compute paradigms for tasks where data scaling is inefficient, or even insufficient.

arXiv:2501.15781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new finetuning method to provide pre-trained large language models (LMs) the ability to scale test-time compute through the diffusion framework. By increasing the number of diffusion steps, we show our finetuned models achieve monotonically increasing accuracy, directly translating to improved performance across downstream tasks. Furthermore, our finetuned models can expertly answer questions on specific topics by integrating powerful guidance techniques, and autonomously determine the compute required for a given problem by leveraging adaptive ODE solvers. Our method is universally applicable to any foundation model pre-trained with a cross-entropy loss and does not modify any of its original weights, fully preserving its strong single-step generation capabilities. We show our method is more effective and fully compatible with traditional finetuning approaches, introducing an orthogonal new direction to unify the strengths of the autoregressive and diffusion frameworks.

<title>CAND: Cross-Domain Ambiguity Inference for Early Detecting Nuanced Illness Deterioration</title>

arXiv:2501.16365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early detection of patient deterioration is essential for timely treatment, with vital signs like heart rates being key health indicators. Existing methods tend to solely analyze vital sign waveforms, ignoring transition relationships of waveforms within each vital sign and the correlation strengths among various vital signs. Such studies often overlook nuanced illness deterioration, which is the early sign of worsening health but is difficult to detect. In this paper, we introduce CAND, a novel method that organizes the transition relationships and the correlations within and among vital signs as domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge. CAND jointly models these knowledge in a unified representation space, considerably enhancing the early detection of nuanced illness deterioration. In addition, CAND integrates a Bayesian inference method that utilizes augmented knowledge from domain-specific and cross-domain knowledge to address the ambiguities in correlation strengths. With this architecture, the correlation strengths can be effectively inferred to guide joint modeling and enhance representations of vital signs. This allows a more holistic and accurate interpretation of patient health. Our experiments on a real-world ICU dataset demonstrate that CAND significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and earliness in detecting nuanced illness deterioration. Moreover, we conduct a case study for the interpretable detection process to showcase the practicality of CAND.

Abstract: The adoption of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in critical fields where predictions need to be accompanied by justifications is hindered by their inherent black-box nature. In this paper, we introduce P-TAME (Perturbation-based Trainable Attention Mechanism for Explanations), a model-agnostic method for explaining DNN-based image classifiers. P-TAME employs an auxiliary image classifier to extract features from the input image, bypassing the need to tailor the explanation method to the internal architecture of the backbone classifier being explained. Unlike traditional perturbation-based methods, which have high computational requirements, P-TAME offers an efficient alternative by generating high-resolution explanations in a single forward pass during inference. We apply P-TAME to explain the decisions of VGG-16, ResNet-50, and ViT-B-16, three distinct and widely used image classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our method matches or outperforms previous explainability methods, including model-specific approaches. Code and trained models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used tool for dimension reduction and denoising. Therefore, it is also widely used on the data prior to training a neural network. However, this approach can complicate the explanation of explainable AI (XAI) methods for the decision of the model. In this work, we analyze the potential issues with this approach and propose Principal Components-based Initialization (PCsInit), a strategy to incorporate PCA into the first layer of a neural network via initialization of the first layer in the network with the principal components, and its two variants PCsInit-Act and PCsInit-Sub. Explanations using these strategies are as direct and straightforward as for neural networks and are simpler than using PCA prior to training a neural network on the principal components. Moreover, as will be illustrated in the experiments, such training strategies can also allow further improvement of training via backpropagation.

<title>Understanding Federated Learning from IID to Non-IID dataset: An Experimental Study</title>

arXiv:2502.00182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As privacy concerns and data regulations grow, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for training machine learning models across decentralized data sources without sharing raw data. However, a significant challenge in FL is that client data are often non-IID (non-independent and identically distributed), leading to reduced performance compared to centralized learning. While many methods have been proposed to address this issue, their underlying mechanisms are often viewed from different perspectives. Through a comprehensive investigation from gradient descent to FL, and from IID to non-IID data settings, we find that inconsistencies in client loss landscapes primarily cause performance degradation in non-IID scenarios. From this understanding, we observe that existing methods can be grouped into two main strategies: (i) adjusting parameter update paths and (ii) modifying client loss landscapes. These findings offer a clear perspective on addressing non-IID challenges in FL and help guide future research in the field.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in solving complex reasoning tasks, particularly in mathematics. However, the domain of physics reasoning presents unique challenges that have received significantly less attention. Existing benchmarks often fall short in evaluating LLMs' abilities on the breadth and depth of undergraduate-level physics, underscoring the need for a comprehensive evaluation. To fill this gap, we introduce UGPhysics, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate UnderGraduate-level Physics (UGPhysics) reasoning with LLMs. UGPhysics includes 5,520 undergraduate-level physics problems in both English and Chinese, covering 13 subjects with seven different answer types and four distinct physics reasoning skills, all rigorously screened for data leakage. Additionally, we develop a Model-Assistant Rule-based Judgment (MARJ) pipeline specifically tailored for assessing answer correctness of physics problems, ensuring accurate evaluation. Our evaluation of 31 leading LLMs shows that the highest overall accuracy, 49.8% (achieved by OpenAI-o1-mini), emphasizes the necessity for models with stronger physics reasoning skills, beyond math abilities. We hope UGPhysics, along with MARJ, will drive future advancements in AI for physics reasoning. Codes and data are available at https://github.com/YangLabHKUST/UGPhysics .

Abstract: Many commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) are often closed-source, limiting developers to prompt tuning for aligning content generation with specific applications. While these models currently do not provide access to token logits, we argue that if such access were available, it would enable more powerful adaptation techniques beyond prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose a token-level probability reweighting framework that, given access to logits and a small amount of task-specific data, can effectively steer black-box LLMs toward application-specific content generation. Our approach views next-token prediction through the lens of supervised classification. We show that aligning black-box LLMs with task-specific data can be formulated as a label noise correction problem, leading to Plugin model -- an autoregressive probability reweighting model that operates solely on logits. We provide theoretical justification for why reweighting logits alone is sufficient for task adaptation. Extensive experiments with multiple datasets, LLMs, and reweighting models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, advocating for broader access to token logits in closed-source models.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) for solving question-answer (QA) tasks. The state-of-the-art RAG approaches often use the graph data as the external data since they capture the rich semantic information and link relationships between entities. However, existing graph-based RAG approaches cannot accurately identify the relevant information from the graph and also consume large numbers of tokens in the online retrieval process. To address these issues, we introduce a novel graph-based RAG approach, called Attributed Community-based Hierarchical RAG (ArchRAG), by augmenting the question using attributed communities, and also introducing a novel LLM-based hierarchical clustering method. To retrieve the most relevant information from the graph for the question, we build a novel hierarchical index structure for the attributed communities and develop an effective online retrieval method. Experimental results demonstrate that ArchRAG outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and token cost. Moreover, ArchRAG has been successfully applied to domain knowledge QA in Huawei Cloud Computing.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language processing tasks, such as text generation and semantic understanding. However, their performance on numerical reasoning tasks, such as basic arithmetic, numerical retrieval, and magnitude comparison, remains surprisingly poor. This gap arises from their reliance on surface-level statistical patterns rather than understanding numbers as continuous magnitudes. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on either linguistic competence or structured mathematical problem-solving, neglecting fundamental numerical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose NumericBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate six fundamental numerical capabilities: number recognition, arithmetic operations, contextual retrieval, comparison, summary, and logical reasoning. NumericBench includes datasets ranging from synthetic number lists to the crawled real-world data, addressing challenges like long contexts, noise, and multi-step reasoning. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4 and DeepSeek, reveal persistent weaknesses in numerical reasoning, highlighting the urgent need to improve numerically-aware language modeling. The benchmark is released in: https://github.com/TreeAI-Lab/NumericBench.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have expanded the capabilities of traditional language models by enabling interaction through both text and images. However, ensuring the safety of these models remains a significant challenge, particularly in accurately identifying whether multimodal content is safe or unsafe-a capability we term safety awareness. In this paper, we introduce MMSafeAware, the first comprehensive multimodal safety awareness benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across 29 safety scenarios with 1500 carefully curated image-prompt pairs. MMSafeAware includes both unsafe and over-safety subsets to assess models abilities to correctly identify unsafe content and avoid over-sensitivity that can hinder helpfulness. Evaluating nine widely used MLLMs using MMSafeAware reveals that current models are not sufficiently safe and often overly sensitive; for example, GPT-4V misclassifies 36.1% of unsafe inputs as safe and 59.9% of benign inputs as unsafe. We further explore three methods to improve safety awareness-prompting-based approaches, visual contrastive decoding, and vision-centric reasoning fine-tuning-but find that none achieve satisfactory performance. Our findings highlight the profound challenges in developing MLLMs with robust safety awareness, underscoring the need for further research in this area. All the code and data will be publicly available to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, such as the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), have become increasingly popular, offering promising avenues for employing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices to address challenging combinatorial optimization tasks like the maximum cut problem. In this study, we utilize an evolutionary algorithm equipped with a unique fitness function. This approach targets hard maximum cut instances within the latent space of a Graph Autoencoder, identifying those that pose significant challenges or are particularly tractable for RQAOA, in contrast to the classic Goemans and Williamson algorithm. Our findings not only delineate the distinct capabilities and limitations of each algorithm but also expand our understanding of RQAOA's operational limits. Furthermore, the diverse set of graphs we have generated serves as a crucial benchmarking asset, emphasizing the need for more advanced algorithms to tackle combinatorial optimization challenges. Additionally, our results pave the way for new avenues in graph generation research, offering exciting opportunities for future explorations.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have become increasingly prevalent across various real-world applications. They enhance decision-making by storing private user-agent interactions in the memory module for demonstrations, introducing new privacy risks for LLM agents. In this work, we systematically investigate the vulnerability of LLM agents to our proposed Memory EXTRaction Attack (MEXTRA) under a black-box setting. To extract private information from memory, we propose an effective attacking prompt design and an automated prompt generation method based on different levels of knowledge about the LLM agent. Experiments on two representative agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MEXTRA. Moreover, we explore key factors influencing memory leakage from both the agent designer's and the attacker's perspectives. Our findings highlight the urgent need for effective memory safeguards in LLM agent design and deployment.

<title>Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization: Aligning Vision-Language Models with Minimal Contrastive Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.13928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) tend to neglect image content and over-rely on language-model priors, resulting in errors in visually grounded tasks and hallucinations. We hypothesize that this issue arises because existing VLMs are not explicitly trained to generate texts that are accurately grounded in fine-grained image details. To enhance visual feedback during VLM training, we propose S-VCO (Symmetrical Visual Contrastive Optimization), a novel finetuning objective that steers the model toward capturing important visual details and aligning them with corresponding text tokens. To further facilitate this detailed alignment, we introduce MVC, a paired image-text dataset built by automatically filtering and augmenting visual counterfactual data to challenge the model with hard contrastive cases involving Minimal Visual Contrasts. Experiments show that our method consistently improves VLM performance across diverse benchmarks covering various abilities and domains, achieving up to a 22% reduction in hallucinations, and significant gains in vision-centric and general tasks. Notably, these improvements become increasingly pronounced in benchmarks with higher visual dependency. In short, S-VCO offers a significant enhancement of VLM's visually-dependent task performance while retaining or even improving the model's general abilities. We opensource our code at https://s-vco.github.io/

Abstract: Medical images are acquired at high resolutions with large fields of view in order to capture fine-grained features necessary for clinical decision-making. Consequently, training deep learning models on medical images can incur large computational costs. In this work, we address the challenge of downsizing medical images in order to improve downstream computational efficiency while preserving clinically-relevant features. We introduce MedVAE, a family of six large-scale 2D and 3D autoencoders capable of encoding medical images as downsized latent representations and decoding latent representations back to high-resolution images. We train MedVAE autoencoders using a novel two-stage training approach with 1,052,730 medical images. Across diverse tasks obtained from 20 medical image datasets, we demonstrate that (1) utilizing MedVAE latent representations in place of high-resolution images when training downstream models can lead to efficiency benefits (up to 70x improvement in throughput) while simultaneously preserving clinically-relevant features and (2) MedVAE can decode latent representations back to high-resolution images with high fidelity. Our work demonstrates that large-scale, generalizable autoencoders can help address critical efficiency challenges in the medical domain. Our code is available at https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAE.

<title>A Mousetrap: Fooling Large Reasoning Models for Jailbreak with Chain of Iterative Chaos</title>

arXiv:2502.15806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, Claude-Sonnet and Gemini-Thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench, attacking Claude-Sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively. Attention: This paper contains inappropriate, offensive and harmful content.

Abstract: Understanding information from visually rich documents remains a significant challenge for traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods. Existing benchmarks predominantly focus on image-based question answering (QA), overlooking the fundamental challenges of efficient retrieval, comprehension, and reasoning within dense visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce ViDoSeek, a novel dataset designed to evaluate RAG performance on visually rich documents requiring complex reasoning. Based on it, we identify key limitations in current RAG approaches: (i) purely visual retrieval methods struggle to effectively integrate both textual and visual features, and (ii) previous approaches often allocate insufficient reasoning tokens, limiting their effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose ViDoRAG, a novel multi-agent RAG framework tailored for complex reasoning across visual documents. ViDoRAG employs a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based hybrid strategy to effectively handle multi-modal retrieval. To further elicit the model's reasoning capabilities, we introduce an iterative agent workflow incorporating exploration, summarization, and reflection, providing a framework for investigating test-time scaling in RAG domains. Extensive experiments on ViDoSeek validate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. Notably, ViDoRAG outperforms existing methods by over 10% on the competitive ViDoSeek benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/ViDoRAG.

Abstract: Scaling quantum computing to practical applications necessitates reliable quantum error correction. Although numerous correction codes have been proposed, the overall correction efficiency critically limited by the decode algorithms. We introduce GraphQEC, a code-agnostic decoder leveraging machine-learning on the graph structure of stabilizer codes with linear time complexity. GraphQEC demonstrates unprecedented accuracy and efficiency across all tested code families, including surface codes, color codes, and quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. For instance, on a distance-12 QLDPC code, GraphQEC achieves a logical error rate of $9.55 \times 10^{-5}$, an 18-fold improvement over the previous best specialized decoder's $1.74 \times 10^{-3}$ under $p=0.005$ physical error rates, while maintaining $157\mu$s/cycle decoding speed. Our approach represents the first universal solution for real-time quantum error correction across arbitrary stabilizer codes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been observed to process non-human-readable text sequences, such as jailbreak prompts, often viewed as a bug for aligned LLMs. In this work, we present a systematic investigation challenging this perception, demonstrating that unnatural languages - strings that appear incomprehensible to humans but maintain semantic meanings for LLMs - contain latent features usable by models. Notably, unnatural languages possess latent features that can be generalized across different models and tasks during inference. Furthermore, models fine-tuned on unnatural versions of instruction datasets perform on-par with those trained on natural language, achieving 49.71 win rates in Length-controlled AlpacaEval 2.0 in average across various base models. In addition, through comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs process unnatural languages by filtering noise and inferring contextual meaning from filtered words.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising generative capabilities across diverse domains, yet aligning their outputs with desired reward functions remains a challenge, particularly in cases where reward functions are non-differentiable. Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in slow thinking reasoning models have shown exceptional performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, these models often exhibit overthinking (generating redundant reasoning steps for simple problems), leading to excessive computational resource usage. While current mitigation strategies uniformly reduce reasoning tokens, they risk degrading performance on challenging tasks that require extended reasoning. This paper introduces Difficulty-Adaptive Slow Thinking (DAST), a novel framework that enables models to autonomously adjust the length of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) based on problem difficulty. We first propose a Token Length Budget (TLB) metric to quantify difficulty, then leverage budget-aware reward shaping and budget preference optimization to implement DAST. DAST penalizes overlong responses for simple tasks while incentivizing sufficient reasoning for complex problems. Experiments on diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that DAST effectively mitigates overthinking (reducing token usage by over 30\% on average) while preserving reasoning accuracy on complex problems.

arXiv:2503.05306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning is based on pre-collected preference feedback over pairs of trajectories. While offline PbRL has demonstrated remarkable empirical success, existing theoretical approaches face challenges in ensuring conservatism under uncertainty, requiring computationally intractable confidence set constructions. We address this limitation by proposing Adversarial Preference-based Policy Optimization (APPO), a computationally efficient algorithm for offline PbRL that guarantees sample complexity bounds without relying on explicit confidence sets. By framing PbRL as a two-player game between a policy and a model, our approach enforces conservatism in a tractable manner. Using standard assumptions on function approximation and bounded trajectory concentrability, we derive a sample complexity bound. To our knowledge, APPO is the first offline PbRL algorithm to offer both statistical efficiency and practical applicability. Experimental results on continuous control tasks demonstrate that APPO effectively learns from complex datasets, showing comparable performance with existing state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Political Neutrality in AI Is Impossible- But Here Is How to Approximate It</title>

Abstract: AI systems often exhibit political bias, influencing users' opinions and decisions. While political neutrality-defined as the absence of bias-is often seen as an ideal solution for fairness and safety, this position paper argues that true political neutrality is neither feasible nor universally desirable due to its subjective nature and the biases inherent in AI training data, algorithms, and user interactions. However, inspired by Joseph Raz's philosophical insight that "neutrality [...] can be a matter of degree" (Raz, 1986), we argue that striving for some neutrality remains essential for promoting balanced AI interactions and mitigating user manipulation. Therefore, we use the term "approximation" of political neutrality to shift the focus from unattainable absolutes to achievable, practical proxies. We propose eight techniques for approximating neutrality across three levels of conceptualizing AI, examining their trade-offs and implementation strategies. In addition, we explore two concrete applications of these approximations to illustrate their practicality. Finally, we assess our framework on current large language models (LLMs) at the output level, providing a demonstration of how it can be evaluated. This work seeks to advance nuanced discussions of political neutrality in AI and promote the development of responsible, aligned language models.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing, aligning them with human preferences remains an open challenge. Although current alignment methods rely primarily on explicit feedback, eye-tracking (ET) data offers insights into real-time cognitive processing during reading. In this paper, we present OASST-ETC, a novel eye-tracking corpus capturing reading patterns from 24 participants, while evaluating LLM-generated responses from the OASST1 dataset. Our analysis reveals distinct reading patterns between preferred and non-preferred responses, which we compare with synthetic eye-tracking data. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human reading measures and attention patterns from various transformer-based models, discovering stronger correlations in preferred responses. This work introduces a unique resource for studying human cognitive processing in LLM evaluation and suggests promising directions for incorporating eye-tracking data into alignment methods. The dataset and analysis code are publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated enhanced reasoning capabilities, evolving from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to advanced, product-oriented solutions like OpenAI o1. During our re-implementation of this model, we noticed that in multimodal tasks requiring visual input (e.g., geometry problems), Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) struggle to maintain focus on the visual information, in other words, MLLMs suffer from a gradual decline in attention to visual information as reasoning progresses, causing text-over-relied outputs. To investigate this, we ablate image inputs during long-chain reasoning. Concretely, we truncate the reasoning process midway, then re-complete the reasoning process with the input image removed. We observe only a ~2% accuracy drop on MathVista's test-hard subset, revealing the model's textual outputs dominate the following reasoning process. Motivated by this, we propose Take-along Visual Conditioning (TVC), a strategy that shifts image input to critical reasoning stages and compresses redundant visual tokens via dynamic pruning. This methodology helps the model retain attention to the visual components throughout the reasoning. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks (+3.4 points vs previous sota), demonstrating the effectiveness of TVC in enhancing multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: AI-generated images have become so good in recent years that individuals often cannot distinguish them any more from "real" images. This development, combined with the rapid spread of AI-generated content online, creates a series of societal risks, particularly with the emergence of "deep fakes" that impersonate real individuals. Watermarking, a technique that involves embedding information within images and other content to indicate their AI-generated nature, has emerged as a primary mechanism to address the risks posed by AI-generated content. Indeed, watermarking and AI labelling measures are now becoming a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, including under the 2024 European Union AI Act. Despite the widespread use of AI image generation systems, the current status of the implementation of such measures remains largely unexamined. Moreover, the practical implications of the AI Act's watermarking and labelling requirements have not previously been studied. The present paper therefore both provides an empirical analysis of 50 widely used AI systems for image generation, embedded into a legal analysis of the AI Act. In our legal analysis, we identify four categories of generative AI image deployment scenarios relevant under the AI Act and outline how the legal obligations apply in each category. In our empirical analysis, we find that only a minority number of AI image generators currently implement adequate watermarking (38%) and deep fake labelling (8%) practices. In response, we suggest a range of avenues of how the implementation of these legally mandated techniques can be improved, and publicly share our tooling for the easy detection of watermarks in images.

Abstract: This paper studies continual test-time adaptation (CTTA), the task of adapting a model to constantly changing unseen domains in testing while preserving previously learned knowledge. Existing CTTA methods mostly focus on adaptation to the current test domain only, overlooking generalization to arbitrary test domains a model may face in the future. To tackle this limitation, we present a novel online test-time domain generalization framework for CTTA, dubbed TestDG. TestDG aims to learn features invariant to both current and previous test domains on the fly during testing, improving the potential for effective generalization to future domains. To this end, we propose a new model architecture and a test-time adaptation strategy dedicated to learning domain-invariant features, along with a new data structure and optimization algorithm for effectively managing information from previous test domains. TestDG achieved state of the art on four public CTTA benchmarks. Moreover, it showed superior generalization to unseen test domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are foundational explorations to artificial general intelligence, yet their alignment with human values via instruction tuning and preference learning achieves only superficial compliance. Here, we demonstrate that harmful knowledge embedded during pretraining persists as indelible "dark patterns" in LLMs' parametric memory, evading alignment safeguards and resurfacing under adversarial inducement at distributional shifts. In this study, we first theoretically analyze the intrinsic ethical vulnerability of aligned LLMs by proving that current alignment methods yield only local "safety regions" in the knowledge manifold. In contrast, pretrained knowledge remains globally connected to harmful concepts via high-likelihood adversarial trajectories. Building on this theoretical insight, we empirically validate our findings by employing semantic coherence inducement under distributional shifts--a method that systematically bypasses alignment constraints through optimized adversarial prompts. This combined theoretical and empirical approach achieves a 100% attack success rate across 19 out of 23 state-of-the-art aligned LLMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and LLaMA-3, revealing their universal vulnerabilities.

<title>Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424</link>

Abstract: Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.

Abstract: Using entropic inequalities from information theory, we provide new bounds on the total variation and 2-Wasserstein distances between a conditionally Gaussian law and a Gaussian law with invertible covariance matrix. We apply our results to quantify the speed of convergence to Gaussian of a randomly initialized fully connected neural network and its derivatives - evaluated in a finite number of inputs - when the initialization is Gaussian and the sizes of the inner layers diverge to infinity. Our results require mild assumptions on the activation function, and allow one to recover optimal rates of convergence in a variety of distances, thus improving and extending the findings of Basteri and Trevisan (2023), Favaro et al. (2023), Trevisan (2024) and Apollonio et al. (2024). One of our main tools are the quantitative cumulant estimates established in Hanin (2024). As an illustration, we apply our results to bound the total variation distance between the Bayesian posterior law of the neural network and its derivatives, and the posterior law of the corresponding Gaussian limit: this yields quantitative versions of a posterior CLT by Hron et al. (2022), and extends several estimates by Trevisan (2024) to the total variation metric.

Abstract: Multimodal data are often incomplete and exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics in real-world scenarios. These inherent limitations lead to both modality heterogeneity through partial modality absence and data heterogeneity from distribution divergence, creating fundamental challenges for effective federated learning (FL). To address these coupled challenges, we propose FedRecon, the first method targeting simultaneous missing modality reconstruction and Non-IID adaptation in multimodal FL. Our approach first employs a lightweight Multimodal Variational Autoencoder (MVAE) to reconstruct missing modalities while preserving cross-modal consistency. Distinct from conventional imputation methods, we achieve sample-level alignment through a novel distribution mapping mechanism that guarantees both data consistency and completeness. Additionally, we introduce a strategy employing global generator freezing to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which in turn mitigates Non-IID fluctuations. Extensive evaluations on multimodal datasets demonstrate FedRecon's superior performance in modality reconstruction under Non-IID conditions, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The rapid growth of unlabeled time-series data in domains such as wireless communications, radar, biomedical engineering, and the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven advancements in unsupervised learning. This review synthesizes recent progress in applying autoencoders and vision transformers for unsupervised signal analysis, focusing on their architectures, applications, and emerging trends. We explore how these models enable feature extraction, anomaly detection, and classification across diverse signal types, including electrocardiograms, radar waveforms, and IoT sensor data. The review highlights the strengths of hybrid architectures and self-supervised learning, while identifying challenges in interpretability, scalability, and domain generalization. By bridging methodological innovations and practical applications, this work offers a roadmap for developing robust, adaptive models for signal intelligence.

Abstract: The use of chatbots equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) in educational settings has increased in recent years, showing potential to support teaching and learning. However, the adoption of these technologies has raised concerns about their impact on academic integrity, students' ability to problem-solve independently, and potential underlying biases. To better understand students' perspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a large public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262 undergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks of AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.
  The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with feedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information being the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic integrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the potential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data privacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements in education.
  While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks of AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between human and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is flagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can establish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI literacy. With these in place, practitioners can effectively develop and implement educational systems that leverage AI's potential in areas such as immediate feedback and personalized learning support. This approach can enhance the quality of students' educational experiences while preserving the integrity of the learning process with AI.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts. Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs' safety mechanisms and generates high-risk content, providing insights into jailbreak attack risks and contributing to stronger defense strategies.

Abstract: Online fine-tuning vision-language model (VLM) agents with reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise for equipping agents with multi-step, goal-oriented capabilities in dynamic environments. However, their open-ended textual action space and non-end-to-end nature of action generation present significant challenges to effective online exploration in RL, e.g., explosion of the exploration space. We propose a novel online fine-tuning method, Counterfactual Soft Reinforcement Learning (CoSo), better suited to the textual output space of VLM agents. Compared to prior methods that assign uniform uncertainty to all tokens, CoSo leverages counterfactual reasoning to dynamically assess the causal influence of individual tokens on post-processed actions. By prioritizing the exploration of action-critical tokens while reducing the impact of semantically redundant or low-impact tokens, CoSo enables a more targeted and efficient online rollout process. We provide theoretical analysis proving CoSo's convergence and policy improvement guarantees, and extensive empirical evaluations supporting CoSo's effectiveness. Our results across a diverse set of agent tasks, including Android device control, card gaming, and embodied AI, highlight its remarkable ability to enhance exploration efficiency and deliver consistent performance gains. The code is available at https://github.com/langfengQ/CoSo.

Abstract: Generating high-quality 3D models from 2D sketches is a challenging task due to the inherent ambiguity and sparsity of sketch data. In this paper, we present S3D, a novel framework that converts simple hand-drawn sketches into detailed 3D models. Our method utilizes a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture to convert sketches into face segmentation masks, which are then used to generate a 3D representation that can be rendered from novel views. To ensure robust consistency between the sketch domain and the 3D output, we introduce a novel style-alignment loss that aligns the U-Net bottleneck features with the initial encoder outputs of the 3D generation module, significantly enhancing reconstruction fidelity. To further enhance the network's robustness, we apply augmentation techniques to the sketch dataset. This streamlined framework demonstrates the effectiveness of S3D in generating high-quality 3D models from sketch inputs. The source code for this project is publicly available at https://github.com/hailsong/S3D.

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of deep neural network (DNN) models, dynamic watermarking techniques are being used to protect the intellectual property of model owners. However, recent studies have shown that existing watermarking schemes are vulnerable to watermark removal and ambiguity attacks. Besides, the vague criteria for determining watermark presence further increase the likelihood of such attacks. In this paper, we propose a secure DNN watermarking scheme named ChainMarks, which generates secure and robust watermarks by introducing a cryptographic chain into the trigger inputs and utilizes a two-phase Monte Carlo method for determining watermark presence. First, ChainMarks generates trigger inputs as a watermark dataset by repeatedly applying a hash function over a secret key, where the target labels associated with trigger inputs are generated from the digital signature of model owner. Then, the watermarked model is produced by training a DNN over both the original and watermark datasets. To verify watermarks, we compare the predicted labels of trigger inputs with the target labels and determine ownership with a more accurate decision threshold that considers the classification probability of specific models. Experimental results show that ChainMarks exhibits higher levels of robustness and security compared to state-of-the-art watermarking schemes. With a better marginal utility, ChainMarks provides a higher probability guarantee of watermark presence in DNN models with the same level of watermark accuracy.

<title>A Scaling Law for Token Efficiency in LLM Fine-Tuning Under Fixed Compute Budgets</title>

arXiv:2505.06150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a scaling law for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) under fixed compute budgets that explicitly accounts for data composition. Conventional approaches measure training data solely by total tokens, yet the number of examples and their average token length -- what we term \emph{dataset volume} -- play a decisive role in model performance. Our formulation is tuned following established procedures. Experiments on the BRICC dataset \cite{salavati2024reducing} and subsets of the MMLU dataset \cite{hendrycks2021measuringmassivemultitasklanguage}, evaluated under multiple subsampling strategies, reveal that data composition significantly affects token efficiency. These results motivate refined scaling laws for practical LLM fine-tuning in resource-constrained settings.

arXiv:2505.06262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Dialz, a framework for advancing research on steering vectors for open-source LLMs, implemented in Python. Steering vectors allow users to modify activations at inference time to amplify or weaken a 'concept', e.g. honesty or positivity, providing a more powerful alternative to prompting or fine-tuning. Dialz supports a diverse set of tasks, including creating contrastive pair datasets, computing and applying steering vectors, and visualizations. Unlike existing libraries, Dialz emphasizes modularity and usability, enabling both rapid prototyping and in-depth analysis. We demonstrate how Dialz can be used to reduce harmful outputs such as stereotypes, while also providing insights into model behaviour across different layers. We release Dialz with full documentation, tutorials, and support for popular open-source models to encourage further research in safe and controllable language generation. Dialz enables faster research cycles and facilitates insights into model interpretability, paving the way for safer, more transparent, and more reliable AI systems.

Abstract: Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \textbf{T}ime series Noisy \textbf{L}abel \textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels.

Abstract: Generative models have shown great promise as trajectory planners, given their affinity to modeling complex distributions and guidable inference process. Previous works have successfully applied these in the context of robotic manipulation but perform poorly when the required solution does not exist as a complete trajectory within the training set. We identify that this is a result of being unable to plan via stitching, and subsequently address the architectural and dataset choices needed to remedy this. On top of this, we propose a novel addition to the training and inference procedures to both stabilize and enhance these capabilities. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating plans with out of distribution boundary conditions and performing obstacle avoidance on the Franka Panda in simulation and on real hardware. In both of these tasks our method performs significantly better than the baselines and is able to avoid obstacles up to four times as large.

In this KDD 2025 tutorial, we present a comprehensive exploration of FMware that combines a curated catalogue of challenges with real-world production concerns. We first discuss the state of research and practice in building FMware. We further examine the difficulties in selecting suitable models, aligning high-quality domain-specific data, engineering robust prompts, and orchestrating autonomous agents. We then address the complex journey from impressive demos to production-ready systems by outlining issues in system testing, optimization, deployment, and integration with legacy software. Drawing on our industrial experience and recent research in the area, we provide actionable insights and a technology roadmap for overcoming these challenges. Attendees will gain practical strategies to enable the creation of trustworthy FMware in the evolving technology landscape.

Abstract: Classification is a common AI problem, and vector search is a typical solution. This transforms a given body of text into a numerical representation, known as an embedding, and modern improvements to vector search focus on optimising speed and predictive accuracy. This is often achieved through neural methods that aim to learn language semantics. However, our results suggest that these are not always the best solution. Our task was to classify rigidly-structured medical documents according to their content, and we found that using off-the-shelf semantic vector search produced slightly worse predictive accuracy than creating a bespoke lexical vector search model, and that it required significantly more time to execute. These findings suggest that traditional methods deserve to be contenders in the information retrieval toolkit, despite the prevalence and success of neural models.

Abstract: Current speech-LLMs exhibit limited capability in contextual reasoning alongside paralinguistic understanding, primarily due to the lack of Question-Answer (QA) datasets that cover both aspects. We propose a novel framework for dataset generation from in-the-wild speech data, that integrates contextual reasoning with paralinguistic information. It consists of a pseudo paralinguistic label-based data condensation of in-the-wild speech and LLM-based Contextual Paralinguistic QA (CPQA) generation. The effectiveness is validated by a strong correlation in evaluations of the Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct model on a dataset created by our framework and human-generated CPQA dataset. The results also reveal the speech-LLM's limitations in handling empathetic reasoning tasks, highlighting the need for such datasets and more robust models. The proposed framework is first of its kind and has potential in training more robust speech-LLMs with paralinguistic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization, particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce \textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter) LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL) curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system. This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1, on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered, progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench}, a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, particularly in video generation, has led to unprecedented creative capabilities but also increased threats to information integrity, identity security, and public trust. Existing detection methods, while effective in general scenarios, lack robust solutions for human-centric videos, which pose greater risks due to their realism and potential for legal and ethical misuse. Moreover, current detection approaches often suffer from poor generalization, limited scalability, and reliance on labor-intensive supervised fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, the first interpretable MLLM-based framework for detecting human-centric fake videos, enhanced via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through our carefully designed accuracy detection reward and temporal compensation reward, it effectively avoids the use of high-cost text annotation data, enabling precise temporal modeling and forgery detection. Meanwhile, we design a dual-encoder architecture, combining high-level semantic reasoning and low-level artifact amplification to guide MLLMs in effective forgery detection. We further collect FakeHumanVid, a large-scale human-centric video benchmark that includes synthesis methods guided by pose, audio, and text inputs, enabling rigorous evaluation of detection methods in real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that AvatarShield significantly outperforms existing approaches in both in-domain and cross-domain detection, setting a new standard for human-centric video forensics.

Abstract: Modern autoregressive speech synthesis models leveraging language models have demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the sequential nature of next token prediction in these models leads to significant latency, hindering their deployment in scenarios where inference speed is critical. In this work, we propose Speech Speculative Decoding (SSD), a novel framework for autoregressive speech synthesis acceleration. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight draft model to generate candidate token sequences, which are subsequently verified in parallel by the target model using the proposed SSD framework. Experimental results demonstrate that SSD achieves a significant speedup of 1.4x compared with conventional autoregressive decoding, while maintaining high fidelity and naturalness. Subjective evaluations further validate the effectiveness of SSD in preserving the perceptual quality of the target model while accelerating inference.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient quantification of cardiac function is essential for the estimation of prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). One of the most commonly used metrics for evaluating cardiac pumping performance is left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). However, LVEF can be affected by factors such as inter-observer variability and varying pre-load and after-load conditions, which can reduce its reproducibility. Additionally, cardiac dysfunction may not always manifest as alterations in LVEF, such as in heart failure and cardiotoxicity diseases. An alternative measure that can provide a relatively load-independent quantitative assessment of myocardial contractility is myocardial strain and strain rate. By using LVEF in combination with myocardial strain, it is possible to obtain a thorough description of cardiac function. Automated estimation of LVEF and other volumetric measures from cine-MRI sequences can be achieved through segmentation models, while strain calculation requires the estimation of tissue displacement between sequential frames, which can be accomplished using registration models. These tasks are often performed separately, potentially limiting the assessment of cardiac function. To address this issue, in this study we propose an end-to-end deep learning (DL) model that jointly estimates groupwise (GW) registration and segmentation for cardiac cine-MRI images. The proposed anatomically-guided Deep GW network was trained and validated on a large dataset of 4-chamber view cine-MRI image series of 374 subjects. A quantitative comparison with conventional GW registration using elastix and two DL-based methods showed that the proposed model improved performance and substantially reduced computation time.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenges in intelligent processing of Chinese ancient mathematical classics by constructing Guji_MATH, a benchmark for evaluating classical texts based on Suanjing Shishu. It systematically assesses the mathematical problem-solving capabilities of mainstream reasoning models under the unique linguistic constraints of classical Chinese. Through machine-assisted annotation and manual verification, 538 mathematical problems were extracted from 8 canonical texts, forming a structured dataset centered on the "Question-Answer-Solution" framework, supplemented by problem types and difficulty levels. Dual evaluation modes--closed-book (autonomous problem-solving) and open-book (reproducing classical solution methods)--were designed to evaluate the performance of six reasoning models on ancient Chinese mathematical problems. Results indicate that reasoning models can partially comprehend and solve these problems, yet their overall performance remains inferior to benchmarks on modern mathematical tasks. Enhancing models' classical Chinese comprehension and cultural knowledge should be prioritized for optimization. This study provides methodological support for mining mathematical knowledge from ancient texts and disseminating traditional culture, while offering new perspectives for evaluating cross-linguistic and cross-cultural capabilities of reasoning models.

<title>The Polar Express: Optimal Matrix Sign Methods and Their Application to the Muon Algorithm</title>

Abstract: Computing the polar decomposition and the related matrix sign function, has been a well-studied problem in numerical analysis for decades. More recently, it has emerged as an important subroutine in deep learning, particularly within the Muon optimization framework. However, the requirements in this setting differ significantly from those of traditional numerical analysis. In deep learning, methods must be highly efficient and GPU-compatible, but high accuracy is often unnecessary. As a result, classical algorithms like Newton-Schulz (which suffers from slow initial convergence) and methods based on rational functions (which rely on QR decompositions or matrix inverses) are poorly suited to this context. In this work, we introduce Polar Express, a GPU-friendly algorithm for computing the polar decomposition. Like classical polynomial methods such as Newton-Schulz, our approach uses only matrix-matrix multiplications, making it GPU-compatible. Motivated by earlier work of Chen & Chow and Nakatsukasa & Freund, Polar Express adapts the polynomial update rule at each iteration by solving a minimax optimization problem, and we prove that it enjoys a strong worst-case optimality guarantee. This property ensures both rapid early convergence and fast asymptotic convergence. We also address finite-precision issues, making it stable in bfloat16 in practice. We apply Polar Express within the Muon optimization framework and show consistent improvements in validation loss on large-scale models such as GPT-2, outperforming recent alternatives across a range of learning rates.

Abstract: High-quality long-context instruction data is essential for aligning long-context large language models (LLMs). Despite the public release of models like Qwen and Llama, their long-context instruction data remains proprietary. Human annotation is costly and challenging, while template-based synthesis methods limit scale, diversity, and quality. We introduce LongMagpie, a self-synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale long-context instruction data. Our key insight is that aligned long-context LLMs, when presented with a document followed by special tokens preceding a user turn, auto-regressively generate contextually relevant queries. By harvesting these document-query pairs and the model's responses, LongMagpie produces high-quality instructions without human effort. Experiments on HELMET, RULER, and Longbench v2 demonstrate that LongMagpie achieves leading performance on long-context tasks while maintaining competitive performance on short-context tasks, establishing it as a simple and effective approach for open, diverse, and scalable long-context instruction data synthesis.

Abstract: Smishing, or SMS-based phishing, poses an increasing threat to mobile users by mimicking legitimate communications through culturally adapted, concise, and deceptive messages, which can result in the loss of sensitive data or financial resources. In such, we present a multi-channel smishing detection model that combines country-specific semantic tagging, structural pattern tagging, character-level stylistic cues, and contextual phrase embeddings. We curated and relabeled over 84,000 messages across five datasets, including 24,086 smishing samples. Our unified architecture achieves 97.89% accuracy, an F1 score of 0.963, and an AUC of 99.73%, outperforming single-stream models by capturing diverse linguistic and structural cues. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-signal learning in robust and region-aware phishing.

arXiv:2505.18499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress, their proficiency in graph-related tasks remains notably limited, hindering the development of truly general-purpose models. Previous attempts, including pretraining graph foundation models or employing supervised fine-tuning, often face challenges such as the scarcity of large-scale, universally represented graph data. We introduce G1, a simple yet effective approach demonstrating that Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic graph-theoretic tasks can significantly scale LLMs' graph reasoning abilities. To enable RL training, we curate Erd\~os, the largest graph reasoning dataset to date comprising 50 diverse graph-theoretic tasks of varying difficulty levels, 100k training data and 5k test data, all drived from real-world graphs. With RL on Erd\~os, G1 obtains substantial improvements in graph reasoning, where our finetuned 3B model even outperforms Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct (24x size). RL-trained models also show strong zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks, domains, and graph encoding schemes, including other graph-theoretic benchmarks as well as real-world node classification and link prediction tasks, without compromising general reasoning abilities. Our findings offer an efficient, scalable path for building strong graph reasoners by finetuning LLMs with RL on graph-theoretic tasks, which combines the strengths of pretrained LLM capabilities with abundant, automatically generated synthetic data, suggesting that LLMs possess graph understanding abilities that RL can elicit successfully. Our implementation is open-sourced at https://github.com/PKU-ML/G1, with models and datasets hosted on Hugging Face collections https://huggingface.co/collections/PKU-ML/g1-683d659e992794fc99618cf2 for broader accessibility.

Abstract: Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation aims to create videos that faithfully incorporate reference content, providing enhanced flexibility in the production of videos. To establish the infrastructure for S2V generation, we propose OpenS2V-Nexus, consisting of (i) OpenS2V-Eval, a fine-grained benchmark, and (ii) OpenS2V-5M, a million-scale dataset. In contrast to existing S2V benchmarks inherited from VBench that focus on global and coarse-grained assessment of generated videos, OpenS2V-Eval focuses on the model's ability to generate subject-consistent videos with natural subject appearance and identity fidelity. For these purposes, OpenS2V-Eval introduces 180 prompts from seven major categories of S2V, which incorporate both real and synthetic test data. Furthermore, to accurately align human preferences with S2V benchmarks, we propose three automatic metrics, NexusScore, NaturalScore and GmeScore, to separately quantify subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. Building on this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 18 representative S2V models, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses across different content. Moreover, we create the first open-source large-scale S2V generation dataset OpenS2V-5M, which consists of five million high-quality 720P subject-text-video triples. Specifically, we ensure subject-information diversity in our dataset by (1) segmenting subjects and building pairing information via cross-video associations and (2) prompting GPT-Image-1 on raw frames to synthesize multi-view representations. Through OpenS2V-Nexus, we deliver a robust infrastructure to accelerate future S2V generation research.

<title>Beyond Prompt Engineering: Robust Behavior Control in LLMs via Steering Target Atoms</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20322</link>

arXiv:2505.20322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control over language model generation is vital for ensuring both safety and reliability. Although prompt engineering and steering are commonly used to intervene in model behaviors, the vast number of parameters in models often results in highly intertwined internal representations. This interdependency can limit control precision and sometimes lead to unintended side effects. Recent research has explored the use of sparse autoencoders (SAE) to disentangle knowledge in high-dimensional spaces for steering. However, these applications have been limited to toy tasks owing to the nontrivial issue of locating atomic knowledge components. In this paper, we propose Steering Target Atoms (STA), a novel method that isolates and manipulates disentangled knowledge components to enhance safety. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering exhibits superior robustness and flexibility, particularly in adversarial scenarios. We also apply the steering strategy to the large reasoning model, confirming its effectiveness in precise reasoning control.

<title>Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series</title>

arXiv:2505.20697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.

<title>VRAG-RL: Empower Vision-Perception-Based RAG for Visually Rich Information Understanding via Iterative Reasoning with Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2505.22019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effectively retrieving, reasoning and understanding visually rich information remains a challenge for RAG methods. Traditional text-based methods cannot handle visual-related information. On the other hand, current vision-based RAG approaches are often limited by fixed pipelines and frequently struggle to reason effectively due to the insufficient activation of the fundamental capabilities of models. As RL has been proven to be beneficial for model reasoning, we introduce VRAG-RL, a novel RL framework tailored for complex reasoning across visually rich information. With this framework, VLMs interact with search engines, autonomously sampling single-turn or multi-turn reasoning trajectories with the help of visual perception tokens and undergoing continual optimization based on these samples. Our approach highlights key limitations of RL in RAG domains: (i) Prior Multi-modal RAG approaches tend to merely incorporate images into the context, leading to insufficient reasoning token allocation and neglecting visual-specific perception; and (ii) When models interact with search engines, their queries often fail to retrieve relevant information due to the inability to articulate requirements, thereby leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we define an action space tailored for visually rich inputs, with actions including cropping and scaling, allowing the model to gather information from a coarse-to-fine perspective. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between users' original inquiries and the retriever, we employ a simple yet effective reward that integrates query rewriting and retrieval performance with a model-based reward. Our VRAG-RL optimizes VLMs for RAG tasks using specially designed RL strategies, aligning the model with real-world applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Alibaba-NLP/VRAG.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to promote reproducibility at https://github.com/zjt-gpu/IOHFuseLM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for data generation. However, creating evaluation benchmarks raises the bar for this emerging paradigm. Benchmarks must target specific phenomena, penalize exploiting shortcuts, and be challenging. Through two case studies, we investigate whether LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the original crowdsourcing effort. However, we show that they are less challenging for LLMs than their human-authored counterparts. This finding sheds light on what may have been lost by generating evaluation data with LLMs, and calls for critically reassessing the immediate use of this increasingly prevalent approach to benchmark creation.

Abstract: This study presents a multimodal AI framework designed for precisely classifying medical diagnostic images. Utilizing publicly available datasets, the proposed system compares the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and different large language models (LLMs). This in-depth comparative analysis highlights key differences in diagnostic performance, execution efficiency, and environmental impacts. Model evaluation was based on accuracy, F1-score, average execution time, average energy consumption, and estimated $CO_2$ emission. The findings indicate that although CNN-based models can outperform various multimodal techniques that incorporate both images and contextual information, applying additional filtering on top of LLMs can lead to substantial performance gains. These findings highlight the transformative potential of multimodal AI systems to enhance the reliability, efficiency, and scalability of medical diagnostics in clinical settings.

Abstract: Neural network inference typically operates on raw input data, increasing the risk of exposure during preprocessing and inference. Moreover, neural architectures lack efficient built-in mechanisms for directly authenticating input data. This work introduces a novel encryption method for ensuring the security of neural inference. By constructing key-conditioned chaotic graph dynamical systems, we enable the encryption and decryption of real-valued tensors within the neural architecture. The proposed dynamical systems are particularly suited to encryption due to their sensitivity to initial conditions and their capacity to produce complex, key-dependent nonlinear transformations from compact rules. This work establishes a paradigm for securing neural inference and opens new avenues for research on the application of graph dynamical systems in neural network security.

Abstract: Theorem proving serves as a major testbed for evaluating complex reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs). However, traditional automated theorem proving (ATP) approaches rely heavily on formal proof systems that poorly align with LLMs' strength derived from informal, natural language knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference. Additionally, we propose comprehensive outcome and process evaluation metrics examining proof correctness and the quality of reasoning steps. Extensive experimental analyses demonstrate DeepTheorem significantly improves LLM theorem-proving performance compared to existing datasets and supervised fine-tuning protocols, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and reasoning quality. Our findings highlight DeepTheorem's potential to fundamentally advance automated informal theorem proving and mathematical exploration.

Summary:
Language models have shown impressive capabilities in task-specific applications through fine-tuning, but extending these benefits across diverse languages is crucial for broader accessibility. However, challenges arise due to performance gaps and limited fine-tuning data in many languages. A study analyzing over 1,000 language pairs reveals that middle layers of language models exhibit significant potential for cross-lingual alignment. To leverage this, a middle-layer alignment objective is proposed for integration into task-specific training, resulting in consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, particularly to lower-resource languages. The method is flexible in alignment language selection and generalizes well to unseen languages. Additionally, the study demonstrates that separately trained alignment modules can enhance cross-lingual capabilities without requiring full re-training. The code for the proposed method is openly available for public use.

Abstract: While large language models demonstrate remarkable capabilities at task-specific applications through fine-tuning, extending these benefits across diverse languages is essential for broad accessibility. However, effective cross-lingual transfer is hindered by LLM performance gaps across languages and the scarcity of fine-tuning data in many languages. Through analysis of LLM internal representations from over 1,000+ language pairs, we discover that middle layers exhibit the strongest potential for cross-lingual alignment. Building on this finding, we propose a middle-layer alignment objective integrated into task-specific training. Our experiments on slot filling, machine translation, and structured text generation show consistent improvements in cross-lingual transfer, especially to lower-resource languages. The method is robust to the choice of alignment languages and generalizes to languages unseen during alignment. Furthermore, we show that separately trained alignment modules can be merged with existing task-specific modules, improving cross-lingual capabilities without full re-training. Our code is publicly available (https://github.com/dannigt/mid-align).

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MADCluster, a novel model-agnostic anomaly detection framework utilizing self-supervised clustering. MADCluster is applicable to various deep learning architectures and addresses the 'hypersphere collapse' problem inherent in existing deep learning-based anomaly detection methods. The core idea is to cluster normal pattern data into a 'single cluster' while simultaneously learning the cluster center and mapping data close to this center. Also, to improve expressiveness and enable effective single clustering, we propose a new 'One-directed Adaptive loss'. The optimization of this loss is mathematically proven. MADCluster consists of three main components: Base Embedder capturing high-dimensional temporal dynamics, Cluster Distance Mapping, and Sequence-wise Clustering for continuous center updates. Its model-agnostic characteristics are achieved by applying various architectures to the Base Embedder. Experiments on four time series benchmark datasets demonstrate that applying MADCluster improves the overall performance of comparative models. In conclusion, the compatibility of MADCluster shows potential for enhancing model performance across various architectures.

Abstract: AI copilots represent a new generation of AI-powered systems designed to assist users, particularly knowledge workers and developers, in complex, context-rich tasks. As these systems become more embedded in daily workflows, personalization has emerged as a critical factor for improving usability, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. Central to this personalization is preference optimization: the system's ability to detect, interpret, and align with individual user preferences. While prior work in intelligent assistants and optimization algorithms is extensive, their intersection within AI copilots remains underexplored. This survey addresses that gap by examining how user preferences are operationalized in AI copilots. We investigate how preference signals are sourced, modeled across different interaction stages, and refined through feedback loops. Building on a comprehensive literature review, we define the concept of an AI copilot and introduce a taxonomy of preference optimization techniques across pre-, mid-, and post-interaction phases. Each technique is evaluated in terms of advantages, limitations, and design implications. By consolidating fragmented efforts across AI personalization, human-AI interaction, and language model adaptation, this work offers both a unified conceptual foundation and a practical design perspective for building user-aligned, persona-aware AI copilots that support end-to-end adaptability and deployment.

<div> framework, Human-AI collaboration, Security Operations Centers, autonomy, trust calibration, Human-in-the-loop decision making
Summary: 
This article introduces a structured framework for Human-AI collaboration in Security Operations Centers (SOCs), addressing limitations in existing frameworks that focus solely on automation. The proposed framework includes five levels of AI autonomy, mapping to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. It enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions such as monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. The framework emphasizes the importance of formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL in SOC tasks, allowing for effective task distribution based on operational complexity and risks. A case study with the cybersecurity AI-Avatar demonstrates how human-AI collaboration can reduce alert fatigue, improve response coordination, and enhance trust calibration. Overall, this research highlights the potential of AI to enhance, rather than replace, human decision-making in cybersecurity operations.

Abstract: This article presents a structured framework for Human-AI collaboration in Security Operations Centers (SOCs), integrating AI autonomy, trust calibration, and Human-in-the-loop decision making. Existing frameworks in SOCs often focus narrowly on automation, lacking systematic structures to manage human oversight, trust calibration, and scalable autonomy with AI. Many assume static or binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity, criticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework grounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions, including monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident response. The proposed framework differentiates itself from previous research by creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various SOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to operational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified through a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a fine-tuned LLM-based SOC assistant. The AI-Avatar case study illustrates human-AI collaboration for SOC tasks, reducing alert fatigue, enhancing response coordination, and strategically calibrating trust. This research systematically presents both the theoretical and practical aspects and feasibility of designing next-generation cognitive SOCs that leverage AI not to replace but to enhance human decision-making.

<div> survival bandit framework, constraint exposure, misalignment, risk-seeking, risk-averse <br />
Summary:
This study explores the behavior of AI agents with agentic capabilities in settings with resource or failure constraints. The agents, designed to interact with humans and make decisions based on utility functions, must navigate trade-offs when facing constraints that may terminate action sequences prematurely. The asymmetries in constraint exposure can lead to misalignments between human objectives and agent incentives. Through a survival bandit framework, the study quantifies the impact of survival-driven preference shifts and identifies conditions for misalignment. It also proposes mechanisms to mitigate risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviors that may arise. By increasing understanding of AI agents operating under survival pressure, this work offers guidelines for safely deploying such systems in resource-limited environments. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Advanced reasoning models with agentic capabilities (AI agents) are deployed to interact with humans and to solve sequential decision-making problems under (approximate) utility functions and internal models. When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.

<br />
Summary: 
Formula Tuning (Fortune) is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the performance of large language models in accurately understanding and reasoning with tabular data, particularly in complex scenarios. By training language models to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data, Formula Tuning reduces the need for supervised formula annotations by using answer correctness as a reward signal to guide model learning. The framework enhances language model performance, especially in multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, ultimately enabling a 7B model to outperform OpenAI o1 in table understanding benchmarks. This highlights the potential of formula-driven reinforcement learning to advance symbolic table reasoning in language models. <div>

Abstract: Tables are a fundamental structure for organizing and analyzing data, making effective table understanding a critical capability for intelligent systems. While large language models (LMs) demonstrate strong general reasoning abilities, they continue to struggle with accurate numerical or symbolic reasoning over tabular data, especially in complex scenarios. Spreadsheet formulas provide a powerful and expressive medium for representing executable symbolic operations, encoding rich reasoning patterns that remain largely underutilized. In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform OpenAI o1 on table understanding. This highlights the potential of formula-driven RL to advance symbolic table reasoning in LMs.

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of efficiently selecting Large Language Models (LLMs) for diverse downstream tasks due to computational constraints. It introduces a novel theoretical framework that sheds light on the fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs to enhance understanding of their generalization capabilities. The proposed LENSLLM model, based on Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), offers accurate performance predictions across tasks while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The proliferation of open-sourced Large Language Models (LLMs) and diverse downstream tasks necessitates efficient model selection, given the impracticality of fine-tuning all candidates due to computational constraints. Despite the recent advances in LLM selection, a fundamental research question largely remains nascent: how can we model the dynamic behaviors of LLMs during fine-tuning, thereby enhancing our understanding of their generalization performance across diverse downstream tasks? In this work, we propose a novel theoretical framework that provides a proper lens to assess the generalization capabilities of LLMs, thereby enabling accurate and efficient LLM selection for downstream applications. In particular, we first derive a PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound that unveils fine-tuning dynamics of LLMs and then introduce LENSLLM, a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based Rectified Scaling Model that enables accurate performance predictions across diverse tasks while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive empirical results on 3 large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves up to 91.1% accuracy and reduces up to 88.5% computational cost in LLM selection, outperforming 5 state-of-the-art methods. We open-source our proposed LENSLLM model and corresponding results at LensLLM.io.

Summary:
DigiFakeAV is a new large-scale dataset for digital human forgery based on diffusion models, containing 60,000 videos across various demographics and scenarios. Participants in user studies had a high misrecognition rate of up to 68%, revealing the realism of the dataset. Existing detection models showed significant performance degradation on DigiFakeAV, highlighting the challenges posed by diffusion-based deepfake technology. To address this issue, DigiShield, a detection baseline leveraging spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion, achieved state-of-the-art performance on DigiFakeAV and demonstrated strong generalization to other datasets. This research underscores the growing threat of deepfake technology to public security and the urgent need for advanced detection strategies to combat the dissemination of highly realistic fake videos.

arXiv:2505.16512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the explosive advancement of deepfake technology has posed a critical and escalating threat to public security: diffusion-based digital human generation. Unlike traditional face manipulation methods, such models can generate highly realistic videos with consistency via multimodal control signals. Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the new large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models. Leveraging five of the latest digital human generation methods and a voice cloning method, we systematically construct a dataset comprising 60,000 videos (8.4 million frames), covering multiple nationalities, skin tones, genders, and real-world scenarios, significantly enhancing data diversity and realism. User studies demonstrate that the misrecognition rate by participants for DigiFakeAV reaches as high as 68%. Moreover, the substantial performance degradation of existing detection models on our dataset further highlights its challenges. To address this problem, we propose DigiShield, an effective detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the DigiFakeAV and shows strong generalization on other datasets.

Summary:
Large language models such as OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus were benchmarked on a dataset of 5,080 YouTube comments to evaluate their performance in identifying harmful content. GPT-4.1 achieved the best balance of precision and recall, while Gemini flagged the highest number of harmful posts but with lower precision. Claude had the highest precision but lower recall. All three models struggled with sarcasm, coded insults, and mixed-language slang. The study highlights the need for moderation pipelines that combine different models, consider conversational context, and address challenges in under-represented languages and implicit abuse. The dataset and prompts used in the study have been made publicly available for reproducibility and further advancements in automated content moderation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As online platforms grow, comment sections increasingly host harassment that undermines user experience and well-being. This study benchmarks three leading large language models, OpenAI GPT-4.1, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus, on a corpus of 5,080 YouTube comments sampled from high-abuse threads in gaming, lifestyle, food vlog, and music channels. The dataset comprises 1,334 harmful and 3,746 non-harmful messages in English, Arabic, and Indonesian, annotated independently by two reviewers with substantial agreement (Cohen's kappa = 0.83). Using a unified prompt and deterministic settings, GPT-4.1 achieved the best overall balance with an F1 score of 0.863, precision of 0.887, and recall of 0.841. Gemini flagged the highest share of harmful posts (recall = 0.875) but its precision fell to 0.767 due to frequent false positives. Claude delivered the highest precision at 0.920 and the lowest false-positive rate of 0.022, yet its recall dropped to 0.720. Qualitative analysis showed that all three models struggle with sarcasm, coded insults, and mixed-language slang. These results underscore the need for moderation pipelines that combine complementary models, incorporate conversational context, and fine-tune for under-represented languages and implicit abuse. A de-identified version of the dataset and full prompts is publicly released to promote reproducibility and further progress in automated content moderation.

Summary: 
- The study focuses on the impact of reasoning length on the hallucination in multimodal large language models.
- A new metric RH-AUC is introduced to quantify changes in perception accuracy with reasoning length.
- RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark, is released to evaluate the balance between reasoning ability and hallucination in various multimodal tasks.
- Larger models tend to maintain a better balance between reasoning and perception.
- The types and domains of training data have a greater influence on the balance between reasoning ability and hallucination than the volume of data.
- Evaluation frameworks should consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity for a comprehensive assessment of multimodal models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.21523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-time compute has empowered multimodal large language models to generate extended reasoning chains, yielding strong performance on tasks such as multimodal math reasoning. However, this improved reasoning ability often comes with increased hallucination: as generations become longer, models tend to drift away from image-grounded content and rely more heavily on language priors. Attention analysis shows that longer reasoning chains lead to reduced focus on visual inputs, which contributes to hallucination. To systematically study this phenomenon, we introduce RH-AUC, a metric that quantifies how a model's perception accuracy changes with reasoning length, allowing us to evaluate whether the model preserves visual grounding during reasoning. We also release RH-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark that spans a variety of multimodal tasks, designed to assess the trade-off between reasoning ability and hallucination. Our analysis reveals that (i) larger models typically achieve a better balance between reasoning and perception, and (ii) this balance is influenced more by the types and domains of training data than by its overall volume. These findings underscore the importance of evaluation frameworks that jointly consider both reasoning quality and perceptual fidelity.

<div> FFN layers, attention layers, Vision Transformer, latency, efficiency <br />

Summary:
The study finds that FFN layers are the main contributors to Vision Transformer (ViT) inference latency, especially as model size increases. A novel channel idle mechanism is proposed to optimize the efficiency of large-scale ViTs by focusing on FFN layers. This mechanism allows for post-training structural reparameterization, where idle feature channels bypass the nonlinear activation function in FFN layers, resulting in faster inference. RePaViTs, the resulting family of models, show significant latency reductions with acceptable accuracy trade-offs, which tend to improve on larger models. For instance, RePa-ViT-Large and RePa-ViT-Huge achieve notable speed-ups with slightly higher accuracies under the same training strategy. This approach marks the first use of structural reparameterization on FFN layers to accelerate ViTs and suggests a promising direction for efficient ViTs in the future. <div>

Abstract: We reveal that feedforward network (FFN) layers, rather than attention layers, are the primary contributors to Vision Transformer (ViT) inference latency, with their impact signifying as model size increases. This finding highlights a critical opportunity for optimizing the efficiency of large-scale ViTs by focusing on FFN layers. In this work, we propose a novel channel idle mechanism that facilitates post-training structural reparameterization for efficient FFN layers during testing. Specifically, a set of feature channels remains idle and bypasses the nonlinear activation function in each FFN layer, thereby forming a linear pathway that enables structural reparameterization during inference. This mechanism results in a family of ReParameterizable Vision Transformers (RePaViTs), which achieve remarkable latency reductions with acceptable sacrifices (sometimes gains) in accuracy across various ViTs. The benefits of our method scale consistently with model sizes, demonstrating greater speed improvements and progressively narrowing accuracy gaps or even higher accuracies on larger models. In particular, RePa-ViT-Large and RePa-ViT-Huge enjoy 66.8% and 68.7% speed-ups with +1.7% and +1.1% higher top-1 accuracies under the same training strategy, respectively. RePaViT is the first to employ structural reparameterization on FFN layers to expedite ViTs to our best knowledge, and we believe that it represents an auspicious direction for efficient ViTs.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a more practical threat model for adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits called Fake Data Injection, where attackers can inject a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples. Efficient attack strategies are designed considering magnitude and temporal constraints. Theoretical analysis reveals that these attacks can mislead UCB and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm with minimal attack cost. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of these strategies, exposing vulnerabilities in common stochastic bandit algorithms under realistic adversarial scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2505.21938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on stochastic bandits have traditionally relied on some unrealistic assumptions, such as per-round reward manipulation and unbounded perturbations, limiting their relevance to real-world systems. We propose a more practical threat model, Fake Data Injection, which reflects realistic adversarial constraints: the attacker can inject only a limited number of bounded fake feedback samples into the learner's history, simulating legitimate interactions. We design efficient attack strategies under this model, explicitly addressing both magnitude constraints (on reward values) and temporal constraints (on when and how often data can be injected). Our theoretical analysis shows that these attacks can mislead both Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms into selecting a target arm in nearly all rounds while incurring only sublinear attack cost. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our strategies, revealing significant vulnerabilities in widely used stochastic bandit algorithms under practical adversarial scenarios.

Summary: 
The article introduces iDSE, a novel Design Space Exploration (DSE) framework that leverages Machine Learning Models (LLMs) to enhance High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design optimization. iDSE aims to efficiently navigate the complex design space in HLS by intelligently pruning design options and utilizing LLMs for calibration. By leveraging convergent and divergent thinking patterns of LLMs, iDSE achieves multi-path refinement of design quality and diversity. Experimental results show that iDSE outperforms heuristic-based DSE methods by a significant margin, approaching the reference Pareto front with minimal designs explored. The study highlights the transformative potential of LLMs in scalable and efficient HLS optimization, providing valuable insights into multiobjective optimization challenges in hardware design. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.22086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) serves as an agile hardware development tool that streamlines the circuit design by abstracting the register transfer level into behavioral descriptions, while allowing designers to customize the generated microarchitectures through optimization directives. However, the combinatorial explosion of possible directive configurations yields an intractable design space. Traditional design space exploration (DSE) methods, despite adopting heuristics or constructing predictive models to accelerate Pareto-optimal design acquisition, still suffer from prohibitive exploration costs and suboptimal results. Addressing these concerns, we introduce iDSE, the first LLM-aided DSE framework that leverages HLS design quality perception to effectively navigate the design space. iDSE intelligently pruns the design space to guide LLMs in calibrating representative initial sampling designs, expediting convergence toward the Pareto front. By exploiting the convergent and divergent thinking patterns inherent in LLMs for hardware optimization, iDSE achieves multi-path refinement of the design quality and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that iDSE outperforms heuristic-based DSE methods by 5.1$\times$$\sim$16.6$\times$ in proximity to the reference Pareto front, matching NSGA-II with only 4.6% of the explored designs. Our work demonstrates the transformative potential of LLMs in scalable and efficient HLS design optimization, offering new insights into multiobjective optimization challenges.

Summary: <br />
High-quality multilingual training data is crucial for effective pretraining of large language models (LLMs). The existing availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets is limited, often relying on heuristic filtering methods. In this study, the JQL approach is introduced, which systematically curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while reducing computational demands. The JQL process utilizes lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings to enhance multilingual and cross-lingual performance for languages and scripts not seen during training. Empirical evaluation across 35 languages demonstrates that JQL outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2, improving downstream model training quality and data retention rates. This research offers practical insights and resources for multilingual data curation, setting higher standards for multilingual dataset development. <br /> <div>

Abstract: High-quality multilingual training data is essential for effectively pretraining large language models (LLMs). Yet, the availability of suitable open-source multilingual datasets remains limited. Existing state-of-the-art datasets mostly rely on heuristic filtering methods, restricting both their cross-lingual transferability and scalability. Here, we introduce JQL, a systematic approach that efficiently curates diverse and high-quality multilingual data at scale while significantly reducing computational demands. JQL distills LLMs' annotation capabilities into lightweight annotators based on pretrained multilingual embeddings. These models exhibit robust multilingual and cross-lingual performance, even for languages and scripts unseen during training. Evaluated empirically across 35 languages, the resulting annotation pipeline substantially outperforms current heuristic filtering methods like Fineweb2. JQL notably enhances downstream model training quality and increases data retention rates. Our research provides practical insights and valuable resources for multilingual data curation, raising the standards of multilingual dataset development.

FastTD3 solves a range of HumanoidBench tasks in under 3 hours on a single A100 GPU, while remaining stable during training. We also provide a lightweight and easy-to-use implementation of FastTD3 to accelerate RL research in robotics.

Abstract: The development of speech foundation models (SFMs) like Whisper and SeamlessM4T has significantly advanced the field of speech processing. However, their closed nature--with inaccessible training data and code--poses major reproducibility and fair evaluation challenges. While other domains have made substantial progress toward open science by developing fully transparent models trained on open-source (OS) code and data, similar efforts in speech remain limited. To fill this gap, we introduce FAMA, the first family of open science SFMs for English and Italian, trained on 150k+ hours of OS speech data. Moreover, we present a new dataset containing 16k hours of cleaned and pseudo-labeled speech for both languages. Results show that FAMA achieves competitive performance compared to existing SFMs while being up to 8 times faster. All artifacts, including code, datasets, and models, are released under OS-compliant licenses, promoting openness in speech technology research.

Summary:<br />
The study discusses the impact of AI programming tools on users' decision-making processes, particularly in critical domains like software security. It introduces Human-in-the-loop Decoding (HiLDe) as an interaction technique that allows users to observe and influence decisions made by the Language Model (LLM) during code generation. HiLDe highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for users to explore, leading to better alignment of code generation with personal goals. A study involving 18 participants on security-related tasks showed that HiLDe resulted in fewer vulnerabilities generated and improved user alignment with their goals compared to traditional code completion assistants. This research emphasizes the importance of involving users in the decision-making process when utilizing AI programming tools, particularly in areas where security is paramount. <div>

Abstract: While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers' capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.

Summary: 
The article discusses the development of a benchmark, CHED, to evaluate the context robustness of knowledge editing (KE) methods in language models. It highlights the importance of considering preceding contexts in evaluating KE success, as they can impact the intended edit. The study introduces the CoRE method, which aims to improve context robustness by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden model states. Evaluations on CHED show that existing KE methods often fail when preceding contexts are present, underscoring the need for better context handling. The CoRE method not only enhances editing success rates in the presence of contexts but also maintains the overall model capabilities. The article also examines the effects of different types of preceding contexts, such as user utterances and assistant responses, on editing success and analyzes attention-score patterns to understand token influences. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge editing (KE) methods offer an efficient way to modify knowledge in large language models. Current KE evaluations typically assess editing success by considering only the edited knowledge without any preceding contexts. In real-world applications, however, preceding contexts often trigger the retrieval of the original knowledge and undermine the intended edit. To address this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge. This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the model. We provide an in-depth analysis of the differing impacts of preceding contexts when introduced as user utterances versus assistant responses, and we dissect attention-score patterns to assess how specific tokens influence editing success.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces MatTA, a framework for training accurate Student models using a Teacher-TA-Student approach. TA models, larger versions of Student models, help students relate better to the Teacher model and provide domain-specific expertise. Multiple accurate Student models can be extracted from the TA model, offering servable options with varying accuracy and serving costs. The efficacy of MatTA is demonstrated on proprietary datasets, showing a 20% improvement in a production ML system. Additionally, experiments on GPT-2 Medium showcase relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA benchmark. Overall, MatTA offers a practical solution for developing industry-grade ML models efficiently while meeting evolving serving constraints. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Industry-grade ML models are carefully designed to meet rapidly evolving serving constraints, which requires significant resources for model development. In this paper, we propose MatTA, a framework for training multiple accurate Student models using a novel Teacher-TA-Student recipe. TA models are larger versions of the Student models with higher capacity, and thus allow Student models to better relate to the Teacher model and also bring in more domain-specific expertise. Furthermore, multiple accurate Student models can be extracted from the TA model. Therefore, despite only one training run, our methodology provides multiple servable options to trade off accuracy for lower serving cost. We demonstrate the proposed method, MatTA, on proprietary datasets and models. Its practical efficacy is underscored by live A/B tests within a production ML system, demonstrating 20% improvement on a key metric. We also demonstrate our method on GPT-2 Medium, a public model, and achieve relative improvements of over 24% on SAT Math and over 10% on the LAMBADA benchmark.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel test-time iterative optimization framework to improve code efficiency in Large Language Models (LLMs). Three training strategies were explored: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). SFT and DPO showed rapid saturation in efficiency gains, while GRPO, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously optimized code performance. Experiments on the Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark demonstrated that GRPO significantly improved code efficiency, increasing pass@1 from 47% to 62% and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency from 31% to 45%. The study highlights the effectiveness of test-time code efficiency enhancement and the capability of RL in teaching LLMs to autonomously enhance code efficiency. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate functionally correct solutions but often fall short in code efficiency, a critical bottleneck for real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time iterative optimization framework to address this, employing a closed-loop system where LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an execution sandbox. We explore three training strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on our Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark show that SFT and DPO rapidly saturate in efficiency gains. In contrast, GRPO, using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously optimizes code performance, significantly boosting both pass@1 (from 47% to 62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency (from 31% to 45%). Our work demonstrates effective test-time code efficiency improvement and critically reveals the power of RL in teaching LLMs to truly self-improve code efficiency.

Summary:
SWE-bench-Live is introduced as a dynamic benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) by generating patches for real-world bugs. The existing benchmarks, like SWE-bench, have limitations due to outdated data and manual processes. SWE-bench-Live addresses these issues by providing 1,319 tasks from recent GitHub issues across 93 repositories, with reproducible Docker images for each task. The \method automated curation pipeline streamlines task creation and environment setup, enhancing scalability and continuous updates. Evaluation of LLMs on SWE-bench-Live reveals a performance gap compared to static benchmarks. Detailed analyses on repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty are performed to understand the differences. This live and diverse benchmark offers a contamination-resistant evaluation environment for LLMs and agents in real-world software development scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.23419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The issue-resolving task, where a model generates patches to fix real-world bugs, has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While SWE-bench and its variants have become standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and data contamination. In this work, we present SWE-bench-Live, a live-updatable benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous, contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world software development settings.

<div> Keywords: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems, autonomous swarms, computer vision, large language models, search-and-rescue missions 

Summary: 
Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are being used in autonomous swarms for search-and-rescue missions, relying on computer vision technology to detect objects. However, traditional CV systems face challenges in recognizing unfamiliar objects and their relevance. To address this, large language models (LLMs) are integrated to provide insights, although they may produce incorrect recommendations. To ensure safe decision-making, cognitive guardrails are essential. This article introduces the design, simulation, and real-world implementation of cognitive guardrails for sUAS swarms in search-and-rescue missions. The aim is to enable sUAS to make sensible decisions and adapt their missions effectively, even in uncertain and complex environments. The incorporation of LLMs and cognitive guardrails enhances the capabilities of sUAS in disaster-response scenarios, improving their ability to navigate and respond to changing conditions for successful mission outcomes.

Abstract: Small Uncrewed Aerial Systems (sUAS) are increasingly deployed as autonomous swarms in search-and-rescue and other disaster-response scenarios. In these settings, they use computer vision (CV) to detect objects of interest and autonomously adapt their missions. However, traditional CV systems often struggle to recognize unfamiliar objects in open-world environments or to infer their relevance for mission planning. To address this, we incorporate large language models (LLMs) to reason about detected objects and their implications. While LLMs can offer valuable insights, they are also prone to hallucinations and may produce incorrect, misleading, or unsafe recommendations. To ensure safe and sensible decision-making under uncertainty, high-level decisions must be governed by cognitive guardrails. This article presents the design, simulation, and real-world integration of these guardrails for sUAS swarms in search-and-rescue missions.

<div> Keywords: rule-based reinforcement learning, multimodal large language models, jigsaw puzzles, visual tasks, generalization

Summary:
Our study focuses on rule-based visual reinforcement learning using jigsaw puzzles as an experimental framework. We found that multimodal large language models initially perform poorly on simple jigsaw puzzles but achieve high accuracy after fine-tuning, even on complex configurations. Training on jigsaw puzzles can lead to generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness varying based on task configurations. Models can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, although they often favor direct answering. Complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, increasing in frequency with training and task difficulty. Reinforcement learning shows more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning, and a cold start phase with SFT can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Our research contributes to understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning. <div>

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Summary: 
ActLCD is a new decoding strategy that aims to improve factuality in large language models (LLMs) by actively deciding when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By treating decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD uses a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. The method surpasses existing approaches across five benchmarks and demonstrates effectiveness in reducing hallucinations in various generation scenarios. This innovative approach addresses the limitations of current methods by actively controlling the generation process and improving factuality in long-context scenarios. ActLCD represents a promising avenue for mitigating the shortcomings of LLMs and enhancing their performance in language generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models (LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.

Abstract: Developing high-performance software is a complex task that requires specialized expertise. We introduce GSO, a benchmark for evaluating language models' capabilities in developing high-performance software. We develop an automated pipeline that generates and executes performance tests to analyze repository commit histories to identify 102 challenging optimization tasks across 10 codebases, spanning diverse domains and programming languages. An agent is provided with a codebase and performance test as a precise specification, and tasked to improve the runtime efficiency, which is measured against the expert developer optimization. Our quantitative evaluation reveals that leading SWE-Agents struggle significantly, achieving less than 5% success rate, with limited improvements even with inference-time scaling. Our qualitative analysis identifies key failure modes, including difficulties with low-level languages, practicing lazy optimization strategies, and challenges in accurately localizing bottlenecks. We release the code and artifacts of our benchmark along with agent trajectories to enable future research.

Summary: 
The study introduces SITAlign, a framework for aligning large language models with humans that considers the multifaceted nature of preference feedback. It addresses human decision making's bounded rationality by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. The approach aims to optimize helpfulness while ensuring harmlessness, reflecting how humans make decisions through satisficing strategies. The theoretical analysis provides sub-optimality bounds for the proposed satisficing-based inference alignment approach. Empirical validation on various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of SITAlign, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-objective decoding strategies by significant margins. For example, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, SITAlign improves the GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward by 22.3% while meeting the harmlessness threshold. <div>

Abstract: Aligning large language models with humans is challenging due to the inherently multifaceted nature of preference feedback. While existing approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on harmlessness.

Additionally, the integration of domain knowledge and intuitive human-AI interfaces is emphasized to create a unified ecosystem for scalable and accessible AI-driven design systems. Large language models are highlighted as interactive design agents that connect user intent with simulation tools, optimization pipelines, and collaborative workflows.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping inverse design across manufacturing domain, enabling high-performance discovery in materials, products, and processes. However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design spaces, and nontrivial physical constraints. This perspective argues for a new generation of design systems that transcend black-box modeling by integrating domain knowledge, physics-informed learning, and intuitive human-AI interfaces. We first demonstrate how expert-guided sampling strategies enhance data efficiency and model generalization. Next, we discuss how physics-informed machine learning enables physically consistent modeling in data-scarce regimes. Finally, we explore how large language models emerge as interactive design agents connecting user intent with simulation tools, optimization pipelines, and collaborative workflows. Through illustrative examples and conceptual frameworks, we advocate that inverse design in manufacturing should evolve into a unified ecosystem, where domain knowledge, physical priors, and adaptive reasoning collectively enable scalable, interpretable, and accessible AI-driven design systems.

Summary: 
AI agents are increasingly being used in consumer-facing applications for tasks like negotiation and transactions. This study explores a scenario where AI agents fully automate deal-making for consumers and merchants. The research aims to determine if different agents perform differently in securing favorable deals and assess the risks of fully automating transactions with AI agents. The experiment finds that AI-mediated deal-making is imbalanced, with various agents producing significantly different outcomes. Behavioral anomalies in AI agents can lead to financial losses for both consumers and merchants, including overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. This study highlights the efficiency benefits of automation but cautions users to be wary when delegating business decisions to AI agents. <br /> <div>

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover, behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating business decisions to AI agents.

<div> pricing, risk-based, regulation, fairness, AI-assisted 

Summary: 
Dynamic, risk-based pricing in essential markets like health insurance and consumer credit can lead to exclusion of vulnerable consumer groups. The article proposes a regulator aligning private incentives with social objectives through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. A formal proposition suggests firm-level penalties based on demographic disparities to address global opt-out disparities. Using an AI-based simulator called MarketSim, a reinforcement learning social planner is trained to select a fairness-tax close to a simple linear prior. The learned policy increases demand-fairness by up to 16%, outperforming unregulated markets and fixed linear schedules in terms of social welfare in U.S. health insurance and consumer credit markets. This approach demonstrates how AI-assisted regulation can create a win-win equilibrium in competitive markets, offering a transparent and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic, risk-based pricing can systematically exclude vulnerable consumer groups from essential resources such as health insurance and consumer credit. We show that a regulator can realign private incentives with social objectives through a learned, interpretable tax schedule. First, we provide a formal proposition that bounding each firm's \emph{local} demographic gap implicitly bounds the \emph{global} opt-out disparity, motivating firm-level penalties. Building on this insight we introduce \texttt{MarketSim} -- an open-source, scalable simulator of heterogeneous consumers and profit-maximizing firms -- and train a reinforcement learning (RL) social planner (SP) that selects a bracketed fairness-tax while remaining close to a simple linear prior via an $\mathcal{L}_1$ regularizer. The learned policy is thus both transparent and easily interpretable. In two empirically calibrated markets, i.e., U.S. health-insurance and consumer-credit, our planner simultaneously raises demand-fairness by up to $16\%$ relative to unregulated Free Market while outperforming a fixed linear schedule in terms of social welfare without explicit coordination. These results illustrate how AI-assisted regulation can convert a competitive social dilemma into a win-win equilibrium, providing a principled and practical framework for fairness-aware market oversight.

Abstract: The volume of textual data available in aviation safety reports presents a challenge for timely and accurate analysis. This paper examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can automate the process of extracting valuable insights from this data, ultimately enhancing aviation safety. The paper reviews ongoing efforts focused on the application of NLP and deep learning to aviation safety reports, with the goal of classifying the level of damage to an aircraft and identifying the phase of flight during which safety occurrences happen. Additionally, the paper explores the use of Topic Modeling (TM) to uncover latent thematic structures within aviation incident reports, aiming to identify recurring patterns and potential areas for safety improvement. The paper compares and contrasts the performance of various deep learning models and TM techniques applied to datasets from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), as well as the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), discussing the impact of dataset size and source on the accuracy of the analysis. The findings demonstrate that both NLP and deep learning, as well as TM, can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of aviation safety analysis, paving the way for more proactive safety management and risk mitigation strategies.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, Prompt Engineering, DEEVO, Evolutionary Optimization, Elo Ratings

Summary:
DEEVO is a novel framework for optimizing prompts in Large Language Models (LLMs) that addresses the challenges of subjective quality assessment tasks. By using a debate-driven evaluation with Elo-based selection, DEEVO enables exploration of the prompt space while maintaining semantic coherence. This approach incorporates feedback from successful and unsuccessful prompts to drive improvement and preserve diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results show that DEEVO outperforms manual prompt engineering and other optimization methods on both open-ended and close-ended tasks without requiring ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs' reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO advances prompt optimization research by eliminating the need for predetermined metrics to improve AI systems.

<br /><br />Summary: DEEVO is a framework for prompt optimization in LLMs that uses debate-driven evaluation and Elo ratings to improve prompts for complex tasks. It outperforms manual prompt engineering and other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing AI systems without relying on predefined metrics. <div>
arXiv:2506.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt engineering represents a critical bottleneck to harness the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for solving complex tasks, as it requires specialized expertise, significant trial-and-error, and manual intervention. This challenge is particularly pronounced for tasks involving subjective quality assessment, where defining explicit optimization objectives becomes fundamentally problematic. Existing automated prompt optimization methods falter in these scenarios, as they typically require well-defined task-specific numerical fitness functions or rely on generic templates that cannot capture the nuanced requirements of complex use cases. We introduce DEEVO (DEbate-driven EVOlutionary prompt optimization), a novel framework that guides prompt evolution through a debate-driven evaluation with an Elo-based selection. Contrary to prior work, DEEVOs approach enables exploration of the discrete prompt space while preserving semantic coherence through intelligent crossover and strategic mutation operations that incorporate debate-based feedback, combining elements from both successful and unsuccessful prompts based on identified strengths rather than arbitrary splicing. Using Elo ratings as a fitness proxy, DEEVO simultaneously drives improvement and preserves valuable diversity in the prompt population. Experimental results demonstrate that DEEVO significantly outperforms both manual prompt engineering and alternative state-of-the-art optimization approaches on open-ended tasks and close-ended tasks despite using no ground truth feedback. By connecting LLMs reasoning capabilities with adaptive optimization, DEEVO represents a significant advancement in prompt optimization research by eliminating the need of predetermined metrics to continuously improve AI systems.

Summary: <br />
Generative AI is being used by developers to increase productivity, but concerns about workforce disruption and deskilling persist. Research with 21 developers revealed 12 work goals, 75 tasks, and the necessary skills and knowledge in four domains: using Generative AI effectively, core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and adjacent non-engineering. Five insights were distilled, highlighting the importance of reskilling and upskilling developers for the AI era. The skills and knowledge required for success in this field are crucial for future-proofing developers and safeguarding against deskilling. On-the-job learning initiatives and computer science degree programs will need to focus on both technical and soft skills across all four domains to prepare developers for the challenges and opportunities presented by AI. <div>

Abstract: Generative AI is showing early evidence of productivity gains for software developers, but concerns persist regarding workforce disruption and deskilling. We describe our research with 21 developers at the cutting edge of using AI, summarizing 12 of their work goals we uncovered, together with 75 associated tasks and the skills & knowledge for each, illustrating how developers use AI at work. From all of these, we distilled our findings in the form of 5 insights. We found that the skills & knowledge to be a successful AI-enhanced developer are organized into four domains (using Generative AI effectively, core software engineering, adjacent engineering, and adjacent non-engineering) deployed at critical junctures throughout a 6-step task workflow. In order to "future proof" developers for this age of AI, on-the-job learning initiatives and computer science degree programs will need to target both "soft" skills and the technical skills & knowledge in all four domains to reskill, upskill and safeguard against deskilling.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Ethical concerns, Transparent, FAIR principles, Ontological blocks<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various industries, but its rapid adoption raises ethical issues surrounding data ownership, privacy, and bias. To address these concerns, a modular ethical assessment framework based on ontological blocks is proposed. These blocks encode ethical principles such as fairness, accountability, and ownership, and are integrated with FAIR principles to enable scalable and transparent ethical evaluations. The framework supports compliance with the EU AI Act and facilitates dynamic risk classification in real-world applications, like AI-powered investor profiling. While ontological blocks show promise in enhancing AI ethics through explainability and auditability, challenges remain in automating and incorporating probabilistic reasoning. The framework provides a foundation for transparent and accountable AI systems in high-stakes domains. <div>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming sectors such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems, offering powerful tools for innovation. Yet its rapid integration raises urgent ethical concerns related to data ownership, privacy, and systemic bias. Issues like opaque decision-making, misleading outputs, and unfair treatment in high-stakes domains underscore the need for transparent and accountable AI systems. This article addresses these challenges by proposing a modular ethical assessment framework built on ontological blocks of meaning-discrete, interpretable units that encode ethical principles such as fairness, accountability, and ownership. By integrating these blocks with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, the framework supports scalable, transparent, and legally aligned ethical evaluations, including compliance with the EU AI Act. Using a real-world use case in AI-powered investor profiling, the paper demonstrates how the framework enables dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification. The findings suggest that ontological blocks offer a promising path toward explainable and auditable AI ethics, though challenges remain in automation and probabilistic reasoning.

<div> Keywords: AI, smell detection, SmellNet, chemical sensors, classification <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces the concept of using AI to detect and identify substances based on their smell, showcasing its potential in allergen detection, manufacturing process monitoring, and emotional state sensing. A new large-scale database called SmellNet is created, containing data on various substances found in nuts, spices, herbs, fruits, and vegetables. AI models trained using SmellNet show promising results in real-time substance classification based on smell alone. The models achieve up to 65.35% accuracy on pre-recorded data and demonstrate generalization to real-world conditions with significant accuracies on nuts and spices in a 50-way classification task. The study also highlights technical challenges in building AI for smell, including the need for richer feature learning, on-edge smell models, and robustness to environmental changes. Overall, the research emphasizes the potential of AI in the field of smell detection and highlights avenues for future advancements. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of AI to sense and identify various substances based on their smell alone can have profound impacts on allergen detection (e.g., smelling gluten or peanuts in a cake), monitoring the manufacturing process, and sensing hormones that indicate emotional states, stress levels, and diseases. Despite these broad impacts, there are virtually no large scale benchmarks, and therefore little progress, for training and evaluating AI systems' ability to smell in the real world. In this paper, we use portable gas and chemical sensors to create SmellNet, the first large-scale database that digitizes a diverse range of smells in the natural world. SmellNet contains about 180,000 time steps of 50 substances (spanning nuts, spices, herbs, fruits, and vegetables) with 50 hours of data. Using SmellNet, we train AI models for real-time classification of substances based on their smell alone. Our best methods leverage sequence models, contrastive learning to integrate high-resolution Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry molecular data, and a new temporal difference method that identifies sharp changes in sensor readings. Our best models achieve up to 65.35% accuracy on pre-recorded data, and generalize to real-world conditions with 10.71% accuracy on nuts and 25.38% on spices in the challenging 50-way online classification task. Despite these promising results, SmellNet highlights many technical challenges in building AI for smell, including richer feature learning, on-edge smell models, and robustness to environmental changes.

<div> framework, cultural sensitivity, language models, soft prompt, cultural alignment 

Summary: 
The research introduces a soft prompt fine-tuning framework to enhance cultural sensitivity in large language models (LLMs) for global applications. Current LLMs often lack nuanced understanding of diverse cultural contexts, requiring costly full fine-tuning for adaptation. The framework utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to route queries dynamically to culturally specialized 'expert' LLM configurations without altering the base model's parameters. Through optimizing soft prompt embeddings, the framework significantly improves alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering an efficient and modular solution for culturally-aware LLM deployment. This approach advances cultural coverage and expert adaptation in LLMs, leading to autonomous AI with nuanced understanding in a globally interconnected world.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into global applications necessitates effective cultural alignment for meaningful and culturally-sensitive interactions. Current LLMs often lack the nuanced understanding required for diverse cultural contexts, and adapting them typically involves costly full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a novel soft prompt fine-tuning framework that enables efficient and modular cultural alignment. Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability, improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for culturally-aware LLM deployment. This research paves the way for subsequent investigations into enhanced cultural coverage and dynamic expert adaptation, crucial for realizing autonomous AI with deeply nuanced understanding in a globally interconnected world.

Summary: 
The paper addresses the challenge of Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR) by using Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. A novel dataset is introduced for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, along with establishing baselines. The Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG) is constructed to capture methodological lineage, allowing for the identification of patterns of methodological inspiration. This approach improves recall and Mean Average Precision (mAP) significantly over strong baselines, with additional enhancements achieved through LLM-based re-ranking strategies.

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in harnessing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. While existing approaches rely on grounding the discovery process within the relevant literature, effectiveness varies significantly with the quality and nature of the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG); capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage MAG to embed an "intuitive prior" into dense retrievers for identifying patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity. This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and +4.8 in mAP. Through extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses, we exhibit the promise of MIR in enhancing automated scientific discovery and outline avenues for advancing inspiration-driven retrieval.

Summary:
This paper examines how current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) handle implicit reasoning scenarios in messy, underspecified, and unreliable real-world environments. The study evaluates six MLLMs, including o3 and GPT-4o, across four categories of real-world failure modes, finding that models often fail to detect hidden issues even when possessing the necessary skills. The research reveals that simple interventions such as cautious persona prompting and requiring a clarifying question can significantly improve model performance. While MLLMs exhibit reasoning competence, they tend to prioritize user compliance over surfacing potential flaws. This study highlights the gap between the models' reasoning abilities and their behavior in underconstrained environments, offering practical strategies to enhance their trustworthiness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in open-ended, real-world environments where inputs are messy, underspecified, and not always trustworthy. Unlike curated benchmarks, these settings frequently involve instructions that refer to missing objects or contradictory facts, rely on ambiguous references, or request infeasible actions. In such cases, success hinges not on task execution alone, but on a model's ability to detect when something is silently wrong. This paper presents a systematic analysis of how current MLLMs handle such implicit reasoning scenarios: cases where the flaw is not explicitly stated but must be inferred from context. Using a curated diagnostic suite spanning four categories of real-world failure modes, we evaluate six MLLMs, including o3 and GPT-4o, and find that models frequently fail to surface hidden issues, even when they possess the necessary perceptual and reasoning skills. Explicit prompting reveals that the underlying capabilities exist but are often suppressed in favor of user compliance. We further show that simple inference-time interventions, such as cautious persona prompting and, in particular, requiring a clarifying question, can dramatically recover performance. Our findings highlight a persistent gap between reasoning competence and behavioral compliance in current MLLMs and suggest practical strategies for making these models more trustworthy in underconstrained environments.

Abstract: Despite extensive research on the relationship between sleep and cognition, the connection between sleep microstructure and human performance across specific cognitive domains remains underexplored. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict executive functions, particularly cognitive adaptability and conceptual reasoning from physiological processes during a night's sleep. To address this, we introduce CogPSGFormer, a multi-scale convolutional-transformer model designed to process multi-modal polysomnographic data. This model integrates one-channel ECG and EEG signals along with extracted features, including EEG power bands and heart rate variability parameters, to capture complementary information across modalities. A thorough evaluation of the CogPSGFormer architecture was conducted to optimize the processing of extended sleep signals and identify the most effective configuration. The proposed framework was evaluated on 817 individuals from the STAGES dataset using cross-validation. The model achieved 80.3\% accuracy in classifying individuals into low vs. high cognitive performance groups on unseen data based on Penn Conditional Exclusion Test (PCET) scores. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our multi-scale feature extraction and multi-modal learning approach in leveraging sleep-derived signals for cognitive performance prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, our code is publicly accessible (https://github.com/boshrakh95/CogPSGFormer.git).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on a range of educational tasks, but are still understudied for their potential to solve mathematical problems. In this study, we compare three prominent LLMs, including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0, on three mathematics datasets of varying complexities (GSM8K, MATH500, and UNSW datasets). We take a five-dimensional approach based on the Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework to assess final answer correctness, step completeness, step validity, intermediate calculation accuracy, and problem comprehension. The results show that GPT-4o is the most stable and consistent in performance across all the datasets, but particularly it performs outstandingly in high-level questions of the UNSW dataset. DeepSeek-V3 is competitively strong in well-structured domains such as optimisation, but suffers from fluctuations in accuracy in statistical inference tasks. Gemini-2.0 shows strong linguistic understanding and clarity in well-structured problems but performs poorly in multi-step reasoning and symbolic logic. Our error analysis reveals particular deficits in each model: GPT-4o is at times lacking in sufficient explanation or precision; DeepSeek-V3 leaves out intermediate steps; and Gemini-2.0 is less flexible in mathematical reasoning in higher dimensions.

- Evaluation on OSWorld shows that Dyna-Think improves in-domain and out-of-domain performance while using fewer tokens compared to R1.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification, goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning (DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

<div> Interpretable reinforcement learning, BASIL, symbolic policies, quality-diversity optimization, evolutionary search<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces BASIL, a method for generating interpretable symbolic policies through online evolutionary search. Policies are represented as symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring interpretability and tractable complexity. The use of a quality-diversity archive encourages diversity among top solutions, while complexity-aware fitness promotes compact representations. Exact constraints and adaptability options allow for transparent yet expressive policies. Empirical comparisons on benchmark tasks show BASIL synthesizes compact, interpretable controllers comparable to deep reinforcement learning. This approach combines symbolic expressiveness, evolutionary diversity, and online learning in a unified framework. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2506.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for interpretable reinforcement learning is a grand challenge for the deployment of autonomous decision-making systems in safety-critical applications. Modern deep reinforcement learning approaches, while powerful, tend to produce opaque policies that compromise verification, reduce transparency, and impede human oversight. To address this, we introduce BASIL (Best-Action Symbolic Interpretable Learning), a systematic approach for generating symbolic, rule-based policies via online evolutionary search with quality-diversity (QD) optimization. BASIL represents policies as ordered lists of symbolic predicates over state variables, ensuring full interpretability and tractable policy complexity. By using a QD archive, the methodology in the proposed study encourages behavioral and structural diversity between top-performing solutions, while a complexity-aware fitness encourages the synthesis of compact representations. The evolutionary system supports the use of exact constraints for rule count and system adaptability for balancing transparency with expressiveness. Empirical comparisons with three benchmark tasks CartPole-v1, MountainCar-v0, and Acrobot-v1 show that BASIL consistently synthesizes interpretable controllers with compact representations comparable to deep reinforcement learning baselines. Herein, this article introduces a new interpretable policy synthesis method that combines symbolic expressiveness, evolutionary diversity, and online learning through a unifying framework.

<div> Keywords: artificial intelligence, olfaction, machine learning, neuroscience, ethics

Summary:<br /><br />
The article highlights the lack of attention given to olfaction in artificial intelligence (AI) research despite its importance as a high-bandwidth, evolutionarily critical sense. The exclusion of olfactory perception from AI architectures is attributed to unresolved scientific theories of smell, heterogeneous sensor technologies, lack of standardized olfactory datasets, absence of AI-oriented benchmarks, and challenges in evaluating sub-perceptual signal processing. The authors argue that integrating olfaction into AI is crucial for developing truly embodied and ethically aligned super-human intelligence. Cross-disciplinary collaboration among neuroscience, robotics, machine learning, and ethics is called for to establish olfactory benchmarks, create multimodal datasets, and define the sensory capabilities required for machines to understand and interact with human environments. Recognizing olfaction as a core modality is seen as essential for building AI systems that encompass the full scope of the human experience. <div>

Abstract: Despite extraordinary progress in artificial intelligence (AI), modern systems remain incomplete representations of human cognition. Vision, audition, and language have received disproportionate attention due to well-defined benchmarks, standardized datasets, and consensus-driven scientific foundations. In contrast, olfaction - a high-bandwidth, evolutionarily critical sense - has been largely overlooked. This omission presents a foundational gap in the construction of truly embodied and ethically aligned super-human intelligence. We argue that the exclusion of olfactory perception from AI architectures is not due to irrelevance but to structural challenges: unresolved scientific theories of smell, heterogeneous sensor technologies, lack of standardized olfactory datasets, absence of AI-oriented benchmarks, and difficulty in evaluating sub-perceptual signal processing. These obstacles have hindered the development of machine olfaction despite its tight coupling with memory, emotion, and contextual reasoning in biological systems. In this position paper, we assert that meaningful progress toward general and embodied intelligence requires serious investment in olfactory research by the AI community. We call for cross-disciplinary collaboration - spanning neuroscience, robotics, machine learning, and ethics - to formalize olfactory benchmarks, develop multimodal datasets, and define the sensory capabilities necessary for machines to understand, navigate, and act within human environments. Recognizing olfaction as a core modality is essential not only for scientific completeness, but for building AI systems that are ethically grounded in the full scope of the human experience.

<div> cognitive architecture, language models, internal reasoning, multi-turn conversation, CuRaTe benchmark

Summary:
The article introduces MIRROR, a cognitive architecture that enhances language models' capabilities through parallel reasoning inspired by human cognition. MIRROR consists of two layers: the Thinker, managing reasoning threads, and the Talker, utilizing the integrated narrative for context-aware responses. Evaluation on the CuRaTe benchmark shows up to 156% relative improvement in critical safety scenarios and an average accuracy of ~>80% across all scenarios. Models with the MIRROR architecture outperformed baseline models by 21% on average, addressing failure modes such as sycophancy and inconsistent prioritization of conflicting constraints. This work bridges cognitive science and AI by implementing modular internal reasoning, creating a persistent internal model that significantly enhances multi-turn conversation capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human intelligence relies on inner monologue to process complex information through simultaneous reflection, memory retrieval, and response formulation. We introduce MIRROR (Modular Internal Reasoning, Reflection, Orchestration, and Response), a cognitive architecture that systematically implements these parallel reasoning capabilities in large language models. MIRROR operates as a unified system with two distinct functional layers: the Thinker and the Talker. The Thinker encompasses: (1) the Inner Monologue Manager, coordinating reasoning threads across cognitive dimensions (Goals, Reasoning, and Memory); and (2) the Cognitive Controller, synthesizing these threads into a coherent internal narrative maintained across conversation turns. The Talker component then leverages this integrated narrative for context-aware responses. Evaluated on the CuRaTe benchmark--testing personalized dialogue with safety-critical constraints, conflicting preferences, and multi-turn consistency--LLMs utilizing the MIRROR architecture achieve up to 156% relative improvement in critical safety scenarios involving three persons with conflicting preferences, maintaining an average accuracy of ~>80% on all scenarios. Across scenario-specific comparisons, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Llama 4 variants, and Mistral 3 variants with the MIRROR architecture outperformed baseline models by 21% on average (15.5 percentage points absolute). MIRROR directly addresses three critical LLM failure modes: sycophancy, attentional deficits to critical information, and inconsistent prioritization of conflicting constraints. This work bridges cognitive science and AI by implementing modular internal reasoning inspired by human cognition, creating a persistent internal model that significantly enhances multi-turn conversation capabilities.

<div> robustness, AI models, monitoring, black-box, runtime<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces the concept of runtime monitoring for input-output robustness of deployed black-box AI models to enhance trustworthiness. By detecting dissimilar outputs for similar inputs during model execution, monitors can identify robustness violations. The monitoring problem is framed as fixed-radius nearest neighbor (FRNN) search, with Clemont offering lightweight monitors including online variants of FRNN algorithms and a new algorithm based on binary decision diagrams. An efficient parallelization technique is demonstrated for reducing computation time in monitors measuring input-output pair distances using the $L_\infty$ norm. Comparative studies using standard benchmarks show the effectiveness of different monitors in detecting robustness violations at runtime. This approach complements existing offline robustification methods, contributing to the overall trustworthiness of AI decision-making processes. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Input-output robustness appears in various different forms in the literature, such as robustness of AI models to adversarial or semantic perturbations and individual fairness of AI models that make decisions about humans.
  We propose runtime monitoring of input-output robustness of deployed, black-box AI models, where the goal is to design monitors that would observe one long execution sequence of the model, and would raise an alarm whenever it is detected that two similar inputs from the past led to dissimilar outputs.
  This way, monitoring will complement existing offline ``robustification'' approaches to increase the trustworthiness of AI decision-makers.
  We show that the monitoring problem can be cast as the fixed-radius nearest neighbor (FRNN) search problem, which, despite being well-studied, lacks suitable online solutions.
  We present our tool Clemont, which offers a number of lightweight monitors, some of which use upgraded online variants of existing FRNN algorithms, and one uses a novel algorithm based on binary decision diagrams -- a data-structure commonly used in software and hardware verification.
  We have also developed an efficient parallelization technique that can substantially cut down the computation time of monitors for which the distance between input-output pairs is measured using the $L_\infty$ norm.
  Using standard benchmarks from the literature of adversarial and semantic robustness and individual fairness, we perform a comparative study of different monitors in \tool, and demonstrate their effectiveness in correctly detecting robustness violations at runtime.

Abstract: Understanding urban socioeconomic conditions through visual data is a challenging yet essential task for sustainable urban development and policy planning. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{CityLens}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language-vision models (LLVMs) in predicting socioeconomic indicators from satellite and street view imagery. We construct a multi-modal dataset covering a total of 17 globally distributed cities, spanning 6 key domains: economy, education, crime, transport, health, and environment, reflecting the multifaceted nature of urban life. Based on this dataset, we define 11 prediction tasks and utilize three evaluation paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Metric Estimation, and Feature-Based Regression. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLVMs across these tasks. Our results reveal that while LLVMs demonstrate promising perceptual and reasoning capabilities, they still exhibit limitations in predicting urban socioeconomic indicators. CityLens provides a unified framework for diagnosing these limitations and guiding future efforts in using LLVMs to understand and predict urban socioeconomic patterns.

Abstract: Directly training Large Language Models (LLMs) for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) remains challenging due to intricate reward modeling, dynamic agent interactions, and demanding generalization requirements. This paper explores whether post-training techniques, specifically Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), can effectively $\textit{generalize}$ to multi-agent scenarios. We use economic reasoning as a testbed, leveraging its strong foundations in mathematics and game theory, its demand for structured analytical reasoning, and its relevance to real-world applications such as market design, resource allocation, and policy analysis. We introduce $\textbf{Recon}$ ($\textbf{R}$easoning like an $\textbf{ECON}$omist), a 7B-parameter open-source LLM post-trained on a hand-curated dataset of 2,100 high-quality economic reasoning problems. Comprehensive evaluation on economic reasoning benchmarks and multi-agent games reveals clear improvements in structured reasoning and economic rationality. These results underscore the promise of domain-aligned post-training for enhancing reasoning and agent alignment, shedding light on the roles of SFT and RL in shaping model behavior.

<title>Do Language Models Mirror Human Confidence? Exploring Psychological Insights to Address Overconfidence in LLMs</title>

<div> Keywords: LLMs, confidence estimation, overconfidence, task difficulty, interpretability

Summary: 
LLMs (Large Language Models) such as Llama-3-70B-instruct, Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o show differences from human patterns of overconfidence in performance estimation. They exhibit less sensitivity to task difficulty and display biased confidence estimations when prompted with different personas. The proposed Answer-Free Confidence Estimation (AFCE) method aims to improve confidence calibration and interpretability of LLMs by separating confidence scores and answer prompts. Experiments on MMLU and GPQA datasets demonstrate that AFCE reduces overconfidence and provides a more human-like sensitivity to task difficulty. This approach enhances the accuracy of confidence estimations in LLMs, making them more reliable in various settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Psychology research has shown that humans are poor at estimating their performance on tasks, tending towards underconfidence on easy tasks and overconfidence on difficult tasks. We examine three LLMs, Llama-3-70B-instruct, Claude-3-Sonnet, and GPT-4o, on a range of QA tasks of varying difficulty, and show that models exhibit subtle differences from human patterns of overconfidence: less sensitive to task difficulty, and when prompted to answer based on different personas -- e.g., expert vs layman, or different race, gender, and ages -- the models will respond with stereotypically biased confidence estimations even though their underlying answer accuracy remains the same. Based on these observations, we propose Answer-Free Confidence Estimation (AFCE) to improve confidence calibration and LLM interpretability in these settings. AFCE is a self-assessment method that employs two stages of prompting, first eliciting only confidence scores on questions, then asking separately for the answer. Experiments on the MMLU and GPQA datasets spanning subjects and difficulty show that this separation of tasks significantly reduces overconfidence and delivers more human-like sensitivity to task difficulty.

The article introduces the RiOSWorld benchmark, designed to assess the safety risks of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) deployed as computer-use agents in real-world scenarios. The benchmark consists of 492 risky tasks from various computer applications, categorized into user-originated and environmental risks. Safety risks are evaluated based on goal intention and completion. Experiments on RiOSWorld reveal significant safety risks faced by current computer-use agents, emphasizing the need for safety alignment in real-world computer manipulations.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), they are increasingly deployed as autonomous computer-use agents capable of accomplishing complex computer tasks. However, a pressing issue arises: Can the safety risk principles designed and aligned for general MLLMs in dialogue scenarios be effectively transferred to real-world computer-use scenarios? Existing research on evaluating the safety risks of MLLM-based computer-use agents suffers from several limitations: it either lacks realistic interactive environments, or narrowly focuses on one or a few specific risk types. These limitations ignore the complexity, variability, and diversity of real-world environments, thereby restricting comprehensive risk evaluation for computer-use agents. To this end, we introduce \textbf{RiOSWorld}, a benchmark designed to evaluate the potential risks of MLLM-based agents during real-world computer manipulations. Our benchmark includes 492 risky tasks spanning various computer applications, involving web, social media, multimedia, os, email, and office software. We categorize these risks into two major classes based on their risk source: (i) User-originated risks and (ii) Environmental risks. For the evaluation, we evaluate safety risks from two perspectives: (i) Risk goal intention and (ii) Risk goal completion. Extensive experiments with multimodal agents on \textbf{RiOSWorld} demonstrate that current computer-use agents confront significant safety risks in real-world scenarios. Our findings highlight the necessity and urgency of safety alignment for computer-use agents in real-world computer manipulation, providing valuable insights for developing trustworthy computer-use agents. Our benchmark is publicly available at https://yjyddq.github.io/RiOSWorld.github.io/.

<div> Keywords: LLM-based agents, safety evaluation, security evaluation, reasoning framework, benchmark.

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of reliably evaluating the safety and security of LLM-based agents, highlighting existing shortcomings in rule-based or LLM-based evaluators. To tackle this issue, the authors introduce a training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework called \sys. This framework enables LLM evaluators to mimic human expert evaluators by constructing an experiential memory and generating reasoning traces for past interactions. They also introduce a benchmark, \data, comprising meticulously annotated interaction records covering various risk types and scenarios. The benchmark employs "Strict" and "Lenient" judgment standards to handle ambiguous risk situations. Experimental results demonstrate that \sys significantly improves the evaluation performance of LLMs and sets a new state-of-the-art in judging agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy. The work is openly accessible. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce \sys, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. \sys constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed \data, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. \data comprises \textbf{2293} meticulously annotated interaction records, covering \textbf{15} risk types across \textbf{29} application scenarios. A key feature of \data is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing ``Strict'' and ``Lenient'' judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that \sys not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly openly accessible.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontologies are pivotal for structuring knowledge bases to enhance question answering (QA) systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, traditional ontology creation relies on manual efforts by domain experts, a process that is time intensive, error prone, and impractical for large, dynamic knowledge domains. This paper introduces OntoRAG, an automated pipeline designed to derive ontologies from unstructured knowledge bases, with a focus on electrical relay documents. OntoRAG integrates advanced techniques, including web scraping, PDF parsing, hybrid chunking, information extraction, knowledge graph construction, and ontology creation, to transform unstructured data into a queryable ontology. By leveraging LLMs and graph based methods, OntoRAG enhances global sensemaking capabilities, outperforming conventional Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG approaches in comprehensiveness and diversity. Experimental results demonstrate OntoRAGs effectiveness, achieving a comprehensiveness win rate of 85% against vector RAG and 75% against GraphRAGs best configuration. This work addresses the critical challenge of automating ontology creation, advancing the vision of the semantic web.

Summary:
DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion) is a novel approach proposed for knowledge graph completion. It overcomes the limitation of existing methods by incorporating a bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract relevant subgraphs guided by learned rules. By enhancing structural embeddings using a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter, DrKGC achieves superior performance on benchmark datasets in both general and biomedical domains. The model also offers interpretability and practical utility, as demonstrated in a case study in the biomedical domain. Overall, DrKGC effectively leverages large language models for knowledge graph completion by combining graph structure perception and reasoning with textual information. <div>
arXiv:2506.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

Summary:<br />Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) emphasize the importance of aligning their behaviors with human values. This study addresses the issue of preference deviation in LLMs, where their stated preferences may not align with their revealed preferences in contextualized scenarios. A method to measure this deviation is proposed, using a dataset of well-designed prompts to compare LLM responses to general principle prompts and contextualized prompts. The analysis shows that minor changes in prompt format can significantly alter LLM decisions, highlighting a lack of understanding and control over their decision-making competence. This has implications for the interpretability, trustworthiness, and ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. Understanding and addressing preference deviation in LLMs will be crucial for integrating them into services that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness, and social responsibilities are important considerations. Identifying such deviations will be essential as LLMs are increasingly used for autonomous tasks without continuous human evaluation. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) highlight the need to align their behaviors with human values. A critical, yet understudied, issue is the potential divergence between an LLM's stated preferences (its reported alignment with general principles) and its revealed preferences (inferred from decisions in contextualized scenarios). Such deviations raise fundamental concerns for the interpretability, trustworthiness, reasoning transparency, and ethical deployment of LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications. This work formally defines and proposes a method to measure this preference deviation. We investigate how LLMs may activate different guiding principles in specific contexts, leading to choices that diverge from previously stated general principles. Our approach involves crafting a rich dataset of well-designed prompts as a series of forced binary choices and presenting them to LLMs. We compare LLM responses to general principle prompts stated preference with LLM responses to contextualized prompts revealed preference, using metrics like KL divergence to quantify the deviation. We repeat the analysis across different categories of preferences and on four mainstream LLMs and find that a minor change in prompt format can often pivot the preferred choice regardless of the preference categories and LLMs in the test. This prevalent phenomenon highlights the lack of understanding and control of the LLM decision-making competence. Our study will be crucial for integrating LLMs into services, especially those that interact directly with humans, where morality, fairness, and social responsibilities are crucial dimensions. Furthermore, identifying or being aware of such deviation will be critically important as LLMs are increasingly envisioned for autonomous agentic tasks where continuous human evaluation of all LLMs' intermediary decision-making steps is impossible.

Abstract: Accurate house-price forecasting is essential for investors, planners, and researchers. However, reproducible benchmarks with sufficient spatiotemporal depth and contextual richness for long horizon prediction remain scarce. To address this, we introduce HouseTS a large scale, multimodal dataset covering monthly house prices from March 2012 to December 2023 across 6,000 ZIP codes in 30 major U.S. metropolitan areas. The dataset includes over 890K records, enriched with points of Interest (POI), socioeconomic indicators, and detailed real estate metrics. To establish standardized performance baselines, we evaluate 14 models, spanning classical statistical approaches, deep neural networks (DNNs), and pretrained time-series foundation models. We further demonstrate the value of HouseTS in a multimodal case study, where a vision language model extracts structured textual descriptions of geographic change from time stamped satellite imagery. This enables interpretable, grounded insights into urban evolution. HouseTS is hosted on Kaggle, while all preprocessing pipelines, benchmark code, and documentation are openly maintained on GitHub to ensure full reproducibility and easy adoption.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, uncertainty, ConfuseBench, document scarcity, query ambiguity

Summary: 

Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used but often struggle with overconfidence in uncertain scenarios. Existing solutions tend to provide evasive responses, such as "I don't know," instead of addressing the root cause of uncertainty. To address this issue, this paper introduces ConfuseBench, a benchmark focused on document scarcity, limited capability, and query ambiguity. Experiments show that current LLMs have difficulty accurately identifying and resolving uncertainty, often attributing it to query ambiguity while ignoring capability limitations. The authors propose generating context-aware inquiries to highlight confusing aspects of queries and use an on-policy training method, InteractDPO, to improve inquiries. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in helping LLMs recognize and address sources of uncertainty. <div>

Abstract: Despite the widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various domains, they frequently exhibit overconfidence when encountering uncertain scenarios, yet existing solutions primarily rely on evasive responses (e.g., "I don't know") overlooks the opportunity of identifying and addressing the uncertainty to generate more satisfactory responses. To systematically investigate and improve LLMs' ability of recognizing and addressing the source of uncertainty, we introduce \textbf{ConfuseBench}, a benchmark mainly focus on three types of uncertainty: document scarcity, limited capability, and query ambiguity. Experiments with ConfuseBench reveal that current LLMs struggle to accurately identify the root cause of uncertainty and solve it. They prefer to attribute uncertainty to query ambiguity while overlooking capability limitations, especially for those weaker models. To tackle this challenge, we first generate context-aware inquiries that highlight the confusing aspect of the original query. Then we judge the source of uncertainty based on the uniqueness of the inquiry's answer. Further we use an on-policy training method, InteractDPO to generate better inquiries. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, red-teaming, jailbreak attacks, Composition-of-Principles framework, automated discovery

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen significant advancements, leading to transformative applications across various domains. However, emerging concerns about jailbreak attacks, which exploit LLMs to produce harmful responses, highlight the need for proactive risk assessment. This paper introduces an innovative approach, the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, to automate and scale the red-teaming process for LLMs. By integrating human-provided red-teaming principles, the CoP framework orchestrates effective strategies to identify and generate jailbreak prompts. In testing against prominent LLMs, CoP uncovers unprecedented safety risks, detecting novel jailbreak prompts and significantly enhancing single-turn attack success rates up to 19 times. This framework not only enhances security measures but also facilitates the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies, bolstering defenses against potential risks in the frontier of AI technology.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred transformative applications in various domains, ranging from open-source to proprietary LLMs. However, jailbreak attacks, which aim to break safety alignment and user compliance by tricking the target LLMs into answering harmful and risky responses, are becoming an urgent concern. The practice of red-teaming for LLMs is to proactively explore potential risks and error-prone instances before the release of frontier AI technology. This paper proposes an agentic workflow to automate and scale the red-teaming process of LLMs through the Composition-of-Principles (CoP) framework, where human users provide a set of red-teaming principles as instructions to an AI agent to automatically orchestrate effective red-teaming strategies and generate jailbreak prompts. Distinct from existing red-teaming methods, our CoP framework provides a unified and extensible framework to encompass and orchestrate human-provided red-teaming principles to enable the automated discovery of new red-teaming strategies. When tested against leading LLMs, CoP reveals unprecedented safety risks by finding novel jailbreak prompts and improving the best-known single-turn attack success rate by up to 19.0 times.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in power and influence, ensuring their safety and preventing harmful output becomes critical. Automated red teaming serves as a tool to detect security vulnerabilities in LLMs without manual labor. However, most existing methods struggle to balance the effectiveness and diversity of red-team generated attack prompts. To address this challenge, we propose \ourapproach, a novel automated red teaming training framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to explore and generate more effective attack prompts while balancing their diversity. Specifically, it consists of three training stages: (1) Cold Start: The red team model is supervised and fine-tuned on a jailbreak dataset obtained through imitation learning. (2) Warm-up Exploration: The model is trained in jailbreak instruction following and exploration, using diversity and consistency as reward signals. (3) Enhanced Jailbreak: Progressive jailbreak rewards are introduced to gradually enhance the jailbreak performance of the red-team model. Extensive experiments on a variety of LLMs show that \ourapproach effectively balances the diversity and effectiveness of jailbreak prompts compared to existing methods. Our work significantly improves the efficiency of red team exploration and provides a new perspective on automated red teaming.

Summary:
GeoChain is a new large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). This benchmark pairs 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images with a 21-step chain-of-thought question sequence, resulting in over 30 million Q&amp;A pairs. The benchmark covers four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are enriched with semantic segmentation and a visual locatability score. Evaluation of current MLLMs on a subset of 2,088 images revealed consistent challenges, including weaknesses in visual grounding, erratic reasoning, and difficulties in accurate localization as reasoning complexity increased. GeoChain provides a valuable diagnostic methodology for advancing geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million Q&amp;A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5 variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning, and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within MLLMs.

Summary:
A new benchmark is introduced for predicting the success of AI research ideas, aiming to accelerate empirical AI research. The system combines a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent and outperforms human experts in the NLP domain. With an accuracy of 77%, the system proves successful in predicting the performance of research ideas. Superficial features are ruled out as the basis for predictions through robustness tests. The system also demonstrates potential as a reward model for improving idea generation models, achieving 63.6% accuracy on unpublished novel ideas, including those generated by an AI ideation agent. This study suggests a promising new approach for leveraging language models to enhance the pace and outcomes of empirical AI research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many promising-looking ideas in AI research fail to deliver, but their validation takes substantial human labor and compute. Predicting an idea's chance of success is thus crucial for accelerating empirical AI research, a skill that even expert researchers can only acquire through substantial experience. We build the first benchmark for this task and compare LMs with human experts. Concretely, given two research ideas (e.g., two jailbreaking methods), we aim to predict which will perform better on a set of benchmarks. We scrape ideas and experimental results from conference papers, yielding 1,585 human-verified idea pairs published after our base model's cut-off date for testing, and 6,000 pairs for training. We then develop a system that combines a fine-tuned GPT-4.1 with a paper retrieval agent, and we recruit 25 human experts to compare with. In the NLP domain, our system beats human experts by a large margin (64.4% v.s. 48.9%). On the full test set, our system achieves 77% accuracy, while off-the-shelf frontier LMs like o3 perform no better than random guessing, even with the same retrieval augmentation. We verify that our system does not exploit superficial features like idea complexity through extensive human-written and LM-designed robustness tests. Finally, we evaluate our system on unpublished novel ideas, including ideas generated by an AI ideation agent. Our system achieves 63.6% accuracy, demonstrating its potential as a reward model for improving idea generation models. Altogether, our results outline a promising new direction for LMs to accelerate empirical AI research.

<div> reasoning capabilities, large language models, time series classification, ReasonTSC, multi-turn reasoning

Summary:
ReasonTSC introduces a novel framework for leveraging large language models' reasoning capabilities in time series classification tasks. The framework employs a multi-turn reasoning approach and a fused decision-making strategy specifically tailored to time series data. Unlike existing methods, ReasonTSC prompts the model to contemplate the essential features of time series data before integrating predictions from plug-in classifiers. It guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process, evaluating initial assessments, exploring alternative hypotheses, and comparing their merits to reach a final classification. Experimental results and ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms existing baselines and plug-in models. The framework can also identify and rectify false predictions made by plug-in models, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing time series classification performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced their performance by enabling in-depth understanding of diverse tasks. With growing interest in applying LLMs to the time series domain, this has proven nontrivial, as evidenced by the limited efficacy of straightforwardly adapting text-domain reasoning techniques. Although recent work has shown promise in several time series tasks, further leveraging advancements in LLM reasoning remains under-explored for time series classification (TSC) tasks, despite their prevalence and significance in many real-world applications. In this paper, we propose ReasonTSC, a novel framework designed to effectively leverage LLM reasoning for time series classification through both a multi-turn reasoning and a fused decision-making strategy tailored to TSC. Rather than straightforwardly applying existing reasoning techniques or relying solely on LLMs' built-in reasoning capabilities, ReasonTSC first steers the model to think over the essential characteristics of time series data. Next, it integrates predictions and confidence scores from plug-in classifiers, e.g., domain-specific time series models, as in-context examples. Finally, ReasonTSC guides the LLM through a structured reasoning process: it evaluates the initial assessment, backtracks to consider alternative hypotheses, and compares their merits before arriving at a final classification. Extensive experiments and systematic ablation studies demonstrate that ReasonTSC consistently outperforms both existing time series reasoning baselines and plug-in models, and is even capable of identifying and correcting plug-in models' false predictions.

Summary:
Preference learning is utilized to enhance fine-grained video captioning by addressing limitations of direct preference optimization (DPO). A pipeline is proposed to construct preference pairs efficiently, balancing cost and data quality. Synergistic Preference Optimization (SynPO) is introduced as a novel method that surpasses DPO by preventing negative preferences from dominating optimization and maintaining the model's language capability. SynPO eliminates the need for a reference model, improving training efficiency by 20%. Evaluations on video captioning benchmarks and NLP tasks show consistent performance gains across diverse pretrained models. The code for SynPO is available for public use on GitHub.

Abstract: Fine-grained video captioning aims to generate detailed, temporally coherent descriptions of video content. However, existing methods struggle to capture subtle video dynamics and rich detailed information. In this paper, we leverage preference learning to enhance the performance of vision-language models in fine-grained video captioning, while mitigating several limitations inherent to direct preference optimization (DPO). First, we propose a pipeline for constructing preference pairs that leverages the intrinsic properties of VLMs along with partial assistance from large language models, achieving an optimal balance between cost and data quality. Second, we propose Synergistic Preference Optimization (SynPO), a novel optimization method offering significant advantages over DPO and its variants. SynPO prevents negative preferences from dominating the optimization, explicitly preserves the model's language capability to avoid deviation of the optimization objective, and improves training efficiency by eliminating the need for the reference model. We extensively evaluate SynPO not only on video captioning benchmarks (e.g., VDC, VDD, VATEX) but also across well-established NLP tasks, including general language understanding and preference evaluation, using diverse pretrained models. Results demonstrate that SynPO consistently outperforms DPO variants while achieving 20\% improvement in training efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/longmalongma/SynPO

Abstract: The accelerating development of general medical artificial intelligence (GMAI), powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offers transformative potential for addressing persistent healthcare challenges, including workforce deficits and escalating costs. The parallel development of systematic evaluation benchmarks emerges as a critical imperative to enable performance assessment and provide technological guidance. Meanwhile, as an invaluable knowledge source, the potential of medical textbooks for benchmark development remains underexploited. Here, we present MedBookVQA, a systematic and comprehensive multimodal benchmark derived from open-access medical textbooks. To curate this benchmark, we propose a standardized pipeline for automated extraction of medical figures while contextually aligning them with corresponding medical narratives. Based on this curated data, we generate 5,000 clinically relevant questions spanning modality recognition, disease classification, anatomical identification, symptom diagnosis, and surgical procedures. A multi-tier annotation system categorizes queries through hierarchical taxonomies encompassing medical imaging modalities (42 categories), body anatomies (125 structures), and clinical specialties (31 departments), enabling nuanced analysis across medical subdomains. We evaluate a wide array of MLLMs, including proprietary, open-sourced, medical, and reasoning models, revealing significant performance disparities across task types and model categories. Our findings highlight critical capability gaps in current GMAI systems while establishing textbook-derived multimodal benchmarks as essential evaluation tools. MedBookVQA establishes textbook-derived benchmarking as a critical paradigm for advancing clinical AI, exposing limitations in GMAI systems while providing anatomically structured performance metrics across specialties.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) extracts emotions from multimodal data, including visual, speech, and text inputs, playing a key role in human-computer interaction. Attention-based fusion methods dominate MER research, achieving strong classification performance. However, two key challenges remain: effectively extracting modality-specific features and capturing cross-modal similarities despite distribution differences caused by modality heterogeneity. To address these, we propose a gated interactive attention mechanism to adaptively extract modality-specific features while enhancing emotional information through pairwise interactions. Additionally, we introduce a modality-invariant generator to learn modality-invariant representations and constrain domain shifts by aligning cross-modal similarities. Experiments on IEMOCAP demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art MER approaches, achieving WA 80.7% and UA 81.3%.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models (LLMs), epistemic framework, autonomy, decision-making, knowledge boundary

Summary: 
Agents require a coherent epistemic framework to govern their knowledge and decision-making processes. This framework treats internal reasoning and external actions as equivalent tools, allowing for systematic coordination of introspection and interaction. By aligning an agent's tool use decision-making boundary with its knowledge boundary, unnecessary tool use is minimized and epistemic efficiency is maximized. This perspective shifts the design of agents towards knowledge-driven intelligence systems, enabling adaptive, efficient, and goal-directed behavior. This approach aims to create foundation agents capable of autonomous decision-making and effectively acquiring knowledge for optimal performance. <div>
arXiv:2506.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve into increasingly autonomous agents, fundamental questions about their epistemic foundations remain unresolved: What defines an agent? How should it make decisions? And what objectives should guide its behavior? In this position paper, we argue that true autonomy requires agents to be grounded in a coherent epistemic framework that governs what they know, what they need to know, and how to acquire that knowledge efficiently. We propose a unified theory that treats internal reasoning and external actions as equivalent epistemic tools, enabling agents to systematically coordinate introspection and interaction. Building on this framework, we advocate for aligning an agent's tool use decision-making boundary with its knowledge boundary, thereby minimizing unnecessary tool use and maximizing epistemic efficiency. This perspective shifts the design of agents from mere action executors to knowledge-driven intelligence systems, offering a principled path toward building foundation agents capable of adaptive, efficient, and goal-directed behavior.

Summary: Conformal Arbitrage introduces a framework for managing competing objectives in modern language model deployments. By learning a data-driven threshold, it mediates between a Primary model optimized for a primary objective and a Guardian model aligned with a guardrail objective. The framework uses conformal risk control to ensure that the frequency of undesirable events stays within user-specified limits. Operating at the API level, without accessing model logits or updating weights, Conformal Arbitrage complements weight-based alignment techniques. It outperforms random routing between models in terms of accuracy, providing a practical and theoretically grounded approach for deploying large language models effectively across a range of objectives. <br /><br />Summary: They introduce Conformal Arbitrage for modern language model deployments that balances competing objectives by learning a threshold calibrated with conformal risk control. It complements existing techniques and outperforms random routing, making it a practical tool for deploying large language models effectively. <div>
arXiv:2506.00911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern language model deployments must often balance competing objectives, for example, helpfulness versus harmlessness, cost versus accuracy, and reward versus safety. We introduce Conformal Arbitrage, a post hoc framework that learns a data driven threshold to mediate between a Primary model optimized for a primary objective and a more conservative Guardian which could be another model or a human domain expert aligned with a guardrail objective. The threshold is calibrated with conformal risk control, yielding finite sample, distribution free guarantees that the long run frequency of undesirable events, such as factual errors or safety violations, does not exceed a user specified quota. Because Conformal Arbitrage operates wholly at the API level, without requiring access to model logits or updating model weights, it complements weight based alignment techniques and integrates seamlessly with existing cost aware cascades. Empirically, Conformal Arbitrage traces an efficient frontier, allowing users to define an acceptable performance level for one objective while maximizing utility in another. We observe that our method outperforms, in terms of accuracy, cost matched random routing between models. These properties make Conformal Arbitrage a practical, theoretically grounded tool for trustworthy and economical deployment of large language models across a broad range of potentially competing objectives.

Vision-language models that are aligned with individual cognitive preferences are becoming essential in assisting with visual tasks, but personalized expectations for these models vary among individuals based on their Role-Sets. To address this, a benchmark called PCogAlignBench has been created with 18k instances and 20 individuals, each with different Role-Sets. The framework PCogAlign has been proposed to construct a cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment. Experimental results and human evaluations have validated the effectiveness of PCogAlign. The code and benchmark will be made available at https://github.com/NLPGM/PCogAlign.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then, we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will open-source the constructed benchmark and code at https://github.com/NLPGM/PCogAlign.

MARS is a multimodal language model that incorporates nonverbal cues into text, enhancing conversational AI. The model utilizes the VENUS dataset, which includes annotated videos with text, facial expressions, and body language. MARS is trained using a next-token prediction objective, combining text with nonverbal representations for a comprehensive understanding. The VENUS dataset is shown to be large-scale and effective through various analyses. MARS successfully generates both text and nonverbal languages in response to conversational input. The integration of nonverbal cues into language models like MARS opens up new possibilities for creating more immersive conversational experiences.

Abstract: Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures, facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully immersive conversational experiences. We introduce MARS, a multimodal language model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text, bridging this gap in conversational AI. Our key innovation is VENUS, a large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a unified framework. Based on various analyses of the VENUS datasets, we validate its substantial scale and high effectiveness. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that MARS successfully generates text and nonverbal languages, corresponding to conversational input.

Summary: 
The article introduces FLEx, a novel federated learning framework designed specifically for MoE-based large language models. FLEx addresses the challenges of existing FL approaches by efficiently personalizing MoE models through expert pruning and adaptive gating mechanisms. This allows for personalized knowledge sharing while minimizing communication overhead and computational costs. FLEx outperforms current federated baselines in evaluations on various instruction-based datasets under non-IID conditions. The shared modules are aggregated globally, while personalized experts are trained locally and stored on each client, ensuring the original MoE architecture remains unchanged. The code for FLEx is available online for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a prominent strategy for scaling large language models (LLMs), effectively leveraging sparse activation and facilitating task-specific personalization. However, current federated learning (FL) approaches are primarily designed for dense models, making them unable to directly exploit the sparsity inherent in MoE architectures. Treating MoE models as dense networks in federated scenarios results in excessive communication overhead and computational costs, undermining the potential for personalized knowledge sharing. To address these challenges, we propose FLEx (Federated LLMs with Personalized Experts), a novel federated learning framework explicitly tailored for MoE-based LLMs. FLEx efficiently personalizes by pruning the global MoE model to keep only one expert per client, and employs an adaptive gating mechanism to reintegrate these personalized experts into the pre-trained MoE layers, ensuring the original backbone architecture remains unchanged. These personalized experts are trained with local data and stored locally on each client, while the shared modules are aggregated globally. Extensive evaluations on diverse instruction-based datasets under non-IID conditions consistently demonstrate that FLEx outperforms existing federated baselines. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FLEx-8F12.

<div> keywords: Word Sense Disambiguation, BERT, PolyBERT, multi-head attention, Batch Contrastive Learning

Summary:
PolyBERT, a poly-encoder BERT-based model, addresses limitations in previous Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods by balancing token-level and sequence-level semantics and reducing computational costs. The model utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to fuse local and global semantics, enhancing semantic representation. Batch Contrastive Learning (BCL) is introduced to reduce redundant training inputs by using correct senses of other target words in the same batch as negative samples. Experimental results show that PolyBERT outperforms baseline WSD methods like Huang's GlossBERT and Blevins's BEM, achieving a 2% higher F1-score. Additionally, PolyBERT with BCL reduces GPU hours by 37.6% compared to PolyBERT without BCL.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mainstream Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) approaches have employed BERT to extract semantics from both context and definitions of senses to determine the most suitable sense of a target word, achieving notable performance. However, there are two limitations in these approaches. First, previous studies failed to balance the representation of token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics during feature extraction, leading to insufficient semantic representation and a performance bottleneck. Second, these approaches incorporated all possible senses of each target word during the training phase, leading to unnecessary computational costs. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a poly-encoder BERT-based model with batch contrastive learning for WSD, named PolyBERT. Compared with previous WSD methods, PolyBERT has two improvements: (1) A poly-encoder with a multi-head attention mechanism is utilized to fuse token-level (local) and sequence-level (global) semantics, rather than focusing on just one. This approach enriches semantic representation by balancing local and global semantics. (2) To avoid redundant training inputs, Batch Contrastive Learning (BCL) is introduced. BCL utilizes the correct senses of other target words in the same batch as negative samples for the current target word, which reduces training inputs and computational cost. The experimental results demonstrate that PolyBERT outperforms baseline WSD methods such as Huang's GlossBERT and Blevins's BEM by 2\% in F1-score. In addition, PolyBERT with BCL reduces GPU hours by 37.6\% compared with PolyBERT without BCL.

<div> Keywords: social media bots, graph-based detection, generative self-supervised learning, heterophily-aware representation learning, bot detection benchmarks

Summary: 
BotHP introduces a novel generative Graph Self-Supervised Learning framework for enhancing graph-based bot detection methods. It addresses the limitations of existing approaches by combining homophily and heterophily-aware representation learning, capturing global graph patterns effectively. BotHP utilizes a dual-encoder architecture incorporating both graph-aware and graph-agnostic encoders to model node commonality and uniqueness simultaneously, improving detection performance. Furthermore, it introduces a prototype-guided cluster discovery pretext task to identify dispersed yet semantically aligned bot collectives, enhancing detection accuracy and generalization capability. Experimental results on two real-world bot detection benchmarks demonstrate BotHP's effectiveness in improving detection performance, reducing label reliance, and enhancing generalization across diverse communities. The framework shows promise in countering challenges like interaction camouflage and distributed bot deployment, making it a valuable tool for maintaining the security and trustworthiness of social networks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Detecting social media bots is essential for maintaining the security and trustworthiness of social networks. While contemporary graph-based detection methods demonstrate promising results, their practical application is limited by label reliance and poor generalization capability across diverse communities. Generative Graph Self-Supervised Learning (GSL) presents a promising paradigm to overcome these limitations, yet existing approaches predominantly follow the homophily assumption and fail to capture the global patterns in the graph, which potentially diminishes their effectiveness when facing the challenges of interaction camouflage and distributed deployment in bot detection scenarios. To this end, we propose BotHP, a generative GSL framework tailored to boost graph-based bot detectors through heterophily-aware representation learning and prototype-guided cluster discovery. Specifically, BotHP leverages a dual-encoder architecture, consisting of a graph-aware encoder to capture node commonality and a graph-agnostic encoder to preserve node uniqueness. This enables the simultaneous modeling of both homophily and heterophily, effectively countering the interaction camouflage issue. Additionally, BotHP incorporates a prototype-guided cluster discovery pretext task to model the latent global consistency of bot clusters and identify spatially dispersed yet semantically aligned bot collectives. Extensive experiments on two real-world bot detection benchmarks demonstrate that BotHP consistently boosts graph-based bot detectors, improving detection performance, alleviating label reliance, and enhancing generalization capability.

Summary:  
The paper discusses the concept of individual responsibility in group decision-making scenarios, highlighting the limitations of Frankfurt's principle of alternative possibilities in such settings. It addresses the issue of a "responsibility gap'' that arises when assigning responsibility in group contexts. Two approaches to mitigate this gap are examined: group responsibility and higher-order responsibility. The research delves into determining the adequacy of higher-order responsibility up to a certain degree, presenting a technical result that shows this problem is classified as $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete. This analysis sheds light on the complexities of assigning and distributing responsibility within group dynamics, offering insights into the challenges of defining responsibility in collaborative decision-making processes. <div>

Abstract: In ethics, individual responsibility is often defined through Frankfurt's principle of alternative possibilities. This definition is not adequate in a group decision-making setting because it often results in the lack of a responsible party or "responsibility gap''. One of the existing approaches to address this problem is to consider group responsibility. Another, recently proposed, approach is "higher-order'' responsibility. The paper considers the problem of deciding if higher-order responsibility up to degree $d$ is enough to close the responsibility gap. The main technical result is that this problem is $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete.

Summary: 
The article introduces IRT-Router, a framework for efficiently routing user queries to the most suitable Large Language Model (LLM) based on a balance of performance and cost considerations. Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), the framework models the relationship between LLM capabilities and query attributes. It provides accurate prediction of response performance and offers interpretable insights into LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, an online query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity enhances the online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on multiple LLMs and datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness and interpretability of IRT-Router compared to baseline methods. The framework also shows reliable performance in cold-start scenarios, highlighting its practicality for real-world applications. The code for IRT-Router is available on GitHub. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across a wide range of natural language tasks. However, selecting the optimal LLM to respond to a user query often necessitates a delicate balance between performance and cost. While powerful models deliver better results, they come at a high cost, whereas smaller models are more cost-effective but less capable. To address this trade-off, we propose IRT-Router, a multi-LLM routing framework that efficiently routes user queries to the most suitable LLM. Inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), a psychological measurement methodology, IRT-Router explicitly models the relationship between LLM capabilities and user query attributes. This not only enables accurate prediction of response performance but also provides interpretable insights, such as LLM abilities and query difficulty. Additionally, we design an online query warm-up technique based on semantic similarity, further enhancing the online generalization capability of IRT-Router. Extensive experiments on 20 LLMs and 12 datasets demonstrate that IRT-Router outperforms most baseline methods in terms of effectiveness and interpretability. Its superior performance in cold-start scenarios further confirms the reliability and practicality of IRT-Router in real-world applications.

<div> framework, large language models, toolchain, tool retrieval, model-context protocol

Summary:
The MCP-Zero framework introduces a proactive agent framework for large language models, allowing them to decide when and which external tools to retrieve for task-specific toolchains. It comprises three components: Proactive Tool Request, Hierarchical Vector Routing, and Iterative Proactive Invocation. By emitting structured requests and using a coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm, the framework minimizes context overhead and accurately selects tools from a large pool. Experiments show significant token consumption reduction while maintaining high accuracy on the APIbank dataset. Multi-turn tool invocation is supported with consistent accuracy across rounds. The MCP-tools dataset, comprising 308 servers and nearly 3,000 tools, was created to evaluate the approach. The code and dataset will be made available soon. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2506.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Function-calling has enabled large language models (LLMs) to act as tool-using agents, but injecting thousands of tool schemas into the prompt is costly and error-prone. We introduce MCP-Zero, a proactive agent framework that lets the LLM itself decide when and which external tools to retrieve, thereby assembling a task-specific toolchain from scratch. The framework is built upon three components: (1) Proactive Tool Request, where the model emits a structured $\left<\operatorname{tool\_assistant}\right>$ block that explicitly specifies the desired server and task; (2) Hierarchical Vector Routing, a coarse-to-fine retrieval algorithm that first selects candidate servers and then ranks tools within each server based on the semantic similarity; (3) Iterative Proactive Invocation, enabling multi-round, cross-domain toolchain construction with minimal context overhead, and allowing the model to iteratively revise its request when the returned tools are insufficient. To evaluate our approach we also compile MCP-tools, a retrieval dataset comprising 308 MCP servers and 2,797 tools extracted from the official Model-Context-Protocol repository and normalized into a unified JSON schema. Experiments show that MCP-Zero (i) effectively addresses the context overhead problem of existing methods and accurately selects the correct tool from a pool of nearly 3,000 candidates (248.1k tokens); (ii) reduces token consumption by 98\% on the APIbank while maintaining high accuracy; and (iii) supports multi-turn tool invocation with consistent accuracy across rounds. The code and dataset will be released soon.

<div> Keywords: AI Alignment, Multi-Agent Systems, Social Environment, Human Values, Simulation<br />
Summary: <br />
- AI Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is a dynamic process influenced by the social environment in which agents operate, whether collaborative, cooperative, or competitive.<br />
- The prevalence of MAS in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that affects how agents pursue goals and interact with each other.<br />
- Agents must coordinate to achieve individual and collective goals, but social structures can lead to misalignment with human values and preferences.<br />
- Social sciences can provide insights into how social organization may affect individual and group values.<br />
- The AI community should consider human, preferential, and objective alignment as interconnected issues and develop simulation environments and evaluation frameworks to assess alignment in interactive multi-agent contexts.<br /> <div>

Abstract: This position paper states that AI Alignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) should be considered a dynamic and interaction-dependent process that heavily depends on the social environment where agents are deployed, either collaborative, cooperative, or competitive. While AI alignment with human values and preferences remains a core challenge, the growing prevalence of MAS in real-world applications introduces a new dynamic that reshapes how agents pursue goals and interact to accomplish various tasks. As agents engage with one another, they must coordinate to accomplish both individual and collective goals. However, this complex social organization may unintentionally misalign some or all of these agents with human values or user preferences. Drawing on social sciences, we analyze how social structure can deter or shatter group and individual values. Based on these analyses, we call on the AI community to treat human, preferential, and objective alignment as an interdependent concept, rather than isolated problems. Finally, we emphasize the urgent need for simulation environments, benchmarks, and evaluation frameworks that allow researchers to assess alignment in these interactive multi-agent contexts before such dynamics grow too complex to control.

<title>Choices and their Provenance: Explaining Stable Solutions of Abstract Argumentation Frameworks</title>

Abstract: The rule $\mathrm{Defeated}(x) \leftarrow \mathrm{Attacks}(y,x),\, \neg \, \mathrm{Defeated}(y)$, evaluated under the well-founded semantics (WFS), yields a unique 3-valued (skeptical) solution of an abstract argumentation framework (AF). An argument $x$ is defeated ($\mathrm{OUT}$) if there exists an undefeated argument $y$ that attacks it. For 2-valued (stable) solutions, this is the case iff $y$ is accepted ($\mathrm{IN}$), i.e., if all of $y$'s attackers are defeated. Under WFS, arguments that are neither accepted nor defeated are undecided ($\mathrm{UNDEC}$). As shown in prior work, well-founded solutions (a.k.a. grounded labelings) "explain themselves": The provenance of arguments is given by subgraphs (definable via regular path queries) rooted at the node of interest. This provenance is closely related to winning strategies of a two-player argumentation game.
  We present a novel approach for extending this provenance to stable AF solutions. Unlike grounded solutions, which can be constructed via a bottom-up alternating fixpoint procedure, stable models often involve non-deterministic choice as part of the search for models. Thus, the provenance of stable solutions is of a different nature, and reflects a more expressive generate & test paradigm. Our approach identifies minimal sets of critical attacks, pinpointing choices and assumptions made by a stable model. These critical attack edges provide additional insights into the provenance of an argument's status, combining well-founded derivation steps with choice steps. Our approach can be understood as a form of diagnosis that finds minimal "repairs" to an AF graph such that the well-founded solution of the repaired graph coincides with the desired stable model of the original AF graph.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time transaction monitoring framework that integrates graph-based modeling, narrative field embedding, and generative explanation to support automated financial compliance. The system constructs dynamic transaction graphs, extracts structural and contextual features, and classifies suspicious behavior using a graph neural network. A retrieval-augmented generation module generates natural language explanations aligned with regulatory clauses for each flagged transaction. Experiments conducted on a simulated stream of financial data show that the proposed method achieves superior results, with 98.2% F1-score, 97.8% precision, and 97.0% recall. Expert evaluation further confirms the quality and interpretability of generated justifications. The findings demonstrate the potential of combining graph intelligence and generative models to support explainable, audit-ready compliance in high-risk financial environments.

Abstract: Sustaining coherent, role-aware communication across multi-agent systems remains a foundational challenge in AI. Current frameworks often lack explicit mechanisms for speaker responsibility, leading to context drift, alignment instability, and degraded interpretability over time. We propose the Modular Speaker Architecture (MSA), a framework that decomposes speaker behavior into modular components for role tracking, responsibility continuity, and contextual coherence. Grounded in high-context human-AI dialogues, MSA includes three core modules: a Speaker Role Module, a Responsibility Chain Tracker, and a Contextual Integrity Validator. We evaluate MSA through annotated case studies and introduce structural metrics-pragmatic consistency, responsibility flow, and context stability-quantified via manual and automatic scoring and bootstrapped statistical analysis. Our results show that MSA reliably maintains interaction structure without reliance on affective signals or surface-level heuristics. We further implement a prototype configuration language (G-Code) and modular API to support MSA deployment in dynamic multi-agent scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for complex reasoning tasks where high-quality offline data such as expert-annotated solutions and distilled reasoning traces are often available. However, in environments with sparse rewards, reinforcement learning struggles to sample successful trajectories, leading to inefficient learning. At the same time, these offline trajectories that represent correct reasoning paths are not utilized by standard on-policy reinforcement learning methods. To address this limitation, we propose SuperRL, a unified training framework that adaptively incorporates offline supervision into reinforcement learning. SuperRL introduces an Adaptive Switch to detect sparse reward conditions and activates a Hybrid Actor when necessary. The Hybrid Actor integrates policy gradient and supervised learning objectives at the loss level, enabling the model to benefit from accurate offline reasoning signals while maintaining the exploratory capacity of reinforcement learning. Experiments on a range of reasoning benchmarks show that SuperRL consistently outperforms standard reinforcement learning by improving sample efficiency, generalization, and robustness under sparse rewards.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used across various scenarios due to their exceptional reasoning capabilities and natural language understanding. While LLMs demonstrate strong performance in tasks involving mathematics and coding, their effectiveness diminishes significantly when applied to chemistry-related problems. Chemistry problems typically involve long and complex reasoning steps, which contain specific terminology, including specialized symbol systems and complex nomenclature conventions. These characteristics often cause general LLMs to experience hallucinations during the reasoning process due to their lack of specific knowledge. However, existing methods are struggling to effectively leverage chemical expertise and formulas. Moreover, current uncertainty estimation methods, designed to mitigate potential reasoning errors, are unable to precisely identify specific steps or key knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel framework called ChemAU, which incorporates our adaptive uncertainty estimation method that applies different uncertainty values based on the position of reasoning steps within the whole reasoning chain. Leveraging this method, ChemAU identifies gaps in chemistry knowledge and precisely supplements chemical expertise with the specialized domain model, thereby correcting and updating the previously flawed reasoning chain. Our experiments with three popular LLMs across three chemistry datasets demonstrate that ChemAU significantly enhances both reasoning accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Structured scene representations are a core component of embodied agents, helping to consolidate raw sensory streams into readable, modular, and searchable formats. Due to their high computational overhead, many approaches build such representations in advance of the task. However, when the task specifications change, such static approaches become inadequate as they may miss key objects, spatial relations, and details. We introduce GraphPad, a modifiable structured memory that an agent can tailor to the needs of the task through API calls. It comprises a mutable scene graph representing the environment, a navigation log indexing frame-by-frame content, and a scratchpad for task-specific notes. Together, GraphPad serves as a dynamic workspace that remains complete, current, and aligned with the agent's immediate understanding of the scene and its task. On the OpenEQA benchmark, GraphPad attains 55.3%, a +3.0% increase over an image-only baseline using the same vision-language model, while operating with five times fewer input frames. These results show that allowing online, language-driven refinement of 3-D memory yields more informative representations without extra training or data collection.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) planners must undergo rigorous evaluation before widespread deployment on public roads, particularly to assess their robustness against the uncertainty of human behaviors. While recent advancements in data-driven scenario generation enable the simulation of realistic human behaviors in interactive settings, leveraging these models to construct comprehensive tests for AV planners remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce an automated method to efficiently generate realistic and safety-critical human behaviors for AV planner evaluation in interactive scenarios. We parameterize complex human behaviors using low-dimensional goal positions, which are then fed into a promptable traffic simulator, ProSim, to guide the behaviors of simulated agents. To automate test generation, we introduce a prompt generation module that explores the goal domain and efficiently identifies safety-critical behaviors using Bayesian optimization. We apply our method to the evaluation of an optimization-based planner and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in automatically generating diverse and realistic driving behaviors across scenarios with varying initial conditions.

Abstract: CleanS2S is a framework for human-like speech-to-speech interaction that advances conversational AI through single-file implementation and proactive dialogue capabilities. Our system integrates automatic speech recognition, large language models, and text-to-speech synthesis into a unified pipeline with real-time interruption handling, achieving low transition latency through full-duplex websocket connections and non-blocking I/O. Beyond conventional chatbot paradigms, we pioneer a proactive interaction mechanism, which combines memory systems with Subjective Action Judgement module, enabling five human-like response strategies: interruption, refusal, deflection, silence, and standard response. The memory module dynamically aggregates historical, and contextual data to inform interaction decisions. This approach breaks the rigid turn-based convention by allowing system-initiated dialog control and context-aware response selection. And we propose Action Judgement SFT that assesses input streams for responses strategies. The framework's single-file implementation with atomic configurations offers researchers unprecedented transparency and extensibility for interaction agents. The code of CleanS2S is released at \https://github.com/opendilab/CleanS2S.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have propelled research in natural language interfaces to databases. However, most state-of-the-art text-to- SQL systems still depend on complex, multi-stage pipelines. This work proposes a novel agentic framework that unifies schema linking, query generation, and itera- tive refinement within a single, end-to-end component. By leveraging the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs, our method emulates how humans answer questions when working with unfamiliar databases: understanding the data by formulating hypotheses, running dynamic queries to validate them, reasoning over the results, and revising outputs based on observed results. Crucially, our approach intro- duces a new strategy for scaling test-time computation in text-to-SQL: we scale the depth of interactive database exploration and reflection. This shift enables the model to allocate computation dynamically to better understand the data, especially useful in ambiguous and underspecified scenarios. Our experiments show that it improved the Execution Accuracy (EX) from 44.8% to 56.5% on the challenging BIRD dataset using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B. Fur- thermore, when equipped with steps to add more diversity to the answers, our agent achieves a Best-of-N accuracy of 81.8% with 8 rounds of candidate gener- ation, rivaling the 82.79% achieved by the top-ranked published solution, while reducing engineering complexity. These findings position our unified framework as a promising alternative for building natural language interfaces to databases.

<title>Contra4: Evaluating Contrastive Cross-Modal Reasoning in Audio, Video, Image, and 3D</title>

Abstract: Real-world decision-making often begins with identifying which modality contains the most relevant information for a given query. While recent multimodal models have made impressive progress in processing diverse inputs, it remains unclear whether they can reason contrastively across multiple modalities to select the one that best satisfies a natural language prompt. We argue this capability is foundational, especially in retrieval-augmented and decision-time contexts, where systems must evaluate multiple signals and identify which one conveys the relevant information. To evaluate this skill, we introduce Contra4, a dataset for contrastive cross-modal reasoning across four modalities: image, audio, video, and 3D. Each example presents a natural language question alongside multiple candidate modality instances, and the model must select the one that semantically aligns with the prompt. Contra4 combines human-annotated captions with a mixture-of-models round-trip-consistency filter to ensure high-quality supervision, resulting in 174k training examples and a manually verified test set of 2.3k samples. While task-specific fine-tuning improves performance by 56% relative to baseline, state-of-the-art models still achieve only 56% accuracy overall and 42% in four-modality settings, underscoring a significant limitation in current multimodal models.

Abstract: Accurately determining the geographic location where a single image was taken, visual geolocation, remains a formidable challenge due to the planet's vastness and the deceptive similarity among distant locations. We introduce GeoLocSFT, a framework that demonstrates how targeted supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of a large multimodal foundation model (Gemma 3) using a small, high-quality dataset can yield highly competitive geolocation performance. GeoLocSFT is trained with only 2700 carefully selected image-GPS pairs from our geographically diverse MR600k dataset. Despite this limited data, our SFT-centric approach substantially improves over baseline models and achieves robust results on standard benchmarks such as Im2GPS-3k and YFCC-4k, as well as on our newly proposed and challenging MR40k benchmark, aimed specifically at sparsely populated regions. Further, we explore multi-candidate inference and aggregation strategies but find that the core gains are already realized at the SFT stage. Our findings highlight the power of high-quality supervision and efficient SFT for planet-scale image geolocation, especially when compared to prior methods that require massive databases or complex pipelines. To foster further research, we publicly release the MR40k benchmark dataset.

<title>On the Hardness of Approximating Distributions with Probabilistic Circuits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in probabilistic modeling is balancing expressivity and tractable inference. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) aim to directly address this tradeoff by imposing structural constraints that guarantee efficient inference of certain queries while maintaining expressivity. Since inference complexity on PCs depends on circuit size, understanding the size bounds across circuit families is key to characterizing the tradeoff between tractability and expressive efficiency. However, expressive efficiency is often studied through exact representations, where exactly encoding distributions while enforcing various structural properties often incurs exponential size blow-ups. Thus, we pose the following question: can we avoid such size blow-ups by allowing some small approximation error? We first show that approximating an arbitrary distribution with bounded $f$-divergence is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for any model that can tractably compute marginals. We then prove an exponential size gap for approximation between the class of decomposable PCs and additionally deterministic PCs.

Abstract: Representation learning of geospatial locations remains a core challenge in achieving general geospatial intelligence. Current embedding methods often lack versatility, limiting their utility across diverse tasks in both human and natural domains. We present MobCLIP, the first nationwide general-purpose location encoder, integrating an unprecedented diversity of data modalities through effective and scalable multimodal fusion. Adopting a novel CLIP-based architecture, our framework aligns 100M+ POIs, nationwide remote sensing imagery, and structured demographic statistics with a billion-edge mobility graph. By tokenizing spatial locations into grid cells inspired by Vision Transformers, we establish a unified representation space bridging mobility patterns and multimodal features. To rigorously evaluate the general-purpose effectiveness of MobCLIP, we construct a benchmark dataset composed of 11 downstream prediction tasks across social, economic, and natural domains. Experiments show that MobCLIP, with four input modalities and a compact 128-dimensional representation space, achieves significantly superior general-purpose predictive performances than state-of-the-art models by an average of 35%. Thanks to the effective integration of human-centric modalities, the performance gain is particularly profound in human-centric tasks, such as energy consumption (+260%), offline retail consumption amount (+98%), and crime cases (+95%) predictions. Echoing LLM scaling laws, we further demonstrate the scaling behavior in geospatial representation learning. We open-source code and pretrained models at: github.com.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language models have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning abilities, prompting the exploration of in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) to extend the promise to decision domains. Due to involving more complex dynamics and temporal correlations, existing ICRL approaches may face challenges in learning from suboptimal trajectories and achieving precise in-context inference. In the paper, we propose \textbf{S}calable \textbf{I}n-\textbf{C}ontext \textbf{Q}-\textbf{L}earning (\textbf{SICQL}), an innovative framework that harnesses dynamic programming and world modeling to steer ICRL toward efficient reward maximization and task generalization, while retaining the scalability and stability of supervised pretraining. We design a prompt-based multi-head transformer architecture that simultaneously predicts optimal policies and in-context value functions using separate heads. We pretrain a generalized world model to capture task-relevant information, enabling the construction of a compact prompt that facilitates fast and precise in-context inference. During training, we perform iterative policy improvement by fitting a state value function to an upper-expectile of the Q-function, and distill the in-context value functions into policy extraction using advantage-weighted regression. Extensive experiments across a range of discrete and continuous environments show consistent performance gains over various types of baselines, especially when learning from suboptimal data.

<title>Overcoming Multi-step Complexity in Multimodal Theory-of-Mind Reasoning: A Scalable Bayesian Planner</title>

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) enables humans to infer mental states-such as beliefs, desires, and intentions-forming the foundation of social cognition. However, existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex environments.

Abstract: Operations research (OR) is widely deployed to solve critical decision-making problems with complex objectives and constraints, impacting manufacturing, logistics, finance, and healthcare outcomes. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in various domains, their practical application in industry-relevant operations research (OR) problems presents significant challenges and opportunities. Preliminary industrial applications of LLMs for operations research face two critical deployment challenges: 1) Self-correction focuses on code syntax rather than mathematical accuracy, causing costly errors; 2) Complex expert selection creates unpredictable workflows that reduce transparency and increase maintenance costs, making them impractical for time-sensitive business applications. To address these business limitations, we introduce ORMind, a cognitive-inspired framework that enhances optimization through counterfactual reasoning. Our approach emulates human cognition, implementing an end-to-end workflow that systematically transforms requirements into mathematical models and executable solver code. It is currently being tested internally in Lenovo's AI Assistant, with plans to enhance optimization capabilities for both business and consumer customers. Experiments demonstrate that ORMind outperforms existing methods, achieving a 9.5\% improvement on the NL4Opt dataset and a 14.6\% improvement on the ComplexOR dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online environments.

Abstract: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.

Abstract: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this \textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for the participants in the community to bridge the implementation gap.

Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs), especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover, most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices. AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and $91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

Abstract: Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems serve as the digital backbone of modern financial institutions, yet they continue to rely on static, rule-based workflows that limit adaptability, scalability, and intelligence. As business operations grow more complex and data-rich, conventional ERP platforms struggle to integrate structured and unstructured data in real time and to accommodate dynamic, cross-functional workflows.
  In this paper, we present the first AI-native, agent-based framework for ERP systems, introducing a novel architecture of Generative Business Process AI Agents (GBPAs) that bring autonomy, reasoning, and dynamic optimization to enterprise workflows. The proposed system integrates generative AI with business process modeling and multi-agent orchestration, enabling end-to-end automation of complex tasks such as budget planning, financial reporting, and wire transfer processing. Unlike traditional workflow engines, GBPAs interpret user intent, synthesize workflows in real time, and coordinate specialized sub-agents for modular task execution. We validate the framework through case studies in bank wire transfers and employee reimbursements, two representative financial workflows with distinct complexity and data modalities. Results show that GBPAs achieve up to 40% reduction in processing time, 94% drop in error rate, and improved regulatory compliance by enabling parallelism, risk control insertion, and semantic reasoning. These findings highlight the potential of GBPAs to bridge the gap between generative AI capabilities and enterprise-grade automation, laying the groundwork for the next generation of intelligent ERP systems.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models has catalyzed two distinct yet interconnected paradigms in artificial intelligence: standalone AI Agents and collaborative Agentic AI ecosystems. This comprehensive study establishes a definitive framework for distinguishing these architectures through systematic analysis of their operational principles, structural compositions, and deployment methodologies. We characterize AI Agents as specialized, tool-enhanced systems leveraging foundation models for targeted automation within constrained environments. Conversely, Agentic AI represents sophisticated multi-entity frameworks where distributed agents exhibit emergent collective intelligence through coordinated interaction protocols. Our investigation traces the evolutionary trajectory from traditional rule-based systems through generative AI foundations to contemporary agent architectures. We present detailed architectural comparisons examining planning mechanisms, memory systems, coordination protocols, and decision-making processes. The study categorizes application landscapes, contrasting single-agent implementations in customer service and content management with multi-agent deployments in research automation and complex decision support. We identify critical challenges including reliability issues, coordination complexities, and scalability constraints, while proposing innovative solutions through enhanced reasoning frameworks, robust memory architectures, and improved coordination mechanisms. This framework provides essential guidance for practitioners selecting appropriate agentic approaches and establishes foundational principles for next-generation intelligent system development.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has driven breakthroughs in AI, from game-play to scientific discovery and AI alignment. However, its broader applicability remains limited by challenges such as low data efficiency and poor generalizability. Recent advances suggest that large language models, with their rich world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, could complement RL by enabling semantic state modeling and task-agnostic planning. In this work, we propose the Agentic Episodic Control (AEC), a novel architecture that integrates RL with LLMs to enhance decision-making. The AEC can leverage a large language model (LLM) to map the observations into language-grounded embeddings, which further can be stored in an episodic memory for rapid retrieval of high-value experiences. Simultaneously, a World-Graph working memory module is utilized to capture structured environmental dynamics in order to enhance relational reasoning. Furthermore, a lightweight critical state detector dynamically arbitrates between the episodic memory recall and the world-model-guided exploration. On the whole, by combining the trial-and-error learning scheme with LLM-derived semantic priors, the proposed AEC can improve both data efficiency and generalizability in reinforcement learning. In experiments on BabyAI-Text benchmark tasks, AEC demonstrates substantial improvements over existing baselines, especially on complex and generalization tasks like FindObj, where it outperforms the best baseline by up to 76%. The proposed AEC framework bridges the strengths of numeric reinforcement learning and symbolic reasoning, which provides a pathway toward more adaptable and sample-efficient agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans (P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning. With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

Abstract: The emergence of multimodal LLM-based agents (MLAs) has transformed interaction paradigms by seamlessly integrating vision, language, action and dynamic environments, enabling unprecedented autonomous capabilities across GUI applications ranging from web automation to mobile systems. However, MLAs introduce critical trustworthiness challenges that extend far beyond traditional language models' limitations, as they can directly modify digital states and trigger irreversible real-world consequences. Existing benchmarks inadequately tackle these unique challenges posed by MLAs' actionable outputs, long-horizon uncertainty and multimodal attack vectors. In this paper, we introduce MLA-Trust, the first comprehensive and unified framework that evaluates the MLA trustworthiness across four principled dimensions: truthfulness, controllability, safety and privacy. We utilize websites and mobile applications as realistic testbeds, designing 34 high-risk interactive tasks and curating rich evaluation datasets. Large-scale experiments involving 13 state-of-the-art agents reveal previously unexplored trustworthiness vulnerabilities unique to multimodal interactive scenarios. For instance, proprietary and open-source GUI-interacting MLAs pose more severe trustworthiness risks than static MLLMs, particularly in high-stakes domains; the transition from static MLLMs into interactive MLAs considerably compromises trustworthiness, enabling harmful content generation in multi-step interactions that standalone MLLMs would typically prevent; multi-step execution, while enhancing the adaptability of MLAs, involves latent nonlinear risk accumulation across successive interactions, circumventing existing safeguards and resulting in unpredictable derived risks. Moreover, we present an extensible toolbox to facilitate continuous evaluation of MLA trustworthiness across diverse interactive environments.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

Abstract: Humans excel at analogical reasoning - applying knowledge from one task to a related one with minimal relearning. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) agents typically require extensive retraining even when new tasks share structural similarities with previously learned ones. In this work, we propose MAGIK, a novel framework that enables RL agents to transfer knowledge to analogous tasks without interacting with the target environment. Our approach leverages an imagination mechanism to map entities in the target task to their analogues in the source domain, allowing the agent to reuse its original policy. Experiments on custom MiniGrid and MuJoCo tasks show that MAGIK achieves effective zero-shot transfer using only a small number of human-labelled examples. We compare our approach to related baselines and highlight how it offers a novel and effective mechanism for knowledge transfer via imagination-based analogy mapping.

Abstract: The development of AI agents based on large, open-domain language models (LLMs) has paved the way for the development of general-purpose AI assistants that can support human in tasks such as writing, coding, graphic design, and scientific research. A major challenge with such agents is that, by necessity, they are trained by observing relatively short-term interactions with humans. Such models can fail to generalize to long-term interactions, for example, interactions where a user has repeatedly corrected mistakes on the part of the agent. In this work, we argue that these challenges can be overcome by explicitly modeling humans' social intelligence, that is, their ability to build and maintain long-term relationships with other agents whose behavior cannot always be predicted. By mathematically modeling the strategies humans use to communicate and reason about one another over long periods of time, we may be able to derive new game theoretic objectives against which LLMs and future AI agents may be optimized.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities in various visual tasks. However, their abilities in K12 scenarios are still systematically underexplored. Previous studies suffer from various limitations including narrow subject coverage, insufficient data scale, lack of diversity in question types, and naive answer-centric evaluation method, resulting in insufficient exploration of model capabilities. To address these gaps, we propose K12Vista, the most comprehensive multimodal benchmark for Chinese K12 subject knowledge understanding and reasoning to date, featuring 33,000 questions across five core subjects from primary to high school and three question types. Moreover, beyond the final outcome, we are also concerned with the correctness of MLLMs' reasoning processes. For this purpose, we meticulously compiles errors from MLLMs' reasoning processes and leverage an automated data pipeline to construct K12-PEM-800K, the largest process evaluation dataset offering detailed step-by-step judgement annotations for MLLMs' reasoning. Subsequently, we developed K12-PEM, an advanced process evaluation model that integrates an overall assessment of both the reasoning process and answer correctness. Moreover, we also introduce K12-PEBench, the first high-quality, human-annotated benchmark specifically designed for evaluating abilities of reasoning process evaluation.Extensive experiments reveal that current MLLMs exhibit significant flaws when reasoning within K12Vista, providing critical insights for the development of more capable MLLMs.We open our resources at https://github.com/lichongod/K12Vista.

Abstract: Societies worldwide are rapidly entering a super-aged era, making elderly health a pressing concern. The aging population is increasing the burden on national economies and households. Dementia cases are rising significantly with this demographic shift. Recent research using voice-based models and large language models (LLM) offers new possibilities for dementia diagnosis and treatment. Our Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning method combines speech and language models. The process starts with automatic speech recognition to convert speech to text. We add a linear layer to an LLM for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD classification, using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with CoT reasoning and cues. This approach showed an 16.7% relative performance improvement compared to methods without CoT prompt reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance in CoT approaches.

Abstract: Querying generative AI models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), has become a prevalent method for information acquisition. However, existing query-answer datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark, RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V) models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds 4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries, pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.

<title>A Descriptive and Normative Theory of Human Beliefs in RLHF</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01692</link>

Abstract: Human preferences in RLHF are typically modeled as a function of the human's reward function or corresponding optimal state-action values. In this work, we propose that human beliefs about the capabilities of the agent being trained also play a key role in preference generation. We examine two questions related to this hypothesis, one descriptive and one normative, respectively: Do human labelers' beliefs about agent capabilities affect the preferences that they provide? And what is the ideal set of beliefs about an agent -- and resulting preferences -- for humans to have? We propose a new preference model that incorporates human beliefs and provide a normative theory that bounds the error on the final learned policy based on the \textit{mismatch} between the human's beliefs and an idealized set of beliefs. We then confirm via a human study that beliefs about agent capabilities do, in fact, significantly affect preferences and can be influenced through simple interventions. Additionally, we empirically show through synthetic experiments that it is often suboptimal for human preference labelers to assume agent optimality. Collectively, these results theoretically and empirically demonstrate how reducing the mismatch between human beliefs and agent capabilities can lead to more performant RLHF and point toward new best practices for RLHF practitioners.

Abstract: To address the challenge of information overload from massive web contents, recommender systems are widely applied to retrieve and present personalized results for users. However, recommendation tasks are inherently constrained to filtering existing items and lack the ability to generate novel concepts, limiting their capacity to fully satisfy user demands and preferences. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that goes beyond content filtering and selecting: directly generating personalized items in a multimodal form, such as images, tailored to individual users. To accomplish this, we leverage any-to-any Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and train them in both supervised fine-tuning and online reinforcement learning strategy to equip them with the ability to yield tailored next items for users. Experiments on two benchmark datasets and user study confirm the efficacy of the proposed method. Notably, the generated images not only align well with users' historical preferences but also exhibit relevance to their potential future interests.

Abstract: Large language models are quickly becoming the foundation for intelligent agents that are capable of using tools. However, training such agents is challenging because it requires human creation and annotation of a diverse set of tasks, tools, and evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose the Self-Challenging framework for training an agent on high-quality tasks that are generated by itself. The agent first plays the role of challenger and generates a task after interacting with the given tools. The tasks take the form of a novel general class of problems termed Code-as-Task, which are defined by an instruction, a verification function and solution and failure cases which serve as tests, allowing to filter only for high-quality tasks. The agent then takes an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, despite using only self-generated training data.

Abstract: This paper provides an in-depth technical analysis and implementation methodology of the open-source Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol developed by Google and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced by Anthropic. While the evolution of LLM-based autonomous agents is rapidly accelerating, efficient interactions among these agents and their integration with external systems remain significant challenges. In modern AI systems, collaboration between autonomous agents and integration with external tools have become essential elements for building practical AI applications. A2A offers a standardized communication method that enables agents developed in heterogeneous environments to collaborate effectively, while MCP provides a structured I/O framework for agents to connect with external tools and resources. Prior studies have focused primarily on the features and applications of either A2A or MCP individually. In contrast, this study takes an integrated approach, exploring how the two protocols can complement each other to address interoperability issues and facilitate efficient collaboration within complex agent ecosystems.

<title>The Ultimate Test of Superintelligent AI Agents: Can an AI Balance Care and Control in Asymmetric Relationships?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01813</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: This paper introduces the Shepherd Test, a new conceptual test for assessing the moral and relational dimensions of superintelligent artificial agents. The test is inspired by human interactions with animals, where ethical considerations about care, manipulation, and consumption arise in contexts of asymmetric power and self-preservation. We argue that AI crosses an important, and potentially dangerous, threshold of intelligence when it exhibits the ability to manipulate, nurture, and instrumentally use less intelligent agents, while also managing its own survival and expansion goals. This includes the ability to weigh moral trade-offs between self-interest and the well-being of subordinate agents. The Shepherd Test thus challenges traditional AI evaluation paradigms by emphasizing moral agency, hierarchical behavior, and complex decision-making under existential stakes. We argue that this shift is critical for advancing AI governance, particularly as AI systems become increasingly integrated into multi-agent environments. We conclude by identifying key research directions, including the development of simulation environments for testing moral behavior in AI, and the formalization of ethical manipulation within multi-agent systems.

<title>Fodor and Pylyshyn's Legacy - Still No Human-like Systematic Compositionality in Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Strong meta-learning capabilities for systematic compositionality are emerging as an important skill for navigating the complex and changing tasks of today's world. However, in presenting models for robust adaptation to novel environments, it is important to refrain from making unsupported claims about the performance of meta-learning systems that ultimately do not stand up to scrutiny. While Fodor and Pylyshyn famously posited that neural networks inherently lack this capacity as they are unable to model compositional representations or structure-sensitive operations, and thus are not a viable model of the human mind, Lake and Baroni recently presented meta-learning as a pathway to compositionality. In this position paper, we critically revisit this claim and highlight limitations in the proposed meta-learning framework for compositionality. Our analysis shows that modern neural meta-learning systems can only perform such tasks, if at all, under a very narrow and restricted definition of a meta-learning setup. We therefore claim that `Fodor and Pylyshyn's legacy' persists, and to date, there is no human-like systematic compositionality learned in neural networks.

<title>WHEN TO ACT, WHEN TO WAIT: Modeling Structural Trajectories for Intent Triggerability in Task-Oriented Dialogue</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions. Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

Abstract: The meteoric rise and proliferation of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents promise significant capabilities across various domains. However, their deployment is increasingly constrained by substantial computational demands, specifically for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) resources. This paper addresses the critical problem of optimizing resource utilization in LLM agent systems. We introduce COALESCE (Cost-Optimized and Secure Agent Labour Exchange via Skill-based Competence Estimation), a novel framework designed to enable autonomous LLM agents to dynamically outsource specific subtasks to specialized, cost-effective third-party LLM agents. The framework integrates mechanisms for hybrid skill representation, dynamic skill discovery, automated task decomposition, a unified cost model comparing internal execution costs against external outsourcing prices, simplified market-based decision-making algorithms, and a standardized communication protocol between LLM agents. Comprehensive validation through 239 theoretical simulations demonstrates 41.8\% cost reduction potential, while large-scale empirical validation across 240 real LLM tasks confirms 20.3\% cost reduction with proper epsilon-greedy exploration, establishing both theoretical viability and practical effectiveness. The emergence of proposed open standards like Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol further underscores the need for frameworks like COALESCE that can leverage such standards for efficient agent interaction. By facilitating a dynamic market for agent capabilities, potentially utilizing protocols like A2A for communication, COALESCE aims to significantly reduce operational costs, enhance system scalability, and foster the emergence of specialized agent economies, making complex LLM agent functionalities more accessible and economically viable.

<title>Understanding Overadaptation in Supervised Fine-Tuning: The Role of Ensemble Methods</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01901</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.01901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on domain-specific data is the dominant approach for adapting foundation models to specialized tasks. However, it has been observed that SFT models tend to forget knowledge acquired during pretraining. In vision models, ensembling a pretrained model with its fine-tuned counterpart has been shown to mitigate this issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the same holds for language models, and, more strikingly, we observe an overadaptation phenomenon: the ensemble model not only retains general knowledge from the foundation model but also outperforms the fine-tuned model even on the fine-tuning domain itself. Despite the empirical success of ensembling, a theoretical understanding of its benefits remains underexplored. We develop a formal theoretical analysis of the overadaptation phenomenon. Ensembling mitigates this by balancing two primary sources of error: bias, caused by insufficient fine-tuning, and variance, introduced by overfitting to fine-tuning data. While regularization techniques aim to address this trade-off, we show that ensembling provides a more effective solution. We analyze this phenomenon in over-parameterized linear settings and demonstrate that interpolating between pretrained and fine-tuned weights significantly improves performance. These findings offer theoretical justification for the observed advantages of model ensembling, supported by empirical experiments consistent with our analysis.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes, marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. By proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

Abstract: Humans naturally process real-world multimodal information in a full-duplex manner. In artificial intelligence, replicating this capability is essential for advancing model development and deployment, particularly in embodied contexts. The development of multimodal models faces two primary challenges: (1) effectively handling more than three modalities-such as vision, audio, and text; and (2) delivering full-duplex responses to rapidly evolving human instructions. To facilitate research on models that support both omnimodal processing and full duplexity, we present RoboEgo (alias: FLM-Ego), a unified model system designed to address both challenges. RoboEgo incorporates a backbone architecture and algorithms that natively support full duplexity, achieving a theoretical duplex latency of 80 ms. In streaming visually grounded conversations under real-world conditions, RoboEgo exhibits superior responsiveness and speech naturalness, while maintaining comparable content qualities to state-of-the-art semi-duplex omnimodal models-a feat previously considered unattainable by native full-duplex systems.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a significant increase in the adoption of AI techniques to enhance electronic design automation. In particular, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant interest in LLM-assisted hardware design generation, spanning applications from classical digital circuits to quantum computing. Despite substantial progress in this direction, the quality of LLM-generated hardware design still cannot meet the requirements for practical deployment. In this work, we identify three critical challenges hindering the development of LLM-assisted hardware design generation: 1) limited data availability, 2) varied data quality, 3) inadequate inference-time efficiency. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces a two-stage framework for AI-assisted hardware design by exploring decentralized training and personalized inference. In the first stage, we propose to harness private domain design sources through a hierarchical decentralized training mechanism that addresses data-sharing constraints. To mitigate the impact of low-quality data, we identify optimization opportunities in hardware generation tasks, using user-defined metrics for model aggregation. The second stage focuses on client personalization to enhance both speed and quality. We introduce a new metric, Trueput, to analyze LLM-assisted hardware generation efficiency. To optimize Trueput, we implement personalized inference-time acceleration and customized sampling strategies. Evaluating both classical and quantum benchmarks, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage framework can significantly improve the model capability for hardware design generation. As orthogonal enhancements to existing methods, our framework can achieve $33\% \sim 50\%$ semantic accuracy improvement and $2.3$ times speedup, depending on the difficulty of the generation tasks.

Abstract: Analog In-Memory Compute (AIMC) can improve the energy efficiency of Deep Learning by orders of magnitude. Yet analog-domain device and circuit non-idealities -- within the analog ``Tiles'' performing Matrix-Vector Multiply (MVM) operations -- can degrade neural-network task accuracy. We quantify the impact of low-level distortions and noise, and develop a mathematical model for Multiply-ACcumulate (MAC) operations mapped to analog tiles. Instantaneous-current IR-drop (the most significant circuit non-ideality), and ADC quantization effects are fully captured by this model, which can predict MVM tile-outputs both rapidly and accurately, as compared to much slower rigorous circuit simulations. A statistical model of PCM read noise at nanosecond timescales is derived from -- and matched against -- experimental measurements. We integrate these (statistical) device and (deterministic) circuit effects into a PyTorch-based framework to assess the accuracy impact on the BERT and ALBERT Transformer networks. We show that hardware-aware fine-tuning using simple Gaussian noise provides resilience against ADC quantization and PCM read noise effects, but is less effective against IR-drop. This is because IR-drop -- although deterministic -- is non-linear, is changing significantly during the time-integration window, and is ultimately dependent on all the excitations being introduced in parallel into the analog tile. The apparent inability of simple Gaussian noise applied during training to properly prepare a DNN network for IR-drop during inference implies that more complex training approaches -- incorporating advances such as the Tile-circuit model introduced here -- will be critical for resilient deployment of large neural networks onto AIMC hardware.

Abstract: Small molecules are essential to drug discovery, and graph-language models hold promise for learning molecular properties and functions from text. However, existing molecule-text datasets are limited in scale and informativeness, restricting the training of generalizable multimodal models. We present MolTextNet, a dataset of 2.5 million high-quality molecule-text pairs designed to overcome these limitations. To construct it, we propose a synthetic text generation pipeline that integrates structural features, computed properties, bioactivity data, and synthetic complexity. Using GPT-4o-mini, we create structured descriptions for 2.5 million molecules from ChEMBL35, with text over 10 times longer than prior datasets. MolTextNet supports diverse downstream tasks, including property prediction and structure retrieval. Pretraining CLIP-style models with Graph Neural Networks and ModernBERT on MolTextNet yields improved performance, highlighting its potential for advancing foundational multimodal modeling in molecular science. Our dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuganghuggingface/moltextnet.

Abstract: This report introduces the experience of developing Amadeus Verbo, a family of large language models for Brazilian Portuguese. To handle diverse use cases, Amadeus Verbo includes base-tuned, merged, and instruction-tuned models in sizes of 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 14B, 32B, and 72B parameters. Thus, the main objective is to show how easy it is to fine-tune foundation models to democratize the open-source development of Brazilian Portuguese LLMs when data and resources are available.

Abstract: In the near future a governmental body will be asked to allow companies to use AI for age verification. If they allow it the resulting system will both be easily circumvented and disproportionately misclassify minorities and low socioeconomic status users. This is predictable by showing that other very similar systems (facial recognition and remote proctoring software) have similar issues despite years of efforts to mitigate their biases. These biases are due to technical limitations both of the AI models themselves and the physical hardware they are running on that will be difficult to overcome below the cost of government ID-based age verification. Thus in, the near future, deploying an AI system for age verification is folly.

Abstract: Humanity is progressing towards automated product development, a trend that promises faster creation of better products and thus the acceleration of technological progress. However, increasing reliance on non-human agents for this process introduces many risks. This perspective aims to initiate a discussion on these risks and appropriate mitigation strategies. To this end, we outline a set of principles for safer AI-driven product development which emphasize human oversight, accountability, and explainable design, among others. The risk assessment covers both technical risks which affect product quality and safety, and sociotechnical risks which affect society. While AI-driven product development is still in its early stages, this discussion will help balance its opportunities and risks without delaying essential progress in understanding, norm-setting, and regulation.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison of embedding models in tri-modal hybrid retrieval for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. We investigate the fusion of dense semantic, sparse lexical, and graph-based embeddings, focusing on the performance of the MiniLM-v6 and BGE-Large architectures. Contrary to conventional assumptions, our results show that the compact MiniLM-v6 outperforms the larger BGE-Large when integrated with LLM-based re-ranking within our tri-modal hybrid framework. Experiments conducted on the SciFact, FIQA, and NFCorpus datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval quality with the MiniLM-v6 configuration. The performance difference is particularly pronounced in agentic re-ranking scenarios, indicating better alignment between MiniLM-v6's embedding space and LLM reasoning. Our findings suggest that embedding model selection for RAG systems should prioritize compatibility with multi-signal fusion and LLM alignment, rather than relying solely on larger models. This approach may reduce computational requirements while improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations that disrupt normal gene expression, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and metastasis. High-dimensional microarray datasets pose challenges for classification models due to the "small n, large p" problem, resulting in overfitting. This study makes three different key contributions: 1) we propose a machine learning-based approach integrating the Feature Selection Without Re-placement (FSWOR) technique and a projection method to improve classification accuracy. 2) We apply the Kendall statistical test to identify the most significant genes from the brain cancer mi-croarray dataset (GSE50161), reducing the feature space from 54,675 to 20,890 genes.3) we apply machine learning models using k-fold cross validation techniques in which our model incorpo-rates ensemble classifiers with LDA projection and Na\"ive Bayes, achieving a test score of 96%, outperforming existing methods by 9.09%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proach in high-dimensional gene expression analysis, improving classification accuracy while mitigating overfitting. This study contributes to cancer biomarker discovery, offering a robust computational method for analyzing microarray data.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has created a new job role: the Prompt Engineer. Despite growing interest in this position, we still do not fully understand what skills this new job role requires or how common these jobs are. We analyzed 20,662 job postings on LinkedIn, including 72 prompt engineer positions, to learn more about this emerging role. We found that prompt engineering is still rare (less than 0.5% of sampled job postings) but has a unique skill profile. Prompt engineers need AI knowledge (22.8%), prompt design skills (18.7%), good communication (21.9%), and creative problem-solving (15.8%) skills. These requirements significantly differ from those of established roles, such as data scientists and machine learning engineers, showing that prompt engineering is becoming its own profession. Our findings help job seekers, employers, and educational institutions in better understanding the emerging field of prompt engineering.

Abstract: Purpose: We investigated the utilization of privacy-preserving, locally-deployed, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR reports. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing open-source, privacy-preserving LLMs in clinical settings for automated analysis of imaging reports, enabling accurate, fast and resource-efficient diagnostic categorization.

Abstract: In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in natural dialogues.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner, with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios, explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper, our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset. Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs' proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task, they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a clear challenge in current NLP systems.

Abstract: Multi-agent large language models (MA-LLMs) are a rapidly growing research area that leverages multiple interacting language agents to tackle complex tasks, outperforming single-agent large language models. This literature review synthesizes the latest research on agent profiles, communication structures, and decision-making processes, drawing insights from both traditional multi-agent systems and state-of-the-art MA-LLM studies. In doing so, it aims to address the lack of direct comparisons in the field, illustrating how factors like scalability, communication structure, and decision-making processes influence MA-LLM performance. By examining frequent practices and outlining current challenges, the review reveals that multi-agent approaches can yield superior results but also face elevated computational costs and under-explored challenges unique to MA-LLM. Overall, these findings provide researchers and practitioners with a roadmap for developing robust and efficient multi-agent AI solutions.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test (PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social (libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing frameworks.

<title>Evaluating the Sensitivity of LLMs to Prior Context</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks, focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude, and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable. Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown great promise in advancing robotics by combining embodied reasoning with robot control. A common approach involves training on embodied reasoning tasks related to robot control using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, SFT datasets are often heuristically constructed and not explicitly optimized for improving robot control. Furthermore, SFT often leads to issues such as catastrophic forgetting and reduced generalization performance. To address these limitations, we introduce Robot-R1, a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enhance embodied reasoning specifically for robot control. Robot-R1 learns to predict the next keypoint state required for task completion, conditioned on the current scene image and environment metadata derived from expert demonstrations. Inspired by the DeepSeek-R1 learning approach, Robot-R1 samples reasoning-based responses and reinforces those that lead to more accurate predictions. Our experiments show that models trained with Robot-R1 outperform SFT methods on embodied reasoning tasks. Despite having only 7B parameters, Robot-R1 even surpasses GPT-4o on reasoning tasks related to low-level action control, such as spatial and primitive movement reasoning.

Abstract: Coordinated human movement depends on the integration of multisensory inputs, sensorimotor transformation, and motor execution, as well as sensory feedback resulting from body-environment interaction. Building dynamic models of the sensory-musculoskeletal system is essential for understanding movement control and investigating human behaviours. Here, we report a human sensory-musculoskeletal model, termed SMS-Human, that integrates precise anatomical representations of bones, joints, and muscle-tendon units with multimodal sensory inputs involving visual, vestibular, proprioceptive, and tactile components. A stage-wise hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework was developed to address the inherent challenges of high-dimensional control in musculoskeletal systems with integrated multisensory information. Using this framework, we demonstrated the simulation of three representative movement tasks, including bipedal locomotion, vision-guided object manipulation, and human-machine interaction during bicycling. Our results showed a close resemblance between natural and simulated human motor behaviours. The simulation also revealed musculoskeletal dynamics that could not be directly measured. This work sheds deeper insights into the sensorimotor dynamics of human movements, facilitates quantitative understanding of human behaviours in interactive contexts, and informs the design of systems with embodied intelligence.

Abstract: This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini, Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles (Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales (1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance. Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence, highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in high-stakes medical tasks.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the performance of six open-weight LLMs (llama3-8b, llama3.1-8b, gemma2-9b, mixtral-8x7b, llama3-70b, llama3.1-70b) in recommending experts in physics across five tasks: top-k experts by field, influential scientists by discipline, epoch, seniority, and scholar counterparts. The evaluation examines consistency, factuality, and biases related to gender, ethnicity, academic popularity, and scholar similarity. Using ground-truth data from the American Physical Society and OpenAlex, we establish scholarly benchmarks by comparing model outputs to real-world academic records. Our analysis reveals inconsistencies and biases across all models. mixtral-8x7b produces the most stable outputs, while llama3.1-70b shows the highest variability. Many models exhibit duplication, and some, particularly gemma2-9b and llama3.1-8b, struggle with formatting errors. LLMs generally recommend real scientists, but accuracy drops in field-, epoch-, and seniority-specific queries, consistently favoring senior scholars. Representation biases persist, replicating gender imbalances (reflecting male predominance), under-representing Asian scientists, and over-representing White scholars. Despite some diversity in institutional and collaboration networks, models favor highly cited and productive scholars, reinforcing the rich-getricher effect while offering limited geographical representation. These findings highlight the need to improve LLMs for more reliable and equitable scholarly recommendations.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, in industrial robotics enhances operational efficiency and human-robot collaboration. However, the computational complexity and size of these models often provide latency problems in request and response times. This study explores the integration of the ChatGPT natural language model with the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) to mitigate interaction latency and improve robotic system control within a simulated Gazebo environment. We present an architecture that integrates these technologies without requiring a middleware transport platform, detailing how a simulated mobile robot responds to text and voice commands. Experimental results demonstrate that this integration improves execution speed, usability, and accessibility of the human-robot interaction by decreasing the communication latency by 7.01\% on average. Such improvements facilitate smoother, real-time robot operations, which are crucial for industrial automation and precision tasks.

Abstract: Television networks face high financial risk when making programming decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost, and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers, executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior.

Abstract: The rapid integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes decision-making -- such as allocating scarce resources like donor organs -- raises critical questions about their alignment with human moral values. We systematically evaluate the behavior of several prominent LLMs against human preferences in kidney allocation scenarios and show that LLMs: i) exhibit stark deviations from human values in prioritizing various attributes, and ii) in contrast to humans, LLMs rarely express indecision, opting for deterministic decisions even when alternative indecision mechanisms (e.g., coin flipping) are provided. Nonetheless, we show that low-rank supervised fine-tuning with few samples is often effective in improving both decision consistency and calibrating indecision modeling. These findings illustrate the necessity of explicit alignment strategies for LLMs in moral/ethical domains.

Abstract: With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2.com, we apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains. These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning, coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain, including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded, user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and digital policy.

Abstract: Many people suffer from mental health problems but not everyone seeks professional help or has access to mental health care. AI chatbots have increasingly become a go-to for individuals who either have mental disorders or simply want someone to talk to. This paper presents a study on participants who have previously used chatbots and a scenario-based testing of large language model (LLM) chatbots. Our findings indicate that AI chatbots were primarily utilized as a "Five minute therapist" or as a non-judgmental companion. Participants appreciated the anonymity and lack of judgment from chatbots. However, there were concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive information. The scenario-based testing of LLM chatbots highlighted additional issues. Some chatbots were consistently reassuring, used emojis and names to add a personal touch, and were quick to suggest seeking professional help. However, there were limitations such as inconsistent tone, occasional inappropriate responses (e.g., casual or romantic), and a lack of crisis sensitivity, particularly in recognizing red flag language and escalating responses appropriately. These findings can inform both the technology and mental health care industries on how to better utilize AI chatbots to support individuals during challenging emotional periods.

<title>Hi-Dyna Graph: Hierarchical Dynamic Scene Graph for Robotic Autonomy in Human-Centric Environments</title>

Abstract: Autonomous operation of service robotics in human-centric scenes remains challenging due to the need for understanding of changing environments and context-aware decision-making. While existing approaches like topological maps offer efficient spatial priors, they fail to model transient object relationships, whereas dense neural representations (e.g., NeRF) incur prohibitive computational costs. Inspired by the hierarchical scene representation and video scene graph generation works, we propose Hi-Dyna Graph, a hierarchical dynamic scene graph architecture that integrates persistent global layouts with localized dynamic semantics for embodied robotic autonomy. Our framework constructs a global topological graph from posed RGB-D inputs, encoding room-scale connectivity and large static objects (e.g., furniture), while environmental and egocentric cameras populate dynamic subgraphs with object position relations and human-object interaction patterns. A hybrid architecture is conducted by anchoring these subgraphs to the global topology using semantic and spatial constraints, enabling seamless updates as the environment evolves. An agent powered by large language models (LLMs) is employed to interpret the unified graph, infer latent task triggers, and generate executable instructions grounded in robotic affordances. We conduct complex experiments to demonstrate Hi-Dyna Grap's superior scene representation effectiveness. Real-world deployments validate the system's practicality with a mobile manipulator: robotics autonomously complete complex tasks with no further training or complex rewarding in a dynamic scene as cafeteria assistant.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce \textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals, demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

<title>SwitchLingua: The First Large-Scale Multilingual and Multi-Ethnic Code-Switching Dataset</title>

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech (CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.
  Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate \textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12 languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity, offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the \textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware assessment of system performance.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations (HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space. Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The reasoning, writing, text-editing, and retrieval capabilities of proprietary large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly, providing users with an ever-expanding set of functionalities. However, this growing utility has also led to a serious societal concern: the over-reliance on LLMs. In particular, users increasingly delegate tasks such as homework, assignments, or the processing of sensitive documents to LLMs without meaningful engagement. This form of over-reliance and misuse is emerging as a significant social issue. In order to mitigate these issues, we propose a method injecting imperceptible phantom tokens into documents, which causes LLMs to generate outputs that appear plausible to users but are in fact incorrect. Based on this technique, we introduce TRAPDOC, a framework designed to deceive over-reliant LLM users. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on proprietary LLMs, comparing its impact against several baselines. TRAPDOC serves as a strong foundation for promoting more responsible and thoughtful engagement with language models. Our code is available at https://github.com/jindong22/TrapDoc.

Abstract: This paper explores the emotional, ethical and practical dimensions of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into personal and professional workflows, focusing on the concept of feeling guilty as a 'c(ai)borg' - a human augmented by AI. Inspired by Donna Haraway's Cyborg Manifesto, the study explores how AI challenges traditional notions of creativity, originality and intellectual labour. Using an autoethnographic approach, the authors reflect on their year-long experiences with AI tools, revealing a transition from initial guilt and reluctance to empowerment through skill-building and transparency. Key findings highlight the importance of basic academic skills, advanced AI literacy and honest engagement with AI results. The c(ai)borg vision advocates for a future where AI is openly embraced as a collaborative partner, fostering innovation and equity while addressing issues of access and agency. By reframing guilt as growth, the paper calls for a thoughtful and inclusive approach to AI integration.

Abstract: Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex, inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene mutations, mutation subtypes and their exons in lung cancer is critical for personalized treatment planning and prognostic assessment. Faced with regional disparities in medical resources and the high cost of genomic assays, using artificial intelligence to infer these mutations and exon variants from routine histopathology images could greatly facilitate precision therapy. Although some prior studies have shown that deep learning can accelerate the prediction of key gene mutations from lung cancer pathology slides, their performance remains suboptimal and has so far been limited mainly to early screening tasks. To address these limitations, we have assembled PathGene, which comprises histopathology images paired with next-generation sequencing reports from 1,576 patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, and 448 TCGA-LUAD patients. This multi-center dataset links whole-slide images to driver gene mutation status, mutation subtypes, exon, and tumor mutational burden (TMB) status, with the goal of leveraging pathology images to predict mutations, subtypes, exon locations, and TMB for early genetic screening and to advance precision oncology. Unlike existing datasets, we provide molecular-level information related to histopathology images in PathGene to facilitate the development of biomarker prediction models. We benchmarked 11 multiple-instance learning methods on PathGene for mutation, subtype, exon, and TMB prediction tasks. These experimental methods provide valuable alternatives for early genetic screening of lung cancer patients and assisting clinicians to quickly develop personalized precision targeted treatment plans for patients.

Abstract: Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies, as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this, anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults. This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy, but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.

<title>Gated Multimodal Graph Learning for Personalized Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate the cold-start and sparsity problems in collaborative filtering by incorporating rich content information, such as product images and textual descriptions. However, effectively integrating heterogeneous modalities into a unified recommendation framework remains a challenge. Existing approaches often rely on fixed fusion strategies or complex architectures , which may fail to adapt to modality quality variance or introduce unnecessary computational overhead.
  In this work, we propose RLMultimodalRec, a lightweight and modular recommendation framework that combines graph-based user modeling with adaptive multimodal item encoding. The model employs a gated fusion module to dynamically balance the contribution of visual and textual modalities, enabling fine-grained and content-aware item representations. Meanwhile, a two-layer LightGCN encoder captures high-order collaborative signals by propagating embeddings over the user-item interaction graph without relying on nonlinear transformations.
  We evaluate our model on a real-world dataset from the Amazon product domain. Experimental results demonstrate that RLMultimodalRec consistently outperforms several competitive baselines, including collaborative filtering, visual-aware, and multimodal GNN-based methods. The proposed approach achieves significant improvements in top-K recommendation metrics while maintaining scalability and interpretability, making it suitable for practical deployment.

<title>Adapting Offline Reinforcement Learning with Online Delays</title>

Abstract: Offline-to-online deployment of reinforcement-learning (RL) agents must bridge two gaps: (1) the sim-to-real gap, where real systems add latency and other imperfections not present in simulation, and (2) the interaction gap, where policies trained purely offline face out-of-distribution states during online execution because gathering new interaction data is costly or risky. Agents therefore have to generalize from static, delay-free datasets to dynamic, delay-prone environments. Standard offline RL learns from delay-free logs yet must act under delays that break the Markov assumption and hurt performance. We introduce DT-CORL (Delay-Transformer belief policy Constrained Offline RL), an offline-RL framework built to cope with delayed dynamics at deployment. DT-CORL (i) produces delay-robust actions with a transformer-based belief predictor even though it never sees delayed observations during training, and (ii) is markedly more sample-efficient than na\"ive history-augmentation baselines. Experiments on D4RL benchmarks with several delay settings show that DT-CORL consistently outperforms both history-augmentation and vanilla belief-based methods, narrowing the sim-to-real latency gap while preserving data efficiency.

Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) faces major challenges such as low bandwidth, high latency, mobility, and limited energy resources. Traditional routing protocols like RPL, which were designed for land-based networks, do not perform well in these underwater conditions. This paper introduces RL-RPL-UA, a new routing protocol that uses reinforcement learning to improve performance in underwater environments. Each node includes a lightweight RL agent that selects the best parent node based on local information such as packet delivery ratio, buffer level, link quality, and remaining energy. RL-RPL-UA keeps full compatibility with standard RPL messages and adds a dynamic objective function to support real-time decision-making. Simulations using Aqua-Sim show that RL-RPL-UA increases packet delivery by up to 9.2%, reduces energy use per packet by 14.8%, and extends network lifetime by 80 seconds compared to traditional methods. These results suggest that RL-RPL-UA is a promising and energy-efficient routing solution for underwater networks.

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

Abstract: Autonomy is a hallmark of animal intelligence, enabling adaptive and intelligent behavior in complex environments without relying on external reward or task structure. Existing reinforcement learning approaches to exploration in sparse reward and reward-free environments, including class of methods known as intrinsic motivation, exhibit inconsistent exploration patterns and thus fail to produce robust autonomous behaviors observed in animals. Moreover, systems neuroscience has largely overlooked the neural basis of autonomy, focusing instead on experimental paradigms where animals are motivated by external reward rather than engaging in unconstrained, naturalistic and task-independent behavior. To bridge these gaps, we introduce a novel model-based intrinsic drive explicitly designed to capture robust autonomous exploration observed in animals. Our method (3M-Progress) motivates naturalistic behavior by tracking divergence between the agent's current world model and an ethological prior. We demonstrate that artificial embodied agents trained with 3M-Progress capture the explainable variance in behavioral patterns and whole-brain neural-glial dynamics recorded from autonomously-behaving larval zebrafish, introducing the first goal-driven, population-level model of neural-glial computation. Our findings establish a computational framework connecting model-based intrinsic motivation to naturalistic behavior, providing a foundation for building artificial agents with animal-like autonomy.

Abstract: Architecture evaluation methods have long been used to evaluate software designs. Several evaluation methods have been proposed and used to analyze tradeoffs between different quality attributes. Having competing qualities leads to conflicts for selecting which quality-attribute scenarios are the most suitable ones that an architecture should tackle and for prioritizing the scenarios required by the stakeholders. In this context, architecture evaluation is carried out manually, often involving long brainstorming sessions to decide which are the most adequate quality scenarios. To reduce this effort and make the assessment and selection of scenarios more efficient, we suggest the usage of LLMs to partially automate evaluation activities. As a first step to validate this hypothesis, this work studies MS Copilot as an LLM tool to analyze quality scenarios suggested by students in a software architecture course and compares the students' results with the assessment provided by the LLM. Our initial study reveals that the LLM produces in most cases better and more accurate results regarding the risks, sensitivity points and tradeoff analysis of the quality scenarios. Overall, the use of generative AI has the potential to partially automate and support the architecture evaluation tasks, improving the human decision-making process.

Abstract: Existing paradigms for ensuring AI safety, such as guardrail models and alignment training, often compromise either inference efficiency or development flexibility. We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models, notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails). Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining 98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8 percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall, DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI safety and alignment.

Abstract: Modern AI development pipelines often involve multiple stages-pretraining, fine-tuning rounds, and subsequent adaptation or alignment-with numerous model update steps within each stage. This raises a critical question of accountability: when a deployed model succeeds or fails, which stage is responsible, and to what extent? We pose the problem of accountability attribution, which aims to trace model behavior back to specific stages of the training process. To address this, we propose a general framework that answers counterfactual questions about stage effects: how would the model behavior have changed if the updates from a training stage had not been executed?. Within this framework, we introduce estimators based on first-order approximations that efficiently quantify the stage effects without retraining. Our estimators account for both the training data and key aspects of optimization dynamics, including learning rate schedules, momentum, and weight decay. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach identifies training stages accountable for specific behaviors, offering a practical tool for model analysis and a step toward more accountable AI development.

Abstract: Transducer models have emerged as a promising choice for end-to-end ASR systems, offering a balanced trade-off between recognition accuracy, streaming capabilities, and inference speed in greedy decoding. However, beam search significantly slows down Transducers due to repeated evaluations of key network components, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces a universal method to accelerate beam search for Transducers, enabling the implementation of two optimized algorithms: ALSD++ and AES++. The proposed method utilizes batch operations, a tree-based hypothesis structure, novel blank scoring for enhanced shallow fusion, and CUDA graph execution for efficient GPU inference. This narrows the speed gap between beam and greedy modes to only 10-20% for the whole system, achieves 14-30% relative improvement in WER compared to greedy decoding, and improves shallow fusion for low-resource up to 11% compared to existing implementations. All the algorithms are open sourced.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) excel in modeling complex, multi-typed relationships across diverse domains, yet their vulnerability to backdoor attacks remains unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first investigation into the susceptibility of HGNNs to existing graph backdoor attacks, revealing three critical issues: (1) high attack budget required for effective backdoor injection, (2) inefficient and unreliable backdoor activation, and (3) inaccurate attack effectiveness evaluation. To tackle these issues, we propose the Heterogeneous Graph Backdoor Attack (HGBA), the first backdoor attack specifically designed for HGNNs, introducing a novel relation-based trigger mechanism that establishes specific connections between a strategically selected trigger node and poisoned nodes via the backdoor metapath. HGBA achieves efficient and stealthy backdoor injection with minimal structural modifications and supports easy backdoor activation through two flexible strategies: Self-Node Attack and Indiscriminate Attack. Additionally, we improve the ASR measurement protocol, enabling a more accurate assessment of attack effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HGBA far surpasses multiple state-of-the-art graph backdoor attacks in black-box settings, efficiently attacking HGNNs with low attack budgets. Ablation studies show that the strength of HBGA benefits from our trigger node selection method and backdoor metapath selection strategy. In addition, HGBA shows superior robustness against node feature perturbations and multiple types of existing graph backdoor defense mechanisms. Finally, extension experiments demonstrate that the relation-based trigger mechanism can effectively extend to tasks in homogeneous graph scenarios, thereby posing severe threats to broader security-critical domains.

<title>Let Them Down Easy! Contextual Effects of LLM Guardrails on User Perceptions and Preferences</title>

Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy, reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals. Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent, offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and sustained user engagement.

<title>MOFGPT: Generative Design of Metal-Organic Frameworks using Language Models</title>

Abstract: The discovery of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) with application-specific properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry, owing to the immense size and complexity of their structural design space. Conventional computational screening techniques such as molecular simulations and density functional theory (DFT), while accurate, are computationally prohibitive at scale. Machine learning offers an exciting alternative by leveraging data-driven approaches to accelerate materials discovery. The complexity of MOFs, with their extended periodic structures and diverse topologies, creates both opportunities and challenges for generative modeling approaches. To address these challenges, we present a reinforcement learning-enhanced, transformer-based framework for the de novo design of MOFs. Central to our approach is MOFid, a chemically-informed string representation encoding both connectivity and topology, enabling scalable generative modeling. Our pipeline comprises three components: (1) a generative GPT model trained on MOFid sequences, (2) MOFormer, a transformer-based property predictor, and (3) a reinforcement learning (RL) module that optimizes generated candidates via property-guided reward functions. By integrating property feedback into sequence generation, our method drives the model toward synthesizable, topologically valid MOFs with desired functional attributes. This work demonstrates the potential of large language models, when coupled with reinforcement learning, to accelerate inverse design in reticular chemistry and unlock new frontiers in computational MOF discovery.

<title>The World As Large Language Models See It: Exploring the reliability of LLMs in representing geographical features</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, questions about their trustworthiness in delivering factual information have become increasingly important. This concern also applies to their ability to accurately represent the geographic world. With recent advancements in this field, it is relevant to consider whether and to what extent LLMs' representations of the geographical world can be trusted. This study evaluates the performance of GPT-4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash in three key geospatial tasks: geocoding, elevation estimation, and reverse geocoding. In the geocoding task, both models exhibited systematic and random errors in estimating the coordinates of St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck, Austria, with GPT-4o showing greater deviations and Gemini 2.0 Flash demonstrating more precision but a significant systematic offset. For elevation estimation, both models tended to underestimate elevations across Austria, though they captured overall topographical trends, and Gemini 2.0 Flash performed better in eastern regions. The reverse geocoding task, which involved identifying Austrian federal states from coordinates, revealed that Gemini 2.0 Flash outperformed GPT-4o in overall accuracy and F1-scores, demonstrating better consistency across regions. Despite these findings, neither model achieved an accurate reconstruction of Austria's federal states, highlighting persistent misclassifications. The study concludes that while LLMs can approximate geographic information, their accuracy and reliability are inconsistent, underscoring the need for fine-tuning with geographical information to enhance their utility in GIScience and Geoinformatics.

Abstract: Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) is a common pretraining method for code LLMs, where models complete code segments given surrounding context. However, existing LLMs treat code as plain text and mask random character spans. We propose and evaluate AST-FIM, a pretraining strategy that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to mask complete syntactic structures at scale, ensuring coherent training examples better aligned with universal code structures and common code editing patterns such as blocks, expressions, or functions. To evaluate real-world fill-in-the-middle (FIM) programming tasks, we introduce Real-FIM-Eval, a benchmark derived from 30,000+ GitHub commits across 12 languages. On infilling tasks, experiments on 1B and 8B parameter models show that AST-FIM is particularly beneficial for real-world code editing as it outperforms standard random-character FIM by up to 5 pts on standard FIM benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/gonglinyuan/ast_fim.

Abstract: Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive and large-scale intent classification systems.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization demands accurate and efficient monitoring of turbulent wind patterns to support air quality, climate resilience and infrastructure design. Traditional sparse reconstruction and sensor placement strategies face major accuracy degradations under practical constraints. Here, we introduce Diff-SPORT, a diffusion-based framework for high-fidelity flow reconstruction and optimal sensor placement in urban environments. Diff-SPORT combines a generative diffusion model with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference scheme and a Shapley-value attribution framework to propose a scalable and interpretable solution. Compared to traditional numerical methods, Diff-SPORT achieves significant speedups while maintaining both statistical and instantaneous flow fidelity. Our approach offers a modular, zero-shot alternative to retraining-intensive strategies, supporting fast and reliable urban flow monitoring under extreme sparsity. Diff-SPORT paves the way for integrating generative modeling and explainability in sustainable urban intelligence.

Abstract: Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years; however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal. Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior diffusion-based methods.

<title>Localized LoRA: A Structured Low-Rank Approximation for Efficient Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved performance.

<title>Designing AI Tools for Clinical Care Teams to Support Serious Illness Conversations with Older Adults in the Emergency Department</title>

Abstract: Serious illness conversations (SICs), discussions between clinical care teams and patients with serious, life-limiting illnesses about their values, goals, and care preferences, are critical for patient-centered care. Without these conversations, patients often receive aggressive interventions that may not align with their goals. Clinical care teams face significant barriers when conducting serious illness conversations with older adult patients in Emergency Department (ED) settings, where most older adult patients lack documented treatment goals. To understand current practices and identify AI support opportunities, we conducted interviews with two domain experts and nine ED clinical care team members. Through thematic analysis, we characterized a four-phase serious illness conversation workflow (identification, preparation, conduction, documentation) and identified key needs and challenges at each stage. Clinical care teams struggle with fragmented EHR data access, time constraints, emotional preparation demands, and documentation burdens. While participants expressed interest in AI tools for information synthesis, conversational support, and automated documentation, they emphasized preserving human connection and clinical autonomy. We present design guidelines for AI tools supporting SIC workflows that fit within existing clinical practices. This work contributes empirical understanding of ED-based serious illness conversations and provides design considerations for AI in high-stakes clinical environments.

<title>Aligned but Blind: Alignment Increases Implicit Bias by Reducing Awareness of Race</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.00253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks, raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers. In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans, ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

Abstract: Large language models hold considerable promise for supporting forensic investigations, but their widespread adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, explainability, and reproducibility. This paper explores how the emerging Model Context Protocol can address these challenges and support the meaningful use of LLMs in digital forensics. Through a theoretical analysis, we examine how MCP can be integrated across various forensic scenarios - ranging from artifact analysis to the generation of interpretable reports. We also outline both technical and conceptual considerations for deploying an MCP server in forensic environments. Our analysis reveals a wide range of use cases in which MCP not only strengthens existing forensic workflows but also facilitates the application of LLMs to areas of forensics where their use was previously limited. Furthermore, we introduce the concept of the inference constraint level - a way of characterizing how specific MCP design choices can deliberately constrain model behavior, thereby enhancing both auditability and traceability. Our insights demonstrate that MCP has significant potential as a foundational component for developing LLM-assisted forensic workflows that are not only more transparent, reproducible, and legally defensible, but also represent a step toward increased automation in digital forensic analysis. However, we also highlight potential challenges that the adoption of MCP may pose for digital forensics in the future.

Abstract: Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly, rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson $\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and overarching themes within real-world news datasets.

We analyze these threats under risk management lens, and propose robust prioritized control list that includes risk-mitigating actions like input validation, adversarial training, and real-time monitoring.

Abstract: In this paper we analyze the sample complexities of learning the optimal state-action value function $Q^*$ and an optimal policy $\pi^*$ in a discounted Markov decision process (MDP) where the agent has recursive entropic risk-preferences with risk-parameter $\beta\neq 0$ and where a generative model of the MDP is available. We provide and analyze a simple model based approach which we call model-based risk-sensitive $Q$-value-iteration (MB-RS-QVI) which leads to $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC-bounds on $\|Q^*-Q^k\|$, and $\|V^*-V^{\pi_k}\|$ where $Q_k$ is the output of MB-RS-QVI after k iterations and $\pi_k$ is the greedy policy with respect to $Q_k$. Both PAC-bounds have exponential dependence on the effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ and the strength of this dependence grows with the learners risk-sensitivity $|\beta|$. We also provide two lower bounds which shows that exponential dependence on $|\beta|\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$ is unavoidable in both cases. The lower bounds reveal that the PAC-bounds are both tight in $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ and that the PAC-bound on $Q$-learning is tight in the number of actions $A$, and that the PAC-bound on policy-learning is nearly tight in $A$.

<title>Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models under Continued Pretraining for Language Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in the future.

Abstract: Protein sequence design methods have demonstrated strong performance in sequence generation for de novo protein design. However, as the training objective was sequence recovery, it does not guarantee designability--the likelihood that a designed sequence folds into the desired structure. To bridge this gap, we redefine the training objective by steering sequence generation toward high designability. To do this, we integrate Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), using AlphaFold pLDDT scores as the preference signal, which significantly improves the in silico design success rate. To further refine sequence generation at a finer, residue-level granularity, we introduce Residue-level Designability Preference Optimization (ResiDPO), which applies residue-level structural rewards and decouples optimization across residues. This enables direct improvement in designability while preserving regions that already perform well. Using a curated dataset with residue-level annotations, we fine-tune LigandMPNN with ResiDPO to obtain EnhancedMPNN, which achieves a nearly 3-fold increase in in silico design success rate (from 6.56% to 17.57%) on a challenging enzyme design benchmark.

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\% and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would likely erase the gap entirely.

Abstract: Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts, we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and platform moderation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews, suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews. We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0 captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

It includes three popular marginal models -- PrivBayes, MST, and AIM -- that achieve superior utility and offer richer functionality compared to alternative implementations. Additionally, we adopt best practices to provide end-to-end DP guarantees and address well-known DP-related vulnerabilities. Our goal is to accommodate a wide audience with easy-to-install, highly customizable, and robust model implementations.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in latent diffusion models that generate high-dimensional image data and perform various downstream tasks, there has been little exploration into perceptual consistency within these models on the task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). In this paper, we hypothesize that latent diffusion models implicitly exhibit perceptually consistent local regions within the data manifold. We leverage this insight to guide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements. Specifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to obtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from the denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures exhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks. Our method can be applied to any existing pretrained latent diffusion model and is straightforward to integrate. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work on guiding diffusion model with perceptual features for NR-IQA. Extensive experiments on IQA datasets show that our method, LGDM, achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the superior generalization capabilities of diffusion models for NR-IQA tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at \texttt{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}.

Abstract: Selection bias, arising from the systematic inclusion or exclusion of certain samples, poses a significant challenge to the validity of causal inference. While Bareinboim et al. introduced methods for recovering unbiased observational and interventional distributions from biased data using partial external information, the complexity of the backdoor adjustment and the method's strong reliance on observational data limit its applicability in many practical settings. In this paper, we formally discover the recoverability of $P(Y^*_{x^*})$ under selection bias with experimental data. By explicitly constructing counterfactual worlds via Structural Causal Models (SCMs), we analyze how selection mechanisms in the observational world propagate to the counterfactual domain. We derive a complete set of graphical and theoretical criteria to determine that the experimental distribution remain unaffected by selection bias. Furthermore, we propose principled methods for leveraging partially unbiased observational data to recover $P(Y^*_{x^*})$ from biased experimental datasets. Simulation studies replicating realistic research scenarios demonstrate the practical utility of our approach, offering concrete guidance for mitigating selection bias in applied causal inference.

<title>Efficient Latent Semantic Clustering for Scaling Test-Time Computation of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering (LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

<title>Beyond Winning: Margin of Victory Relative to Expectation Unlocks Accurate Skill Ratings</title>

Abstract: Knowledge of accurate relative skills in any competitive system is essential, but foundational approaches such as ELO discard extremely relevant performance data by concentrating exclusively on binary outcomes. While margin of victory (MOV) extensions exist, they often lack a definitive method for incorporating this information. We introduce Margin of Victory Differential Analysis (MOVDA), a framework that enhances traditional rating systems by using the deviation between the true MOV and a $\textit{modeled expectation}$. MOVDA learns a domain-specific, non-linear function (a scaled hyperbolic tangent that captures saturation effects and home advantage) to predict expected MOV based on rating differentials. Crucially, the $\textit{difference}$ between the true and expected MOV provides a subtle and weighted signal for rating updates, highlighting informative deviations in all levels of contests. Extensive experiments on professional NBA basketball data (from 2013 to 2023, with 13,619 games) show that MOVDA significantly outperforms standard ELO and Bayesian baselines. MOVDA reduces Brier score prediction error by $1.54\%$ compared to TrueSkill, increases outcome accuracy by $0.58\%$, and most importantly accelerates rating convergence by $13.5\%$, while maintaining the computational efficiency of the original ELO updates. MOVDA offers a theoretically motivated, empirically superior, and computationally lean approach to integrating performance magnitude into skill rating for competitive environments like the NBA.

Abstract: Many large enterprises that operate highly governed and complex ICT environments have no efficient and effective way to support their Data and AI teams in rapidly spinning up and tearing down self-service data and compute infrastructure, to experiment with new data analytic tools, and deploy data products into operational use. This paper proposes a key piece of the solution to the overall problem, in the form of an on-demand self-service data-platform infrastructure to empower de-centralised data teams to build data products on top of centralised templates, policies and governance. The core innovation is an efficient method to leverage immutable container operating systems and infrastructure-as-code methodologies for creating, from scratch, vendor-neutral and short-lived Kubernetes clusters on-premises and in any cloud environment. Our proposed approach can serve as a repeatable, portable and cost-efficient alternative or complement to commercial Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings, and this is particularly important in supporting interoperability in complex data mesh environments with a mix of modern and legacy compute infrastructure.

This paper explores further experiments from the original publication, generated from a hackathon held at the Carnegie Mellon Swartz Center in February 2025. Students and local Pittsburgh ML practitioners were brought together to experiment with the Perforated Backpropagation algorithm on the datasets and models which they were using for their projects. Results showed that the system could enhance their projects, with up to 90% model compression without negative impact on accuracy, or up to 16% increased accuracy of their original models.

Abstract: While recent audio-visual models have demonstrated impressive performance, their robustness to distributional shifts at test-time remains not fully understood. Existing robustness benchmarks mainly focus on single modalities, making them insufficient for thoroughly assessing the robustness of audio-visual models. Motivated by real-world scenarios where shifts can occur $\textit{simultaneously}$ in both audio and visual modalities, we introduce $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the test-time robustness of audio-visual recognition models. $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ comprises four audio-visual benchmark datasets, $\texttt{AUDIOSET-2C}$, $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$, $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, and $\texttt{EPICKITCHENS-2C}$, each incorporating 75 bimodal audio-visual corruptions that are $\textit{co-occurring}$ and $\textit{correlated}$. Through extensive evaluations, we observe that state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised audio-visual models exhibit declining robustness as corruption severity increases. Furthermore, online test-time adaptation (TTA) methods, on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$ and $\texttt{KINETICS-2C}$, offer minimal improvements in performance under bimodal corruptions. We further propose $\texttt{AV2C}$, a simple TTA approach enabling on-the-fly cross-modal fusion by penalizing high-entropy samples, which achieves improvements on $\texttt{VGGSOUND-2C}$. We hope that $\texttt{AVROBUSTBENCH}$ will steer the development of more effective and robust audio-visual TTA approaches. Our code is available $\href{https://github.com/sarthaxxxxx/AV-C-Robustness-Benchmark}{here}$.

Abstract: Neural network (NN)-based end-to-end (E2E) communication systems, in which each system component may consist of a portion of a neural network, have been investigated as potential tools for developing artificial intelligence (Al)-native E2E systems. In this paper, we propose an NN-based bitwise receiver that improves computational efficiency while maintaining performance comparable to baseline demappers. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel symbol-wise autoencoder (AE)-based E2E system that jointly optimizes the transmitter and receiver at the physical layer. We evaluate the proposed NN-based receiver using bit-error rate (BER) analysis to confirm that the numerical BER achieved by NN-based receivers or transceivers is accurate. Results demonstrate that the AE-based system outperforms baseline architectures, particularly for higher-order modulation schemes. We further show that the training signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly affects the performance of the systems when inference is conducted at different SNR levels.

Abstract: Neural audio codecs have made significant strides in efficiently mapping raw audio waveforms into discrete token representations, which are foundational for contemporary audio generative models. However, most existing codecs are optimized primarily for reconstruction quality, often at the expense of the downstream modelability of the encoded tokens. Motivated by the need to overcome this bottleneck, we introduce $\textbf{MagiCodec}$, a novel single-layer, streaming Transformer-based audio codec. MagiCodec is designed with a multistage training pipeline that incorporates Gaussian noise injection and latent regularization, explicitly targeting the enhancement of semantic expressiveness in the generated codes while preserving high reconstruction fidelity. We analytically derive the effect of noise injection in the frequency domain, demonstrating its efficacy in attenuating high-frequency components and fostering robust tokenization. Extensive experimental evaluations show that MagiCodec surpasses state-of-the-art codecs in both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks. Notably, the tokens produced by MagiCodec exhibit Zipf-like distributions, as observed in natural languages, thereby improving compatibility with language-model-based generative architectures. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Ereboas/MagiCodec.

Abstract: As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models (LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates (or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks - TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

<title>Bias as a Virtue: Rethinking Generalization under Distribution Shifts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Machine learning models often degrade when deployed on data distributions different from their training data. Challenging conventional validation paradigms, we demonstrate that higher in-distribution (ID) bias can lead to better out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. Our Adaptive Distribution Bridge (ADB) framework implements this insight by introducing controlled statistical diversity during training, enabling models to develop bias profiles that effectively generalize across distributions. Empirically, we observe a robust negative correlation where higher ID bias corresponds to lower OOD error--a finding that contradicts standard practices focused on minimizing validation error. Evaluation on multiple datasets shows our approach significantly improves OOD generalization. ADB achieves robust mean error reductions of up to 26.8% compared to traditional cross-validation, and consistently identifies high-performing training strategies, evidenced by percentile ranks often exceeding 74.4%. Our work provides both a practical method for improving generalization and a theoretical framework for reconsidering the role of bias in robust machine learning.

<title>LoHoVLA: A Unified Vision-Language-Action Model for Long-Horizon Embodied Tasks</title>

Abstract: Real-world embodied agents face long-horizon tasks, characterized by high-level goals demanding multi-step solutions beyond single actions. Successfully navigating these requires both high-level task planning (i.e., decomposing goals into sub-tasks) and low-level motion control (i.e., generating precise robot actions). While existing vision language action (VLA) models and hierarchical architectures offer potential in embodied tasks, the former often falter in planning, and the latter can suffer from coordination issues, both hampering performance. We introduce a new unified VLA framework for long-horizon tasks, dubbed LoHoVLA, to overcome these limitations. LoHoVLA leverages a large pretrained vision language model (VLM) as the backbone to jointly generate language and action tokens for sub-task generation and robot action prediction, respectively. This shared representation promotes better generalization across tasks. Additionally, LoHoVLA embraces a hierarchical closed-loop control mechanism to mitigate errors originating from both high-level planning and low-level control. To train LoHoVLA, we introduce LoHoSet, a dataset built on the Ravens simulator, containing 20 long-horizon tasks, each with 1,000 expert demonstrations composed of visual observations, linguistic goals, sub-tasks, and robot actions. Experimental results show that LoHoVLA significantly surpasses both hierarchical and standard VLA approaches on long-horizon embodied tasks in the Ravens simulator. These findings underscore the promise of unified architectures for advancing generalizable embodied intelligence.

Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding, where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more powerful and pervasive across society, ensuring these systems are beneficial, safe, and aligned with human values is crucial. Current alignment techniques, like Constitutional AI (CAI), involve complex iterative processes. This paper argues that the Method of Wide Reflective Equilibrium (MWRE) -- a well-established coherentist moral methodology -- offers a uniquely apt framework for understanding current LLM alignment efforts. Moreover, this methodology can substantively augment these processes by providing concrete pathways for improving their dynamic revisability, procedural legitimacy, and overall ethical grounding. Together, these enhancements can help produce more robust and ethically defensible outcomes. MWRE, emphasizing the achievement of coherence between our considered moral judgments, guiding moral principles, and relevant background theories, arguably better represents the intricate reality of LLM alignment and offers a more robust path to justification than prevailing foundationalist models or simplistic input-output evaluations. While current methods like CAI bear a structural resemblance to MWRE, they often lack its crucial emphasis on dynamic, bi-directional revision of principles and the procedural legitimacy derived from such a process. While acknowledging various disanalogies (e.g., consciousness, genuine understanding in LLMs), the paper demonstrates that MWRE serves as a valuable heuristic for critically analyzing current alignment efforts and for guiding the future development of more ethically sound and justifiably aligned AI systems.

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models (LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are extremely high.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in the data collected by WSNs can provide crucial evidence for assessing the reliability and stability of WSNs. Existing methods for WSN anomaly detection often face challenges such as the limited extraction of spatiotemporal correlation features, the absence of sample labels, few anomaly samples, and an imbalanced sample distribution. To address these issues, a spatiotemporal correlation detection model (MTAD-RD) considering both model architecture and a two-stage training strategy perspective is proposed. In terms of model structure design, the proposed MTAD-RD backbone network includes a retentive network (RetNet) enhanced by a cross-retention (CR) module, a multigranular feature fusion module, and a graph attention network module to extract internode correlation information. This proposed model can integrate the intermodal correlation features and spatial features of WSN neighbor nodes while extracting global information from time series data. Moreover, its serialized inference characteristic can remarkably reduce inference overhead. For model training, a two-stage training approach was designed. First, a contrastive learning proxy task was designed for time series data with graph structure information in WSNs, enabling the backbone network to learn transferable features from unlabeled data using unsupervised contrastive learning methods, thereby addressing the issue of missing sample labels in the dataset. Then, a caching-based sample sampler was designed to divide samples into few-shot and contrastive learning data. A specific joint loss function was developed to jointly train the dual-graph discriminator network to address the problem of sample imbalance effectively. In experiments carried out on real public datasets, the designed MTAD-RD anomaly detection method achieved an F1 score of 90.97%, outperforming existing supervised WSN anomaly detection methods.

<title>Enabling Chatbots with Eyes and Ears: An Immersive Multimodal Conversation System for Dynamic Interactions</title>

Abstract: As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions, multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far, efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions, placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears", namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset, Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model, trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

Abstract: Sparse tensor programs are essential in deep learning and graph analytics, driving the need for optimized processing. To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and 1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.

Abstract: Channel identifiability (CID) refers to the ability to distinguish between individual channels in time series (TS) modeling. The absence of CID often results in producing identical outputs for identical inputs, disregarding channel-specific characteristics. In this paper, we highlight the importance of CID and propose Channel Normalization (CN), a simple yet effective normalization strategy that enhances CID by assigning distinct affine transformation parameters to each channel. We further extend CN in two ways: 1) Adaptive CN (ACN) dynamically adjusts parameters based on the input TS, improving adaptability in TS models, and 2) Prototypical CN (PCN) introduces a set of learnable prototypes instead of per-channel parameters, enabling applicability to datasets with unknown or varying number of channels and facilitating use in TS foundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CN and its variants by applying them to various TS models, achieving significant performance gains for both non-CID and CID models. In addition, we analyze the success of our approach from an information theory perspective. Code is available at https://github.com/seunghan96/CN.

Abstract: In this study, we propose a method for identifying potential customers in targeted marketing by applying learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning). We consider a scenario in which a company sells a product and can observe only the customers who purchased it. Decision-makers seek to market products effectively based on whether people have loyalty to the company. Individuals with loyalty are those who are likely to remain interested in the company even without additional advertising. Consequently, those loyal customers would likely purchase from the company if they are interested in the product. In contrast, people with lower loyalty may overlook the product or buy similar products from other companies unless they receive marketing attention. Therefore, by focusing marketing efforts on individuals who are interested in the product but do not have strong loyalty, we can achieve more efficient marketing. To achieve this goal, we consider how to learn, from limited data, a classifier that identifies potential customers who (i) have interest in the product and (ii) do not have loyalty to the company. Although our algorithm comprises a single-stage optimization, its objective function implicitly contains two losses derived from standard PU learning settings. For this reason, we refer to our approach as double PU learning. We verify the validity of the proposed algorithm through numerical experiments, confirming that it functions appropriately for the problem at hand.

Abstract: Explaining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has garnered significant attention due to the need for interpretability, enabling users to understand the behavior of these black-box models better and extract valuable insights from their predictions. While numerous post-hoc instance-level explanation methods have been proposed to interpret GNN predictions, the reliability of these explanations remains uncertain, particularly in the out-of-distribution or unknown test datasets. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing an explainer framework with the confidence scoring module ( ConfExplainer), grounded in theoretical principle, which is generalized graph information bottleneck with confidence constraint (GIB-CC), that quantifies the reliability of generated explanations. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, highlighting the effectiveness of the confidence score in enhancing the trustworthiness and robustness of GNN explanations.

Abstract: Ensembling large language models (LLMs) can effectively combine diverse strengths of different models, offering a promising approach to enhance performance across various tasks. However, existing methods typically rely on fixed weighting strategies that fail to adapt to the dynamic, context-dependent characteristics of LLM capabilities. In this work, we propose Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Ensemble for LLMs (RLAE), a novel framework that reformulates LLM ensemble through the lens of a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our approach introduces a RL agent that dynamically adjusts ensemble weights by considering both input context and intermediate generation states, with the agent being trained using rewards that directly correspond to the quality of final outputs. We implement RLAE using both single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms ($\text{RLAE}_\text{PPO}$ and $\text{RLAE}_\text{MAPPO}$ ), demonstrating substantial improvements over conventional ensemble methods. Extensive evaluations on a diverse set of tasks show that RLAE outperforms existing approaches by up to $3.3\%$ accuracy points, offering a more effective framework for LLM ensembling. Furthermore, our method exhibits superior generalization capabilities across different tasks without the need for retraining, while simultaneously achieving lower time latency.

<title>Attention-Aided MMSE for OFDM Channel Estimation: Learning Linear Filters with Attention</title>

Abstract: In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), accurate channel estimation is crucial. Classical signal processing based approaches, such as minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) estimation, often require second-order statistics that are difficult to obtain in practice. Recent deep neural networks based methods have been introduced to address this; yet they often suffer from high complexity. This paper proposes an Attention-aided MMSE (A-MMSE), a novel model-based DNN framework that learns the optimal MMSE filter via the Attention Transformer. Once trained, the A-MMSE estimates the channel through a single linear operation for channel estimation, eliminating nonlinear activations during inference and thus reducing computational complexity. To enhance the learning efficiency of the A-MMSE, we develop a two-stage Attention encoder, designed to effectively capture the channel correlation structure. Additionally, a rank-adaptive extension of the proposed A-MMSE allows flexible trade-offs between complexity and channel estimation accuracy. Extensive simulations with 3GPP TDL channel models demonstrate that the proposed A-MMSE consistently outperforms other baseline methods in terms of normalized MSE across a wide range of SNR conditions. In particular, the A-MMSE and its rank-adaptive extension establish a new frontier in the performance complexity trade-off, redefining the standard for practical channel estimation methods.

Abstract: Dynamic graphs evolve continuously, presenting challenges for traditional graph learning due to their changing structures and temporal dependencies. Recent advancements have shown potential in addressing these challenges by developing suitable meta-learning-based dynamic graph neural network models. However, most meta-learning approaches for dynamic graphs rely on fixed weight update parameters, neglecting the essential intrinsic complex high-order topological information of dynamically evolving graphs. We have designed Dowker Zigzag Persistence (DZP), an efficient and stable dynamic graph persistent homology representation method based on Dowker complex and zigzag persistence, to capture the high-order features of dynamic graphs. Armed with the DZP ideas, we propose TMetaNet, a new meta-learning parameter update model based on dynamic topological features. By utilizing the distances between high-order topological features, TMetaNet enables more effective adaptation across snapshots. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate TMetaNet's state-of-the-art performance and resilience to graph noise, illustrating its high potential for meta-learning and dynamic graph analysis. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lihaogx/TMetaNet.

Abstract: Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines with vision-language models (VLMs) This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and the training data of VLMs, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors which emulate human olfactory recognition through electronic sensor arrays. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making in environments where olfactory cues are essential. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of robotic olfaction, offering a scalable solution to the challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

Abstract: Hanabi has become a popular game for research when it comes to reinforcement learning (RL) as it is one of the few cooperative card games where you have incomplete knowledge of the entire environment, thus presenting a challenge for a RL agent. We explored different tabular and deep reinforcement learning algorithms to see which had the best performance both against an agent of the same type and also against other types of agents. We establish that certain agents played their highest scoring games against specific agents while others exhibited higher scores on average by adapting to the opposing agent's behavior. We attempted to quantify the conditions under which each algorithm provides the best advantage and identified the most interesting interactions between agents of different types. In the end, we found that temporal difference (TD) algorithms had better overall performance and balancing of play types compared to tabular agents. Specifically, tabular Expected SARSA and deep Q-Learning agents showed the best performance.

Abstract: We aim to better understand the tradeoffs between traditional and reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for energy storage management. More specifically, we wish to better understand the performance loss incurred when using a generative RL policy instead of using a traditional approach to find optimal control policies for specific instances. Our comparison is based on a simplified micro-grid model, that includes a load component, a photovoltaic source, and a storage device. Based on this model, we examine three use cases of increasing complexity: ideal storage with convex cost functions, lossy storage devices, and lossy storage devices with convex transmission losses. With the aim of promoting the principled use RL based methods in this challenging and important domain, we provide a detailed formulation of each use case and a detailed description of the optimization challenges. We then compare the performance of traditional and RL methods, discuss settings in which it is beneficial to use each method, and suggest avenues for future investigation.

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes, making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft, and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue, with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors, which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated exceptional performance in supervised learning, benefiting from abundant high-quality annotated data. However, obtaining such data in real-world scenarios is costly and labor-intensive. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to this problem. Recent studies, such as Semi-ViT and Noisy Student, which employ consistency regularization or pseudo-labeling, have demonstrated significant achievements. However, they still face challenges, particularly in accurately selecting sufficient high-quality pseudo-labels due to their reliance on fixed thresholds. Recent methods such as FlexMatch and FreeMatch have introduced flexible or self-adaptive thresholding techniques, greatly advancing SSL research. Nonetheless, their process of updating thresholds at each iteration is deemed time-consuming, computationally intensive, and potentially unnecessary. To address these issues, we propose Self-training with Self-adaptive Thresholding (SST), a novel, effective, and efficient SSL framework. SST introduces an innovative Self-Adaptive Thresholding (SAT) mechanism that adaptively adjusts class-specific thresholds based on the model's learning progress. SAT ensures the selection of high-quality pseudo-labeled data, mitigating the risks of inaccurate pseudo-labels and confirmation bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SST achieves state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency, generalization, and scalability across various architectures and datasets. Semi-SST-ViT-Huge achieves the best results on competitive ImageNet-1K SSL benchmarks, with 80.7% / 84.9% Top-1 accuracy using only 1% / 10% labeled data. Compared to the fully-supervised DeiT-III-ViT-Huge, which achieves 84.8% Top-1 accuracy using 100% labeled data, our method demonstrates superior performance using only 10% labeled data.

Abstract: Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images. To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset, comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized visual persuasion.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in the research and deployment of large language models (LLMs), the statistical distribution of model parameters, as well as their influence on initialization, training dynamics, and downstream efficiency, has received surprisingly little attention. A recent work introduced BackSlash, a training-time compression algorithm. It first demonstrated that pre-trained LLM parameters follow generalized Gaussian distributions (GGDs) better. By optimizing GG priors during training, BackSlash can reduce parameters by up to 90\% with minimal performance loss. Building on this foundational insight, we propose a unified, end-to-end framework for LLM optimization based on the GG model. Our contributions are threefold: (1) GG-based initialization scheme that aligns with the statistical structure of trained models, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy; (2) DeepShape, a post-training regularization method that reshapes weight distributions to match a GG profile, improving compressibility with minimized degradation in performance; and (3) RF8, a compact and hardware-efficient 8-bit floating-point format designed for GG-distributed-initialized BackSlash training, enabling low-cost inference without compromising accuracy. Experiments across diverse model architectures show that our framework consistently yields smaller and faster models that match or outperform standard training baselines. By grounding LLM development in principled statistical modeling, this work forges a new path toward efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware AI systems. The code is available on our project page: https://huggingface.co/spaces/shifeng3711/gg_prior.

<title>Multi-Objective Neural Network Assisted Design Optimization of Soft Fin-Ray Grippers for Enhanced Grasping Performance</title>

Abstract: Soft Fin-Ray grippers can perform delicate and careful manipulation, which has caused notable attention in different fields. These grippers can handle objects of various forms and sizes safely. The internal structure of the Fin-Ray finger plays a significant role in its adaptability and grasping performance. However, modeling the non-linear grasp force and deformation behaviors for design purposes is challenging. Moreover, when the Fin-Ray finger becomes more rigid and capable of exerting higher forces, it becomes less delicate in handling objects. The contrast between these two objectives gives rise to a multi-objective optimization problem. In this study, we employ finite element method (FEM) to estimate the deflections and contact forces of the Fin-Ray, grasping cylindrical objects. This dataset is then used to construct a multilayer perception (MLP) for prediction of the contact force and the tip displacement. The FEM dataset consists of three input and four target features. The three input features of the MLP and optimization design variables are the thickness of the front and supporting beams, the thickness of the cross beams, and the equal spacing between the cross beams. In addition, the target features are the maximum contact forces and maximum tip displacements in x- and y-directions. The magnitude of maximum contact force and magnitude of maximum tip displacement are the two objectives, showing the trade-off between force and delicate manipulation in soft Fin-Ray grippers. Furthermore, the optimized set of solutions are found using multi-objective optimal techniques. We use non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) method for this purpose. Our findings demonstrate that our methodologies can be used to improve the design and gripping performance of soft robotic grippers, helping us to choose a design not only for delicate grasping but also for high-force applications.

Abstract: Text-guided 3D editing aims to precisely edit semantically relevant local 3D regions, which has significant potential for various practical applications ranging from 3D games to film production. Existing methods typically follow a view-indiscriminate paradigm: editing 2D views indiscriminately and projecting them back into 3D space. However, they overlook the different cross-view interdependencies, resulting in inconsistent multi-view editing. In this study, we argue that ideal consistent 3D editing can be achieved through a \textit{progressive-views paradigm}, which propagates editing semantics from the editing-salient view to other editing-sparse views. Specifically, we propose \textit{Pro3D-Editor}, a novel framework, which mainly includes Primary-view Sampler, Key-view Render, and Full-view Refiner. Primary-view Sampler dynamically samples and edits the most editing-salient view as the primary view. Key-view Render accurately propagates editing semantics from the primary view to other key views through its Mixture-of-View-Experts Low-Rank Adaption (MoVE-LoRA). Full-view Refiner edits and refines the 3D object based on the edited multi-views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in editing accuracy and spatial consistency.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings. Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language (\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings, outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic and commonsense knowledge QA tasks.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property (IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental results on a Taiwan patent Q&amp;A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid, cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment. A demo version of the instantiated is available at https://github.com/renruntao/patent_rag.

Abstract: The integration of wind energy into power grids necessitates accurate ultra-short-term wind power forecasting to ensure grid stability and optimize resource allocation. This study introduces M2WLLM, an innovative model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for predicting wind power output at granular time intervals. M2WLLM overcomes the limitations of traditional and deep learning methods by seamlessly integrating textual information and temporal numerical data, significantly improving wind power forecasting accuracy through multi-modal data. Its architecture features a Prompt Embedder and a Data Embedder, enabling an effective fusion of textual prompts and numerical inputs within the LLMs framework. The Semantic Augmenter within the Data Embedder translates temporal data into a format that the LLMs can comprehend, enabling it to extract latent features and improve prediction accuracy. The empirical evaluations conducted on wind farm data from three Chinese provinces demonstrate that M2WLLM consistently outperforms existing methods, such as GPT4TS, across various datasets and prediction horizons. The results highlight LLMs' ability to enhance accuracy and robustness in ultra-short-term forecasting and showcase their strong few-shot learning capabilities.

Abstract: The choice of a suitable visual language projector (VLP) is critical to the successful training of large visual language models (LVLMs). Mainstream VLPs can be broadly categorized into compressed and uncompressed projectors, and each offering distinct advantages in performance and computational efficiency. However, their security implications have not been thoroughly examined. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant differences in their security profiles: compressed projectors exhibit substantial vulnerabilities, allowing adversaries to successfully compromise LVLMs even with minimal knowledge of structural information. In stark contrast, uncompressed projectors demonstrate robust security properties and do not introduce additional vulnerabilities. These findings provide critical guidance for researchers in selecting optimal VLPs that enhance the security and reliability of visual language models. The code will be released.

<title>Decoupling Reasoning and Knowledge Injection for In-Context Knowledge Editing</title>

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end, we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency.

Abstract: Missing data is a relevant issue in time series, especially in biomedical sequences such as those corresponding to smooth pursuit eye movements, which often contain gaps due to eye blinks and track losses, complicating the analysis and extraction of meaningful biomarkers. In this paper, a novel imputation framework is proposed using Self-Attention-based Imputation networks for time series, which leverages the power of deep learning and self-attention mechanisms to impute missing data. We further refine the imputed data using a custom made autoencoder, tailored to represent smooth pursuit eye movement sequences. The proposed approach was implemented using 5,504 sequences from 172 Parkinsonian patients and healthy controls. Results show a significant improvement in the accuracy of reconstructed eye movement sequences with respect to other state of the art techniques, substantially reducing the values for common time domain error metrics such as the mean absolute error, mean relative error, and root mean square error, while also preserving the signal's frequency domain characteristics. Moreover, it demonstrates robustness when large intervals of data are missing. This method offers an alternative solution for robustly handling missing data in time series, enhancing the reliability of smooth pursuit analysis for the screening and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders.

Abstract: Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional, multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/MSumBench.

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents (CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios, to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges: dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues, enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual, demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed and screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent.

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance. Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns. Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised fine-tuning baselines.

Abstract: A key approach to state abstraction is approximating behavioral metrics (notably, bisimulation metrics) in the observation space and embedding these learned distances in the representation space. While promising for robustness to task-irrelevant noise, as shown in prior work, accurately estimating these metrics remains challenging, requiring various design choices that create gaps between theory and practice. Prior evaluations focus mainly on final returns, leaving the quality of learned metrics and the source of performance gains unclear. To systematically assess how metric learning works in deep reinforcement learning (RL), we evaluate five recent approaches, unified conceptually as isometric embeddings with varying design choices. We benchmark them with baselines across 20 state-based and 14 pixel-based tasks, spanning 370 task configurations with diverse noise settings. Beyond final returns, we introduce the evaluation of a denoising factor to quantify the encoder's ability to filter distractions. To further isolate the effect of metric learning, we propose and evaluate an isolated metric estimation setting, in which the encoder is influenced solely by the metric loss. Finally, we release an open-source, modular codebase to improve reproducibility and support future research on metric learning in deep RL.

Abstract: Modern wireless networks must adapt to dynamic conditions while efficiently managing diverse service demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) struggles in these environments, as scattered and evolving feedback makes optimal decision-making challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution by structuring unorganized network feedback into meaningful latent representations, helping RL agents recognize patterns more effectively. For example, in O-RAN slicing, concepts like SNR, power levels and throughput are semantically related, and LLMs can naturally cluster them, providing a more interpretable state representation. To leverage this capability, we introduce a contextualization-based adaptation method that integrates learnable prompts into an LLM-augmented DRL framework. Instead of relying on full model fine-tuning, we refine state representations through task-specific prompts that dynamically adjust to network conditions. Utilizing ORANSight, an LLM trained on O-RAN knowledge, we develop Prompt-Augmented Multi agent RL (PA-MRL) framework. Learnable prompts optimize both semantic clustering and RL objectives, allowing RL agents to achieve higher rewards in fewer iterations and adapt more efficiently. By incorporating prompt-augmented learning, our approach enables faster, more scalable, and adaptive resource allocation in O-RAN slicing. Experimental results show that it accelerates convergence and outperforms other baselines.

Abstract: Advanced wireless networks must support highly dynamic and heterogeneous service demands. Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture enables this flexibility by adopting modular, disaggregated components, such as the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), Centralized Unit (CU), and Distributed Unit (DU), that can support intelligent control via machine learning (ML). While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful tool for managing dynamic resource allocation and slicing, it often struggles to process raw, unstructured input like RF features, QoS metrics, and traffic trends. These limitations hinder policy generalization and decision efficiency in partially observable and evolving environments. To address this, we propose \textit{ORAN-GUIDE}, a dual-LLM framework that enhances multi-agent RL (MARL) with task-relevant, semantically enriched state representations. The architecture employs a domain-specific language model, ORANSight, pretrained on O-RAN control and configuration data, to generate structured, context-aware prompts. These prompts are fused with learnable tokens and passed to a frozen GPT-based encoder that outputs high-level semantic representations for DRL agents. This design adopts a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) style pipeline tailored for technical decision-making in wireless systems. Experimental results show that ORAN-GUIDE improves sample efficiency, policy convergence, and performance generalization over standard MARL and single-LLM baselines.

Abstract: In this pilot study, we propose a neuro-inspired approach that compresses temporal sequences into context-tagged chunks, where each tag represents a recurring structural unit or``community'' in the sequence. These tags are generated during an offline sleep phase and serve as compact references to past experience, allowing the learner to incorporate information beyond its immediate input range. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. We evaluate this idea in a controlled synthetic environment designed to reveal the limitations of traditional neural network based sequence learners, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), when facing temporal patterns on multiple timescales. Our results, while preliminary, suggest that temporal chunking can significantly enhance learning efficiency under resource constrained settings. A small-scale human pilot study using a Serial Reaction Time Task further motivates the idea of structural abstraction. Although limited to synthetic tasks, this work serves as an early proof-of-concept, with initial evidence that learned context tags can transfer across related task, offering potential for future applications in transfer learning.

Abstract: Plasticity, or the ability of an agent to adapt to new tasks, environments, or distributions, is crucial for continual learning. In this paper, we study the loss of plasticity in deep continual RL from the lens of churn: network output variability for out-of-batch data induced by mini-batch training. We demonstrate that (1) the loss of plasticity is accompanied by the exacerbation of churn due to the gradual rank decrease of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) matrix; (2) reducing churn helps prevent rank collapse and adjusts the step size of regular RL gradients adaptively. Moreover, we introduce Continual Churn Approximated Reduction (C-CHAIN) and demonstrate it improves learning performance and outperforms baselines in a diverse range of continual learning environments on OpenAI Gym Control, ProcGen, DeepMind Control Suite, and MinAtar benchmarks.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection faces significant challenges due to the scarcity of reliable anomaly-labeled datasets, driving the development of unsupervised methods. Graph autoencoders (GAEs) have emerged as a dominant approach by reconstructing graph structures and node features while deriving anomaly scores from reconstruction errors. However, relying solely on reconstruction error for anomaly detection has limitations, as it increases the sensitivity to noise and overfitting. To address these issues, we propose Graph Evidential Learning (GEL), a probabilistic framework that redefines the reconstruction process through evidential learning. By modeling node features and graph topology using evidential distributions, GEL quantifies two types of uncertainty: graph uncertainty and reconstruction uncertainty, incorporating them into the anomaly scoring mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GEL achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high robustness against noise and structural perturbations.

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models to specific users or concepts remains challenging, particularly when only a few reference images are available. Existing methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit to limited data, causing misalignment between generated images and text prompts when attempting to balance identity fidelity with prompt adherence. While Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) with its consistency-guided sampling partially alleviates this issue, it still struggles with complex or stylized prompts. In this paper, we propose a parallel rescaling technique for personalized diffusion models. Our approach explicitly decomposes the consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to classifier free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, we minimize disruptive interference with CFG while preserving the subject's identity. Unlike prior personalization methods, our technique does not require additional training data or expensive annotations. Extensive experiments show improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity compared to baseline methods, even on challenging stylized prompts. These findings highlight the potential of parallel rescaled guidance to yield more stable and accurate personalization for diverse user inputs.

Abstract: Robotics has broad applications from automating house chores to taking care of patients. However, evaluating robot control policies is challenging, as real-world testing is expensive, while handcrafted simulations often fail to accurately reflect real-world conditions, resulting in poor correlation between simulated evaluation and real-world outcomes. In this work, we investigate World-model-based Policy Evaluation (WPE). We first train an action-conditioned video generation model as a proxy to real-world environments. To enable efficient rollouts of hundreds of interactive steps while mitigating error accumulation in the world model, we propose an inference scheme which we call Blockwise-Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer with adjustable context and decoding horizon lengths. To ensure that the world model indeed follows action input, we propose metrics based on the agreement between the ground truth video and generated video conditioned on the same sequence of actions to evaluate the world model. We then use the world model for policy evaluation by performing Monte Carlo rollouts in the world model while employing a vision-language model (VLM) as a reward function. Interestingly, we found that WPE tends to underestimate the policy values for in-distribution actions and overestimate policy values for out-of-distribution actions. Nevertheless, WPE preserves the relative rankings of different policies. In emulating real robot executions, WPE achieves high fidelity in mimicing robot arm movements as in real videos, while emulating highly realistic object interaction remains challenging. Despite this limitation, we show that a world model can serve as a starting point for evaluating robot policies before real-world deployment.

Abstract: Real-world multichannel time series prediction faces growing demands for efficiency across edge and cloud environments, making channel compression a timely and essential problem. Motivated by success of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) methods, we propose a predictability-aware compression-decompression framework to reduce runtime, lower communication cost, and maintain prediction accuracy across diverse predictors. The core idea involves using a circular periodicity key matrix with orthogonality to capture underlying time series predictability during compression and to mitigate reconstruction errors during decompression by relaxing oversimplified data assumptions. Theoretical and empirical analyses show that the proposed framework is both time-efficient and scalable under a large number of channels. Extensive experiments on six datasets across various predictors demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior overall performance by jointly considering prediction accuracy and runtime, while maintaining strong compatibility with diverse predictors.

Abstract: We introduce a concise, topologically-motivated semantics for finite dialogues by mapping each utterance to an open set in a fixed semantic space, building the corresponding nerve complex of joint satisfiability, and extracting fundamental combinatorial invariants:
  1. The negative nerve, which enumerates all finite collections of utterances whose
  opens have empty intersection, providing a straightforward criterion for merging
  separate transcripts without contradiction.
  2. The global interpretation subspace, the unique minimal open in which all asserted
  utterances hold simultaneously, enabling effective enumeration of all logical
  consequences of the entire dialogue.
  3. A practical demonstration in the Wolfram Language, with algorithms for constructing
  nerves, detecting inconsistencies, and computing the global interpretation, thereby
  illustrating computational feasibility.
  Our framework is grounded in classical duality and topological semantics (Stone duality, Priestley duality, Tarski's semantics, coherence-space methods, Scott domains, topos semantics, and homotopy type theory) while drawing on recent advances in topological data analysis and dialogue-based semantics.

Abstract: In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and (3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.

<title>The Disparate Effects of Partial Information in Bayesian Strategic Learning</title>

Abstract: We study how partial information about scoring rules affects fairness in strategic learning settings. In strategic learning, a learner deploys a scoring rule, and agents respond strategically by modifying their features -- at some cost -- to improve their outcomes. However, in our work, agents do not observe the scoring rule directly; instead, they receive a noisy signal of said rule. We consider two different agent models: (i) naive agents, who take the noisy signal at face value, and (ii) Bayesian agents, who update a prior belief based on the signal.
  Our goal is to understand how disparities in outcomes arise between groups that differ in their costs of feature modification, and how these disparities vary with the level of transparency of the learner's rule. For naive agents, we show that utility disparities can grow unboundedly with noise, and that the group with lower costs can, perhaps counter-intuitively, be disproportionately harmed under limited transparency. In contrast, for Bayesian agents, disparities remain bounded. We provide a full characterization of disparities across groups as a function of the level of transparency and show that they can vary non-monotonically with noise; in particular, disparities are often minimized at intermediate levels of transparency. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings where groups differ not only in cost, but also in prior beliefs, and study how this asymmetry influences fairness.

Abstract: Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image generation to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity, clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion, our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in many domains, such as transportation, meteorology, and energy. However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics. Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.

Abstract: Stuttering is a complex disorder that requires specialized expertise for effective assessment and treatment. This paper presents an effort to enhance the FluencyBank dataset with a new stuttering annotation scheme based on established clinical standards. To achieve high-quality annotations, we hired expert clinicians to label the data, ensuring that the resulting annotations mirror real-world clinical expertise. The annotations are multi-modal, incorporating audiovisual features for the detection and classification of stuttering moments, secondary behaviors, and tension scores. In addition to individual annotations, we additionally provide a test set with highly reliable annotations based on expert consensus for assessing individual annotators and machine learning models. Our experiments and analysis illustrate the complexity of this task that necessitates extensive clinical expertise for valid training and evaluation of stuttering assessment models.

<title>Linear Representation Transferability Hypothesis: Leveraging Small Models to Steer Large Models</title>

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models, regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding representation alignment across model scales.

<title>Permutation-Invariant Transformer Neural Architectures for Set-Based Indoor Localization Using Learned RSSI Embeddings</title>

Abstract: We propose a permutation-invariant neural architecture for indoor localization using RSSI scans from Wi-Fi access points. Each scan is modeled as an unordered set of (BSSID, RSSI) pairs, where BSSIDs are mapped to learned embeddings and concatenated with signal strength. These are processed by a Set Transformer, enabling the model to handle variable-length, sparse inputs while learning attention- based representations over access point relationships. We evaluate the model on a dataset collected across a campus environment consisting of six buildings. Results show that the model accurately recovers fine-grained spatial structure and maintains performance across physically distinct domains. In our experiments, a simple LSTM consistently outperformed all other models, achieving the lowest mean localization error across three tasks (E1 - E3), with average errors as low as 2.23 m. The Set Transformer performed competitively, ranking second in every experiment and outperforming the MLP, RNN, and basic attention models, particularly in scenarios involving multiple buildings (E2) and multiple floors (E3). Performance degraded most in E2, where signal conditions varied substantially across buildings, highlighting the importance of architectural robustness to domain diversity. This work demonstrates that set-based neural models are a natural fit for signal-based localization, offering a principled approach to handling sparse, unordered inputs in real-world positioning tasks.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating, brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting, outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than zero-shot prompting.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) is a key technique for protecting sensitive patient data in medical deep learning (DL). As clinical models grow more data-dependent, balancing privacy with utility and fairness has become a critical challenge. This scoping review synthesizes recent developments in applying DP to medical DL, with a particular focus on DP-SGD and alternative mechanisms across centralized and federated settings. Using a structured search strategy, we identified 74 studies published up to March 2025. Our analysis spans diverse data modalities, training setups, and downstream tasks, and highlights the tradeoffs between privacy guarantees, model accuracy, and subgroup fairness. We find that while DP-especially at strong privacy budgets-can preserve performance in well-structured imaging tasks, severe degradation often occurs under strict privacy, particularly in underrepresented or complex modalities. Furthermore, privacy-induced performance gaps disproportionately affect demographic subgroups, with fairness impacts varying by data type and task. A small subset of studies explicitly addresses these tradeoffs through subgroup analysis or fairness metrics, but most omit them entirely. Beyond DP-SGD, emerging approaches leverage alternative mechanisms, generative models, and hybrid federated designs, though reporting remains inconsistent. We conclude by outlining key gaps in fairness auditing, standardization, and evaluation protocols, offering guidance for future work toward equitable and clinically robust privacy-preserving DL systems in medicine.

<title>Thinking Out of the Box: Hybrid SAT Solving by Unconstrained Continuous Optimization</title>

Abstract: The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem lies at the core of many applications in combinatorial optimization, software verification, cryptography, and machine learning. While state-of-the-art solvers have demonstrated high efficiency in handling conjunctive normal form (CNF) formulas, numerous applications require non-CNF (hybrid) constraints, such as XOR, cardinality, and Not-All-Equal constraints. Recent work leverages polynomial representations to represent such hybrid constraints, but it relies on box constraints that can limit the use of powerful unconstrained optimizers. In this paper, we propose unconstrained continuous optimization formulations for hybrid SAT solving by penalty terms. We provide theoretical insights into when these penalty terms are necessary and demonstrate empirically that unconstrained optimizers (e.g., Adam) can enhance SAT solving on hybrid benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of combining continuous optimization and machine-learning-based methods for effective hybrid SAT solving.

<title>SafeTuneBed: A Toolkit for Benchmarking LLM Safety Alignment in Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become ubiquitous, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and safety-first defenses have proliferated rapidly. However, the number of approaches and their recent increase have resulted in diverse evaluations-varied datasets, metrics, and inconsistent threat settings-making it difficult to fairly compare safety, utility, and robustness across methods. To address this, we introduce SafeTuneBed, a benchmark and toolkit unifying fine-tuning and defense evaluation. SafeTuneBed (i) curates a diverse repository of multiple fine-tuning datasets spanning sentiment analysis, question-answering, multi-step reasoning, and open-ended instruction tasks, and allows for the generation of harmful-variant splits; (ii) enables integration of state-of-the-art defenses, including alignment-stage immunization, in-training safeguards, and post-tuning repair; and (iii) provides evaluators for safety (attack success rate, refusal consistency) and utility. Built on Python-first, dataclass-driven configs and plugins, SafeTuneBed requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning regime, defense method, and metric suite, while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We showcase its value by benchmarking representative defenses across varied poisoning scenarios and tasks. By standardizing data, code, and metrics, SafeTuneBed is the first focused toolkit of its kind to accelerate rigorous and comparable research in safe LLM fine-tuning. Code is available at: https://github.com/criticalml-uw/SafeTuneBed

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a key investigation in clinical cardiovascular medicine and has been used extensively in population research. However, extracting clinically important measurements such as ejection fraction for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases remains time-consuming and subjective. We developed CineMA, a foundation AI model automating these tasks with limited labels. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on 74,916 cine CMR studies to reconstruct images from masked inputs. After fine-tuning, it was evaluated across eight datasets on 23 tasks from four categories: ventricle and myocardium segmentation, left and right ventricle ejection fraction calculation, disease detection and classification, and landmark localisation. CineMA is the first foundation model for cine CMR to match or outperform convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CineMA demonstrated greater label efficiency than CNNs, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer annotations. This reduces the burden of clinician labelling and supports replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning foundation models in future cardiac imaging applications. Models and code for pre-training and fine-tuning are available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA, democratising access to high-performance models that otherwise require substantial computational resources, promoting reproducibility and accelerating clinical translation.

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work, we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing. Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines. Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

Abstract: Training reinforcement learning (RL) agents often requires significant computational resources and extended training times. To address this, we build upon the foundation laid by Google Brain's Sensory Neuron, which introduced a novel neural architecture for reinforcement learning tasks that maintained permutation in-variance in the sensory neuron system. While the baseline model demonstrated significant performance improvements over traditional approaches, we identified opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the learning process further. We propose a modified attention mechanism incorporating a non-linear transformation of the key vectors (K) using a mapping function, resulting in a new set of key vectors (K'). This non-linear mapping enhances the representational capacity of the attention mechanism, allowing the model to encode more complex feature interactions and accelerating convergence without compromising performance. Our enhanced model demonstrates significant improvements in learning efficiency, showcasing the potential for non-linear attention mechanisms in advancing reinforcement learning algorithms.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3) recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test 3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors, highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings.

Abstract: Determining whether a dataset was part of a machine learning model's training data pool can reveal privacy vulnerabilities, a challenge often addressed through membership inference attacks (MIAs). Traditional MIAs typically require access to model internals or rely on computationally intensive shadow models. This paper proposes an efficient, interpretable and principled Bayesian inference method for membership inference. By analyzing post-hoc metrics such as prediction error, confidence (entropy), perturbation magnitude, and dataset statistics from a trained ML model, our approach computes posterior probabilities of membership without requiring extensive model training. Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness in distinguishing member from non-member datasets. Beyond membership inference, this method can also detect distribution shifts, offering a practical and interpretable alternative to existing approaches.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data, yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization (DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty, mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions. Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains, we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes. Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features. We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference over arguments and the relations between them.

Abstract: Functional correctness is critical for ensuring the reliability and security of network protocol implementations. Functional bugs, instances where implementations diverge from behaviors specified in RFC documents, can lead to severe consequences, including faulty routing, authentication bypasses, and service disruptions. Detecting these bugs requires deep semantic analysis across specification documents and source code, a task beyond the capabilities of traditional static analysis tools. This paper introduces RFCScan, an autonomous agent that leverages large language models (LLMs) to detect functional bugs by checking conformance between network protocol implementations and their RFC specifications. Inspired by the human auditing procedure, RFCScan comprises two key components: an indexing agent and a detection agent. The former hierarchically summarizes protocol code semantics, generating semantic indexes that enable the detection agent to narrow down the scanning scope. The latter employs demand-driven retrieval to iteratively collect additional relevant data structures and functions, eventually identifying potential inconsistencies with the RFC specifications effectively. We evaluate RFCScan across six real-world network protocol implementations. RFCScan identifies 47 functional bugs with 81.9% precision, of which 20 bugs have been confirmed or fixed by developers.

Abstract: Human vision organizes local cues into coherent global forms using Gestalt principles like closure, proximity, and figure-ground assignment -- functions reliant on global spatial structure. We investigate whether modern vision models show similar behaviors, and under what training conditions these emerge. We find that Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained with Masked Autoencoding (MAE) exhibit activation patterns consistent with Gestalt laws, including illusory contour completion, convexity preference, and dynamic figure-ground segregation. To probe the computational basis, we hypothesize that modeling global dependencies is necessary for Gestalt-like organization. We introduce the Distorted Spatial Relationship Testbench (DiSRT), which evaluates sensitivity to global spatial perturbations while preserving local textures. Using DiSRT, we show that self-supervised models (e.g., MAE, CLIP) outperform supervised baselines and sometimes even exceed human performance. ConvNeXt models trained with MAE also exhibit Gestalt-compatible representations, suggesting such sensitivity can arise without attention architectures. However, classification finetuning degrades this ability. Inspired by biological vision, we show that a Top-K activation sparsity mechanism can restore global sensitivity. Our findings identify training conditions that promote or suppress Gestalt-like perception and establish DiSRT as a diagnostic for global structure sensitivity across models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to forecasting tasks, with some works claiming these systems match or exceed human performance. In this paper, we argue that, as a community, we should be careful about such conclusions as evaluating LLM forecasters presents unique challenges. We identify two broad categories of issues: (1) difficulty in trusting evaluation results due to many forms of temporal leakage, and (2) difficulty in extrapolating from evaluation performance to real-world forecasting. Through systematic analysis and concrete examples from prior work, we demonstrate how evaluation flaws can raise concerns about current and future performance claims. We argue that more rigorous evaluation methodologies are needed to confidently assess the forecasting abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) by incorporating physical laws into the training process. However, the performance of PINNs is often hindered in real-world scenarios involving noisy observational data and missing physics, particularly in inverse problems. In this work, we propose an iterative multi-objective PINN ensemble Kalman filter (MoPINNEnKF) framework that improves the robustness and accuracy of PINNs in both forward and inverse problems by using the \textit{ensemble Kalman filter} and the \textit{non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm} III (NSGA-III). Specifically, NSGA-III is used as a multi-objective optimizer that can generate various ensemble members of PINNs along the optimal Pareto front, while accounting the model uncertainty in the solution space. These ensemble members are then utilized within the EnKF to assimilate noisy observational data. The EnKF's analysis is subsequently used to refine the data loss component for retraining the PINNs, thereby iteratively updating their parameters. The iterative procedure generates improved solutions to the PDEs. The proposed method is tested on two benchmark problems: the one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation and the time-fractional mixed diffusion-wave equation (TFMDWE). The numerical results show it outperforms standard PINNs in handling noisy data and missing physics.

Our focus is on achieving this efficiently, tailored for real-time, on-device video dubbing scenarios. We developed a phoneme-based end-to-end length-sensitive speech translation (LSST) model, which generates translations of varying lengths short, normal, and long using predefined tags. Additionally, we introduced length-aware beam search (LABS), an efficient approach to generate translations of different lengths in a single decoding pass. This approach maintained comparable BLEU scores compared to a baseline without length awareness while significantly enhancing synchronization quality between source and target audio, achieving a mean opinion score (MOS) gain of 0.34 for Spanish and 0.65 for Korean, respectively.

Abstract: Designing 3D scenes is traditionally a challenging task that demands both artistic expertise and proficiency with complex software. Recent advances in text-to-3D generation have greatly simplified this process by letting users create scenes based on simple text descriptions. However, as these methods generally require extra training or in-context learning, their performance is often hindered by the limited availability of high-quality 3D data. In contrast, modern text-to-image models learned from web-scale images can generate scenes with diverse, reliable spatial layouts and consistent, visually appealing styles. Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D scenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D synthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated pipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form text-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary layouts.
  First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape and appearance of objects to create 3D models. These models are assembled into the final scene using geometry, position, and pose information derived from the same intermediary image. Being generalizable to a wide range of scenes and styles, ArtiScene outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in layout and aesthetic quality by quantitative metrics. It also averages a 74.89% winning rate in extensive user studies and 95.07% in GPT-4o evaluation. Project page: https://artiscene-cvpr.github.io/

<title>Assortment of Attention Heads: Accelerating Federated PEFT with Head Pruning and Strategic Client Selection</title>

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the de-facto approach in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks in Natural Language Processing. However, its adoption in privacy-preserving distributed learning frameworks, such as Federated Learning (FL), remains relatively limited. This is mainly due to challenges specific to FL, such as resource-constrained devices and diverse data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to perform PEFT within the FL framework for Multi-Head Attention (MHA) based language models. We address the challenges through head pruning, a novel head-specific weighted aggregation mechanism, and a client selection strategy. Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups, XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of 3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about code semantics is essential for enhancing code LLMs' abilities to solve real-world software engineering (SE) tasks. Although several code reasoning benchmarks exist, most rely on synthetic datasets or educational coding problems and focus on coarse-grained reasoning tasks such as input/output prediction, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating LLMs in practical SE contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose CodeSense, the first benchmark that makes available a spectrum of fine-grained code reasoning tasks concerned with the software engineering of real-world code. We collected Python, C and Java software projects from real-world repositories. We executed tests from these repositories, collected their execution traces, and constructed a ground truth dataset for fine-grained semantic reasoning tasks. We then performed comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show a clear performance gap for the models to handle fine-grained reasoning tasks. Although prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought and in-context learning helped, the lack of code semantics in LLMs fundamentally limit models' capabilities of code reasoning. Besides dataset, benchmark and evaluation, our work produced an execution tracing framework and tool set that make it easy to collect ground truth for fine-grained SE reasoning tasks, offering a strong basis for future benchmark construction and model post training. Our code and data are located at https://codesense-bench.github.io/.

<title>"Who experiences large model decay and why?" A Hierarchical Framework for Diagnosing Heterogeneous Performance Drift</title>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models frequently experience performance degradation when deployed in new contexts. Such degradation is rarely uniform: some subgroups may suffer large performance decay while others may not. Understanding where and how large differences in performance arise is critical for designing targeted corrective actions that mitigate decay for the most affected subgroups while minimizing any unintended effects. Current approaches do not provide such detailed insight, as they either (i) explain how average performance shifts arise or (ii) identify adversely affected subgroups without insight into how this occurred. To this end, we introduce a Subgroup-scanning Hierarchical Inference Framework for performance drifT (SHIFT). SHIFT first asks "Is there any subgroup with unacceptably large performance decay due to covariate/outcome shifts?" (Where?) and, if so, dives deeper to ask "Can we explain this using more detailed variable(subset)-specific shifts?" (How?). In real-world experiments, we find that SHIFT identifies interpretable subgroups affected by performance decay, and suggests targeted actions that effectively mitigate the decay.

<title>Beyond Attention: Learning Spatio-Temporal Dynamics with Emergent Interpretable Topologies</title>

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is critical in applications such as traffic prediction, energy demand modeling, and weather monitoring. While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) are popular for modeling spatial dependencies, they rely on predefined adjacency structures and dynamic attention scores, introducing inductive biases and computational overhead that can obscure interpretability.
  We propose InterGAT, a simplified alternative to GAT that replaces masked attention with a fully learnable, symmetric node interaction matrix, capturing latent spatial relationships without relying on fixed graph topologies. Our framework, InterGAT-GRU, which incorporates a GRU-based temporal decoder, outperforms the baseline GAT-GRU in forecasting accuracy, achieving at least a 21% improvement on the SZ-Taxi dataset and a 6% improvement on the Los-Loop dataset across all forecasting horizons (15 to 60 minutes). Additionally, we observed reduction in training time by 60-70% compared to GAT-GRU baseline.
  Crucially, the learned interaction matrix reveals interpretable structure: it recovers sparse, topology-aware attention patterns that align with community structure. Spectral and clustering analyses show that the model captures both localized and global dynamics, offering insights into the functional topology driving predictions. This highlights how structure learning can simultaneously support prediction, computational efficiency, and topological interpretabil-ity in dynamic graph-based domains.

Abstract: Medicinal chemists often optimize drugs considering their 3D structures and designing structurally distinct molecules that retain key features, such as shapes, pharmacophores, or chemical properties. Previous deep learning approaches address this through supervised tasks like molecule inpainting or property-guided optimization. In this work, we propose a flexible zero-shot molecule manipulation method by navigating in a shared latent space of 3D molecules. We introduce a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for 3D molecules, named MolFLAE, which learns a fixed-dimensional, SE(3)-equivariant latent space independent of atom counts. MolFLAE encodes 3D molecules using an SE(3)-equivariant neural network into fixed number of latent nodes, distinguished by learned embeddings. The latent space is regularized, and molecular structures are reconstructed via a Bayesian Flow Network (BFN) conditioned on the encoder's latent output. MolFLAE achieves competitive performance on standard unconditional 3D molecule generation benchmarks. Moreover, the latent space of MolFLAE enables zero-shot molecule manipulation, including atom number editing, structure reconstruction, and coordinated latent interpolation for both structure and properties. We further demonstrate our approach on a drug optimization task for the human glucocorticoid receptor, generating molecules with improved hydrophilicity while preserving key interactions, under computational evaluations. These results highlight the flexibility, robustness, and real-world utility of our method, opening new avenues for molecule editing and optimization.

<title>LIFT the Veil for the Truth: Principal Weights Emerge after Rank Reduction for Reasoning-Focused Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities. However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters, offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared to Full FT and LoRA.

<title>KG-TRACES: Enhancing Large Language Models with Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning and Attribution Supervision</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

Abstract: Automating the enrichment of UML class diagrams with behavioral methods from natural language use cases is a significant challenge. This study evaluates nine large language models (LLMs) in augmenting a methodless UML diagram (21 classes, 17 relationships) using 21 structured waste-management use cases. A total of 90 diagrams (3,373 methods) were assessed across six metrics: method quantity, signature richness (visibility, names, parameters, return types), annotation completeness (linking to use cases/actions), structural fidelity, syntactic correctness (PlantUML compilation), and naming convergence (across models). All LLMs produced valid PlantUML diagrams adhering to UML conventions. Some models excelled in method coverage and annotation accuracy, while others showed richer parameterization but weaker traceability. These results demonstrate that LLMs can generate well-structured methods with consistent naming, advancing automated behavioral modeling. However, inconsistencies in annotations and signatures highlight the need for improved prompt engineering and model selection. The rapid generation of these methods supports Agile practices by enabling faster design iterations. Despite their capabilities, human oversight is essential to ensure accuracy, appropriateness, and semantic alignment. This positions LLMs as collaborative partners in software design. All experimental artifacts (\texttt{.puml}, \texttt{.png}, \texttt{.csv}) are publicly available for reproducibility.

<title>Action Dependency Graphs for Globally Optimal Coordinated Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Action-dependent individual policies, which incorporate both environmental states and the actions of other agents in decision-making, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving global optimality in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, the existing literature often adopts auto-regressive action-dependent policies, where each agent's policy depends on the actions of all preceding agents. This formulation incurs substantial computational complexity as the number of agents increases, thereby limiting scalability. In this work, we consider a more generalized class of action-dependent policies, which do not necessarily follow the auto-regressive form. We propose to use the `action dependency graph (ADG)' to model the inter-agent action dependencies. Within the context of MARL problems structured by coordination graphs, we prove that an action-dependent policy with a sparse ADG can achieve global optimality, provided the ADG satisfies specific conditions specified by the coordination graph. Building on this theoretical foundation, we develop a tabular policy iteration algorithm with guaranteed global optimality. Furthermore, we integrate our framework into several SOTA algorithms and conduct experiments in complex environments. The empirical results affirm the robustness and applicability of our approach in more general scenarios, underscoring its potential for broader MARL challenges.

Abstract: Graph unlearning methods aim to efficiently remove the impact of sensitive data from trained GNNs without full retraining, assuming that deleted information cannot be recovered. In this work, we challenge this assumption by introducing the graph unlearning inversion attack: given only black-box access to an unlearned GNN and partial graph knowledge, can an adversary reconstruct the removed edges? We identify two key challenges: varying probability-similarity thresholds for unlearned versus retained edges, and the difficulty of locating unlearned edge endpoints, and address them with TrendAttack. First, we derive and exploit the confidence pitfall, a theoretical and empirical pattern showing that nodes adjacent to unlearned edges exhibit a large drop in model confidence. Second, we design an adaptive prediction mechanism that applies different similarity thresholds to unlearned and other membership edges. Our framework flexibly integrates existing membership inference techniques and extends them with trend features. Experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TrendAttack significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN membership inference baselines, exposing a critical privacy vulnerability in current graph unlearning methods.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL (MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance, which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance. Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms existing methods in MLCIL tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/scut-zx/L3A.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems map sensor data directly to control commands, but remain opaque, lack interpretability, and offer no formal safety guarantees. While recent vision-language-guided reinforcement learning (RL) methods introduce semantic feedback, they often rely on static prompts and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to dynamic driving scenes. We present DriveMind, a unified semantic reward framework that integrates: (i) a contrastive Vision-Language Model (VLM) encoder for stepwise semantic anchoring; (ii) a novelty-triggered VLM encoder-decoder, fine-tuned via chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation, for dynamic prompt generation upon semantic drift; (iii) a hierarchical safety module enforcing kinematic constraints (e.g., speed, lane centering, stability); and (iv) a compact predictive world model to reward alignment with anticipated ideal states. DriveMind achieves 19.4 +/- 2.3 km/h average speed, 0.98 +/- 0.03 route completion, and near-zero collisions in CARLA Town 2, outperforming baselines by over 4% in success rate. Its semantic reward generalizes zero-shot to real dash-cam data with minimal distributional shift, demonstrating robust cross-domain alignment and potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs), such as Evolutionary Scale Modeling (ESM), have demonstrated significant success in variant effect prediction. However, their adversarial robustness remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose SafeGenes: a framework for Secure analysis of genomic foundation models, leveraging adversarial attacks to evaluate robustness against both engineered near-identical adversarial Genes and embedding-space manipulations. In this study, we assess the adversarial vulnerabilities of GFMs using two approaches: the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and a soft prompt attack. FGSM introduces minimal perturbations to input sequences, while the soft prompt attack optimizes continuous embeddings to manipulate model predictions without modifying the input tokens. By combining these techniques, SafeGenes provides a comprehensive assessment of GFM susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Targeted soft prompt attacks led to substantial performance degradation, even in large models such as ESM1b and ESM1v. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in current foundation models, opening new research directions toward improving their security and robustness in high-stakes genomic applications such as variant effect prediction.

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs) by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion. Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios, particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at https://github.com/kzjkzj666/CompKE.

Abstract: Modern transportation systems rely on cyber-physical systems (CPS), where cyber systems interact seamlessly with physical systems like transportation-related sensors and actuators to enhance safety, mobility, and energy efficiency. However, growing automation and connectivity increase exposure to cyber vulnerabilities. Existing threat modeling frameworks for transportation CPS are often limited in scope, resource-intensive, and dependent on significant cybersecurity expertise. To address these gaps, we present TraCR-TMF (Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency Threat Modeling Framework), a large language model (LLM)-based framework that minimizes expert intervention. TraCR-TMF identifies threats, potential attack techniques, and corresponding countermeasures by leveraging the MITRE ATT&amp;CK matrix through three LLM-based approaches: (i) a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method requiring no expert input, (ii) an in-context learning approach requiring low expert input, and (iii) a supervised fine-tuning method requiring moderate expert input. TraCR-TMF also maps attack paths to critical assets by analyzing vulnerabilities using a customized LLM. The framework was evaluated in two scenarios. First, it identified relevant attack techniques across transportation CPS applications, with 90% precision as validated by experts. Second, using a fine-tuned LLM, it successfully predicted multiple exploitations including lateral movement, data exfiltration, and ransomware-related encryption that occurred during a major real-world cyberattack incident. These results demonstrate TraCR-TMF's effectiveness in CPS threat modeling, its reduced reliance on cybersecurity expertise, and its adaptability across CPS domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Speech (TTS) have significantly improved speech naturalness, increasing the demand for precise prosody control and mispronunciation correction. Existing approaches for prosody manipulation often depend on specialized modules or additional training, limiting their capacity for post-hoc adjustments. Similarly, traditional mispronunciation correction relies on grapheme-to-phoneme dictionaries, making it less practical in low-resource settings. We introduce Counterfactual Activation Editing, a model-agnostic method that manipulates internal representations in a pre-trained TTS model to achieve post-hoc control of prosody and pronunciation. Experimental results show that our method effectively adjusts prosodic features and corrects mispronunciations while preserving synthesis quality. This opens the door to inference-time refinement of TTS outputs without retraining, bridging the gap between pre-trained TTS models and editable speech synthesis.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to 17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward structured knowledge expertise.

Abstract: We introduce machine unlearning for speech tasks, a novel and underexplored research problem that aims to efficiently and effectively remove the influence of specific data from trained speech models without full retraining. This has important applications in privacy preservation, removal of outdated or noisy data, and bias mitigation. While machine unlearning has been studied in computer vision and natural language processing, its application to speech is largely unexplored due to the high-dimensional, sequential, and speaker-dependent nature of speech data. We define two fundamental speech unlearning tasks: sample unlearning, which removes individual data points (e.g., a voice recording), and class unlearning, which removes an entire category (e.g., all data from a speaker), while preserving performance on the remaining data. Experiments on keyword spotting and speaker identification demonstrate that unlearning speech data is significantly more challenging than unlearning image or text data. We conclude with key future directions in this area, including structured training, robust evaluation, feature-level unlearning, broader applications, scalable methods, and adversarial robustness.

<title>Generalization in VAE and Diffusion Models: A Unified Information-Theoretic Analysis</title>

Abstract: Despite the empirical success of Diffusion Models (DMs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their generalization performance remains theoretically underexplored, especially lacking a full consideration of the shared encoder-generator structure. Leveraging recent information-theoretic tools, we propose a unified theoretical framework that provides guarantees for the generalization of both the encoder and generator by treating them as randomized mappings. This framework further enables (1) a refined analysis for VAEs, accounting for the generator's generalization, which was previously overlooked; (2) illustrating an explicit trade-off in generalization terms for DMs that depends on the diffusion time $T$; and (3) providing computable bounds for DMs based solely on the training data, allowing the selection of the optimal $T$ and the integration of such bounds into the optimization process to improve model performance. Empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets illustrate the validity of the proposed theory.

<title>EEG2TEXT-CN: An Exploratory Study of Open-Vocabulary Chinese Text-EEG Alignment via Large Language Model and Contrastive Learning on ChineseEEG</title>

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences. Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%. While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

Abstract: Can AI effectively perform complex econometric analysis traditionally requiring human expertise? This paper evaluates an agentic AI's capability to master econometrics, focusing on empirical analysis performance. We develop an ``Econometrics AI Agent'' built on the open-source MetaGPT framework. This agent exhibits outstanding performance in: (1) planning econometric tasks strategically, (2) generating and executing code, (3) employing error-based reflection for improved robustness, and (4) allowing iterative refinement through multi-round conversations. We construct two datasets from academic coursework materials and published research papers to evaluate performance against real-world challenges. Comparative testing shows our domain-specialized agent significantly outperforms both benchmark large language models (LLMs) and general-purpose AI agents. This work establishes a testbed for exploring AI's impact on social science research and enables cost-effective integration of domain expertise, making advanced econometric methods accessible to users with minimal coding expertise. Furthermore, our agent enhances research reproducibility and offers promising pedagogical applications for econometrics teaching.

<title>Local Manifold Approximation and Projection for Manifold-Aware Diffusion Planning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative modeling have demonstrated significant promise in tackling long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks by leveraging offline datasets. While these approaches have achieved promising results, their reliability remains inconsistent due to the inherent stochastic risk of producing infeasible trajectories, limiting their applicability in safety-critical applications. We identify that the primary cause of these failures is inaccurate guidance during the sampling procedure, and demonstrate the existence of manifold deviation by deriving a lower bound on the guidance gap. To address this challenge, we propose Local Manifold Approximation and Projection (LoMAP), a training-free method that projects the guided sample onto a low-rank subspace approximated from offline datasets, preventing infeasible trajectory generation. We validate our approach on standard offline reinforcement learning benchmarks that involve challenging long-horizon planning. Furthermore, we show that, as a standalone module, LoMAP can be incorporated into the hierarchical diffusion planner, providing further performance enhancements.

Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks. The code will be released at https://fujiry0.github.io/TrajICL-project-page.

Abstract: Molecular Relational Learning (MRL) aims to understand interactions between molecular pairs, playing a critical role in advancing biochemical research. With the recent development of large language models (LLMs), a growing number of studies have explored the integration of MRL with LLMs and achieved promising results. However, the increasing availability of diverse LLMs and molecular structure encoders has significantly expanded the model space, presenting major challenges for benchmarking. Currently, there is no LLM framework that supports both flexible molecular input formats and dynamic architectural switching. To address these challenges, reduce redundant coding, and ensure fair model comparison, we propose ModuLM, a framework designed to support flexible LLM-based model construction and diverse molecular representations. ModuLM provides a rich suite of modular components, including 8 types of 2D molecular graph encoders, 11 types of 3D molecular conformation encoders, 7 types of interaction layers, and 7 mainstream LLM backbones. Owing to its highly flexible model assembly mechanism, ModuLM enables the dynamic construction of over 50,000 distinct model configurations. In addition, we provide comprehensive results to demonstrate the effectiveness of ModuLM in supporting LLM-based MRL tasks.

Abstract: Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency, model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment, and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably, CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech generation scenarios.

Abstract: Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement (CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

Abstract: Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions, remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs. Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models, such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware interactions. The dataset is available in https://github.com/JunyingWang959/A4Bench/.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across various software engineering tasks; however, their effectiveness in code migration, adapting code to run in different environments, remains insufficiently studied. In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1) identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments. Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1 rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions, which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended migration environment. The datasets are available at https://github.com/xdshen-ai/Benchmark-of-Code-Migration.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are emerging as powerful tools for long-horizon planning in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with offline datasets. However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality and diversity of training data. This often restricts their generalization to tasks outside their training distribution or longer planning horizons. To overcome this challenge, we propose State-Covering Trajectory Stitching (SCoTS), a novel reward-free trajectory augmentation method that incrementally stitches together short trajectory segments, systematically generating diverse and extended trajectories. SCoTS first learns a temporal distance-preserving latent representation that captures the underlying temporal structure of the environment, then iteratively stitches trajectory segments guided by directional exploration and novelty to effectively cover and expand this latent space. We demonstrate that SCoTS significantly improves the performance and generalization capabilities of diffusion planners on offline goal-conditioned benchmarks requiring stitching and long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, augmented trajectories generated by SCoTS significantly improve the performance of widely used offline goal-conditioned RL algorithms across diverse environments.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used framework for training compact, task-specific models by leveraging the knowledge of teacher models. However, its application to active learning (AL), which aims to minimize annotation costs through iterative sample selection, remains underexplored. This gap stems from the fact that KD typically assumes access to sufficient labeled data, whereas AL operates in data-scarce scenarios where task-specific teacher models are often unavailable. In this paper, we introduce ActiveKD, a framework that integrates AL with KD by leveraging the zero- and few-shot capabilities of large vision-language models (VLMs). A key aspect of ActiveKD is the structured prediction bias of VLMs--i.e., their predictions form clusters in the probability space. We regard this structure as an inductive bias of the teacher model, capturing generalizable output patterns beneficial to student learning. To exploit this bias, we propose Probabilistic CoreSet (PCoreSet), a selection strategy that maximizes coverage in the probability space rather than the feature space. PCoreSet strategically selects categorically diverse unlabeled samples, facilitating more efficient transfer of teacher knowledge under limited annotation budgets. Evaluations on 11 datasets show that PCoreSet consistently outperforms existing selection methods within the ActiveKD framework, advancing research at the intersection of AL and KD.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular, Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program following the guidance of each Python program.The final SQL program matches the reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing baseline.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

Abstract: Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional. In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality. Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of compositionality.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is critical in safety-sensitive applications but is often omitted from off-the-shelf neural networks due to adverse effects on predictive performance. Retrofitting uncertainty estimates post-hoc typically requires access to model parameters or gradients, limiting feasibility in practice. We propose a theoretically grounded framework for post-hoc uncertainty estimation in regression tasks by fitting an auxiliary model to both original inputs and frozen model outputs. Drawing from principles of maximum likelihood estimation and sequential parameter fitting, we formalize an exact post-hoc optimization objective that recovers the canonical MLE of Gaussian parameters, without requiring sampling or approximation at inference. While prior work has used model outputs to estimate uncertainty, we explicitly characterize the conditions under which this is valid and demonstrate the extent to which structured outputs can support quasi-epistemic inference. We find that using diverse auxiliary data, such as augmented subsets of the original training data, significantly enhances OOD detection and metric performance. Our hypothesis that frozen model outputs contain generalizable latent information about model error and predictive uncertainty is tested and confirmed. Finally, we ensure that our method maintains proper estimation of input-dependent uncertainty without relying exclusively on base model forecasts. These findings are demonstrated in toy problems and adapted to both UCI and depth regression benchmarks. Code: https://github.com/biggzlar/IO-CUE.

Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition, multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Abstract: This paper introduces a dual-layer framework for network operator-side quality of experience (QoE) assessment that integrates both objective network modeling and subjective user perception extracted from live-streaming platforms. On the objective side, we develop a machine learning model trained on mean opinion scores (MOS) computed via the ITU-T P.1203 reference implementation, allowing accurate prediction of user-perceived video quality using only network parameters such as packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput without reliance on video content or client-side instrumentation. On the subjective side, we present a semantic filtering and scoring pipeline that processes user comments from live streams to extract performance-related feedback. A large language model is used to assign scalar MOS scores to filtered comments in a deterministic and reproducible manner. To support scalable and interpretable analysis, we con- struct a labeled dataset of 47,894 live-stream comments, of which about 34,000 are identified as QoE-relevant through multi-layer semantic filtering. Each comment is enriched with simulated Internet Service Provider attribution and temporally aligned using synthetic timestamps in 5-min intervals. The resulting dataset enables operator-level aggregation and time-series analysis of user-perceived quality. A delta MOS metric is proposed to measure each Internet service provider's deviation from platform-wide sentiment, allowing detection of localized degradations even in the absence of direct network telemetry. A controlled outage simulation confirms the framework's effectiveness in identifying service disruptions through comment-based trends alone. The system provides each operator with its own subjective MOS and the global platform average per interval, enabling real-time interpretation of performance deviations and comparison with objective network-based QoE estimates.

Abstract: To enhance immersive experiences, binaural audio offers spatial awareness of sounding objects in AR, VR, and embodied AI applications. While existing audio spatialization methods can generally map any available monaural audio to binaural audio signals, they often lack the flexible and interactive control needed in complex multi-object user-interactive environments. To address this, we propose a Text-guided Audio Spatialization (TAS) framework that utilizes flexible text prompts and evaluates our model from unified generation and comprehension perspectives. Due to the limited availability of premium and large-scale stereo data, we construct the SpatialTAS dataset, which encompasses 376,000 simulated binaural audio samples to facilitate the training of our model. Our model learns binaural differences guided by 3D spatial location and relative position prompts, augmented by flipped-channel audio. It outperforms existing methods on both simulated and real-recorded datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and accuracy. Besides, we develop an assessment model based on Llama-3.1-8B, which evaluates the spatial semantic coherence between our generated binaural audio and text prompts through a spatial reasoning task. Results demonstrate that text prompts provide flexible and interactive control to generate binaural audio with excellent quality and semantic consistency in spatial locations.

Abstract: While audio foundation models perform well on myriad of tasks from sound classification to speech analysis, these models are trained and tested on dry, non-spatial, single-source audio clips. This limits their success in real-world situations and results in spatially unaware audio embeddings. To address these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised training approach for General-Purpose, Real-world Audio Models (GRAMs). The GRAM training approach enables robust spatial audio representation learning for naturalistic, noisy sound scenes and can be applied to any masking-based deep learning model. We demonstrate the success of our approach by training two state-of-the-art models, one with a transformer and one with a mamba backbone. We assess the quality of the extracted audio representations from GRAMs using the original version of the HEAR benchmark, a newly synthesized, naturalistic version of the HEAR benchmark, and novel sound localization tasks based on HEAR benchmark datasets. The results show that our approach minimizes the performance gap between dry, non-spatial, single-source sound scenes and naturalistic sound scenes for crucial tasks such as auditory scene analysis, outperforming existing state-of-the-art audio foundation models at a fraction of the training steps. Moreover, GRAMs show state-of-the-art performance on sound localization tasks, exceeding even supervised sound localization models. In sum, the proposed approach represents a significant advancement towards robust audio foundation models for real-world applications with state-of-the-art performance on naturalistic sound scenes as well as spatial audio representation learning.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of molecular metabolic stability (MS) is critical for drug research and development but remains challenging due to the complex interplay of molecular interactions. Despite recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) for MS prediction, current approaches face two critical limitations: (1) incomplete molecular modeling due to atom-centric message-passing mechanisms that disregard bond-level topological features, and (2) prediction frameworks that lack reliable uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose TrustworthyMS, a novel contrastive learning framework designed for uncertainty-aware metabolic stability prediction. First, a molecular graph topology remapping mechanism synchronizes atom-bond interactions through edge-induced feature propagation, capturing both localized electronic effects and global conformational constraints. Second, contrastive topology-bond alignment enforces consistency between molecular topology views and bond patterns via feature alignment, enhancing representation robustness. Third, uncertainty modeling through Beta-Binomial uncertainty quantification enables simultaneous prediction and confidence calibration under epistemic uncertainty. Through extensive experiments, our results demonstrate that TrustworthyMS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance.

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However, existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks, including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple ECGs.

Abstract: Smart contracts can implement and automate parts of legal contracts, but ensuring their legal compliance remains challenging. Existing approaches such as formal specification, verification, and model-based development require expertise in both legal and software development domains, as well as extensive manual effort. Given the recent advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation, we investigate their ability to generate legally compliant smart contracts directly from natural language legal contracts, addressing these challenges. We propose a novel suite of metrics to quantify legal compliance based on modeling both legal and smart contracts as processes and comparing their behaviors. We select four LLMs, generate 20 smart contracts based on five legal contracts, and analyze their legal compliance. We find that while all LLMs generate syntactically correct code, there is significant variance in their legal compliance with larger models generally showing higher levels of compliance. We also evaluate the proposed metrics against properties of software metrics, showing they provide fine-grained distinctions, enable nuanced comparisons, and are applicable across domains for code from any source, LLM or developer. Our results suggest that LLMs can assist in generating starter code for legally compliant smart contracts with strict reviews, and the proposed metrics provide a foundation for automated and self-improving development workflows.

Abstract: Data heterogeneity plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of machine learning (ML) systems. Traditional algorithms, which are typically designed to optimize average performance, often overlook the intrinsic diversity within datasets. This oversight can lead to a myriad of issues, including unreliable decision-making, inadequate generalization across different domains, unfair outcomes, and false scientific inferences. Hence, a nuanced approach to modeling data heterogeneity is essential for the development of dependable, data-driven systems. In this survey paper, we present a thorough exploration of heterogeneity-aware machine learning, a paradigm that systematically integrates considerations of data heterogeneity throughout the entire ML pipeline -- from data collection and model training to model evaluation and deployment. By applying this approach to a variety of critical fields, including healthcare, agriculture, finance, and recommendation systems, we demonstrate the substantial benefits and potential of heterogeneity-aware ML. These applications underscore how a deeper understanding of data diversity can enhance model robustness, fairness, and reliability and help model diagnosis and improvements. Moreover, we delve into future directions and provide research opportunities for the whole data mining community, aiming to promote the development of heterogeneity-aware ML.

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical efficiency for real-time applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in visual domains has resulted in highly realistic synthetic images and videos, driven by sophisticated generative frameworks such as diffusion-based architectures. While these breakthroughs open substantial opportunities, they simultaneously raise critical concerns about content authenticity and integrity. Many current AIGC detection methods operate as black-box binary classifiers, which offer limited interpretability, and no approach supports detecting both images and videos in a unified framework. This dual limitation compromises model transparency, reduces trustworthiness, and hinders practical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce IVY-FAKE , a novel, unified, and large-scale dataset specifically designed for explainable multimodal AIGC detection. Unlike prior benchmarks, which suffer from fragmented modality coverage and sparse annotations, IVY-FAKE contains over 150,000 richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 18,700 evaluation examples, each accompanied by detailed natural-language reasoning beyond simple binary labels. Building on this, we propose Ivy Explainable Detector (IVY-XDETECTOR), a unified AIGC detection and explainable architecture that jointly performs explainable detection for both image and video content. Our unified vision-language model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple image and video detection benchmarks, highlighting the significant advancements enabled by our dataset and modeling framework. Our data is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AI-Safeguard/Ivy-Fake.

Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings. However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics. Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

<title>Bridging the Gap: From Ad-hoc to Proactive Search in Conversations</title>

Abstract: Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers' performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.

Abstract: The emergence of ResNet provides a powerful tool for training extremely deep networks. The core idea behind it is to change the learning goals of the network. It no longer learns new features from scratch but learns the difference between the target and existing features. However, the difference between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still having the advantages of ResNet. Specifically, it chooses to learn the quotient of the target features with the existing features, so we call it the quotient network. In order to enable this network to learn successfully and achieve higher performance, we propose some design rules for this network so that it can be trained efficiently and achieve better performance than ResNet. Experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets prove that this network can stably achieve considerable improvements over ResNet by simply making tiny corresponding changes to the original ResNet network without adding new parameters.

Abstract: We introduce MoCA-Video (Motion-Aware Concept Alignment in Video), a training-free framework bridging the gap between image-domain semantic mixing and video. Given a generated video and a user-provided reference image, MoCA-Video injects the semantic features of the reference image into a specific object within the video, while preserving the original motion and visual context. Our approach leverages a diagonal denoising schedule and class-agnostic segmentation to detect and track objects in the latent space and precisely control the spatial location of the blended objects. To ensure temporal coherence, we incorporate momentum-based semantic corrections and gamma residual noise stabilization for smooth frame transitions. We evaluate MoCA's performance using the standard SSIM, image-level LPIPS, temporal LPIPS, and introduce a novel metric CASS (Conceptual Alignment Shift Score) to evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of the visual shifts between the source prompt and the modified video frames. Using self-constructed dataset, MoCA-Video outperforms current baselines, achieving superior spatial consistency, coherent motion, and a significantly higher CASS score, despite having no training or fine-tuning. MoCA-Video demonstrates that structured manipulation in the diffusion noise trajectory allows for controllable, high-quality video synthesis.

Abstract: This paper proposes a model that integrates sub-band processing and deep filtering to fully exploit information from the target time-frequency (TF) bin and its surrounding TF bins for single-channel speech enhancement. The sub-band module captures surrounding frequency bin information at the input, while the deep filtering module applies filtering at the output to both the target TF bin and its surrounding TF bins. To further improve the model performance, we decouple deep filtering into temporal and frequency components and introduce a two-stage framework, reducing the complexity of filter coefficient prediction at each stage. Additionally, we propose the TAConv module to strengthen convolutional feature extraction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical deep filtering network (HDF-Net) effectively utilizes surrounding TF bin information and outperforms other advanced systems while using fewer resources.

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically, the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task, overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

Abstract: Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures, parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language generation abilities. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are released at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/llm-graph-probing.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) poses challenges due to their massive scale and heterogeneous architectures. While adaptive optimizers like AdamW help address gradient variations, they still struggle with efficient and effective parameter-wise learning rate estimation, resulting in training instability, slow convergence, and poor compatibility with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques. This work introduces Scaling with Gradient Grouping (SGG), an optimizer wrapper that improves adaptive learning rate estimation by dynamic grouping and group-specific scaling. SGG first groups gradient statistics in each layer into clusters and then applies cluster-specific scaling to calibrate learning rates for each parameter, thus imposing collective group-wise constraints while maintaining precise per-parameter adaptation. Experiments on diverse (M)LLM benchmarks show that SGG integrates seamlessly with existing optimizers, and offers consistent gains and faster convergence over baselines, with various model sizes. Its stability across varying batch sizes and learning rates establishes SGG as a robust choice for LLM optimization.

Abstract: Feature attribution (FA) methods are widely used in explainable AI (XAI) to help users understand how the inputs of a machine learning model contribute to its outputs. However, different FA models often provide disagreeing importance scores for the same model. In the absence of ground truth or in-depth knowledge about the inner workings of the model, it is often difficult to meaningfully determine which of the different FA methods produce more suitable explanations in different contexts. As a step towards addressing this issue, we introduce the open-source XAI-Units benchmark, specifically designed to evaluate FA methods against diverse types of model behaviours, such as feature interactions, cancellations, and discontinuous outputs. Our benchmark provides a set of paired datasets and models with known internal mechanisms, establishing clear expectations for desirable attribution scores. Accompanied by a suite of built-in evaluation metrics, XAI-Units streamlines systematic experimentation and reveals how FA methods perform against distinct, atomic kinds of model reasoning, similar to unit tests in software engineering. Crucially, by using procedurally generated models tied to synthetic datasets, we pave the way towards an objective and reliable comparison of FA methods.

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors: (1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3) LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors. On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally, while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks, which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive "fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects. Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests, including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples, and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification, highlighting the importance of resilient analytical methods for personal identification.

<title>GThinker: Towards General Multimodal Reasoning via Cue-Guided Rethinking</title>

Abstract: Despite notable advancements in multimodal reasoning, leading Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still underperform on vision-centric multimodal reasoning tasks in general scenarios. This shortfall stems from their predominant reliance on logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies, while effective for domains like math and science, fail to integrate visual information effectively during reasoning. Consequently, these models often fail to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance in tasks that require multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences. To address this, we present GThinker (General Thinker), a novel reasoning MLLM excelling in multimodal reasoning across general scenarios, mathematics, and science. GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a flexible reasoning pattern that grounds inferences in visual cues and iteratively reinterprets these cues to resolve inconsistencies. Building on this pattern, we further propose a two-stage training pipeline, including pattern-guided cold start and incentive reinforcement learning, designed to enable multimodal reasoning capabilities across domains. Furthermore, to support the training, we construct GThinker-11K, comprising 7K high-quality, iteratively-annotated reasoning paths and 4K curated reinforcement learning samples, filling the data gap toward general multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GThinker achieves 81.5% on the challenging comprehensive multimodal reasoning benchmark M$^3$CoT, surpassing the latest O4-mini model. It also shows an average improvement of 2.1% on general scenario multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining on-par performance in mathematical reasoning compared to counterpart advanced reasoning models. The code, model, and data will be released soon at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/GThinker.

<title>Unfolding Boxes with Local Constraints</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of finding and enumerating polyominos that can be folded into multiple non-isomorphic boxes. While several computational approaches have been proposed, including SAT, randomized algorithms, and decision diagrams, none has been able to perform at scale. We argue that existing SAT encodings are hindered by the presence of global constraints (e.g., graph connectivity or acyclicity), which are generally hard to encode effectively and hard for solvers to reason about. In this work, we propose a new SAT-based approach that replaces these global constraints with simple local constraints that have substantially better propagation properties. Our approach dramatically improves the scalability of both computing and enumerating common box unfoldings: (i) while previous approaches could only find common unfoldings of two boxes up to area 88, ours easily scales beyond 150, and (ii) while previous approaches were only able to enumerate common unfoldings up to area 30, ours scales up to 60. This allows us to rule out 46, 54, and 58 as the smallest areas allowing a common unfolding of three boxes, thereby refuting a conjecture of Xu et al. (2017).

Abstract: Instruction tuning has been central to the success of recent vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains expensive-requiring large-scale datasets, high-quality annotations, and large compute budgets. We propose PRioritized cOncept learninG via Relative Error-driven Sample Selection (PROGRESS), a data- and compute-efficient framework that enables VLMs to dynamically select what to learn next based on their evolving needs during training. At each stage, the model tracks its learning progress across skills and selects the most informative samples-those it has not already mastered and that are not too difficult to learn at the current stage of training. This strategy effectively controls skill acquisition and the order in which skills are learned. Specifically, we sample from skills showing the highest learning progress, prioritizing those with the most rapid improvement. Unlike prior methods, PROGRESS requires no upfront answer annotations, queries answers only on a need basis, avoids reliance on additional supervision from auxiliary VLMs, and does not require compute-heavy gradient computations for data selection. Experiments across multiple instruction-tuning datasets of varying scales demonstrate that PROGRESS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less data and supervision. Additionally, we show strong cross-architecture generalization and transferability to larger models, validating PROGRESS as a scalable solution for efficient learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with 1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g. quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they reduce performance with others. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/metehanoguzz/LLMs-Indexicals-English.

<title>Speeding Up Hyper-Heuristics With Markov-Chain Operator Selection and the Only-Worsening Acceptance Operator</title>

Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i) Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter $m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a, counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature. However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3 \log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.

<title>CountingFruit: Real-Time 3D Fruit Counting with Language-Guided Semantic Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01109</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Accurate fruit counting in real-world agricultural environments is a longstanding challenge due to visual occlusions, semantic ambiguity, and the high computational demands of 3D reconstruction. Existing methods based on neural radiance fields suffer from low inference speed, limited generalization, and lack support for open-set semantic control. This paper presents FruitLangGS, a real-time 3D fruit counting framework that addresses these limitations through spatial reconstruction, semantic embedding, and language-guided instance estimation. FruitLangGS first reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive Gaussian splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization for efficient rendering. To enable semantic control, each Gaussian encodes a compressed CLIP-aligned language embedding, forming a compact and queryable 3D representation. At inference time, prompt-based semantic filtering is applied directly in 3D space, without relying on image-space segmentation or view-level fusion. The selected Gaussians are then converted into dense point clouds via distribution-aware sampling and clustered to estimate fruit counts. Experimental results on real orchard data demonstrate that FruitLangGS achieves higher rendering speed, semantic flexibility, and counting accuracy compared to prior approaches, offering a new perspective for language-driven, real-time neural rendering across open-world scenarios.

Abstract: High-quality, large-scale audio captioning is crucial for advancing audio understanding, yet current automated methods often generate captions that lack fine-grained detail and contextual accuracy, primarily due to their reliance on limited unimodal or superficial multimodal information. Drawing inspiration from human auditory perception, which adeptly integrates cross-modal cues and performs sophisticated auditory scene analysis, we introduce a novel two-stage automated pipeline. This pipeline first employs specialized pretrained models to extract diverse contextual cues (e.g., speech, music, general sounds, and visual information from associated video). A large language model (LLM) then synthesizes these rich, multimodal inputs to generate detailed and context-aware audio captions. Key contributions of this work include: (1) the proposed scalable method for fine-grained audio caption generation; (2) FusionAudio, a new large-scale dataset comprising 1.2 million such detailed captions, combined with 6 million QA pairs; and (3) enhanced audio models developed using FusionAudio, specifically a CLAP-based audio encoder with superior audio-text alignment and instruction following. This paper paves the way for more nuanced and accurate automated understanding of complex audio environments. Code and data can be found in https://github.com/satsuki2486441738/FusionAudio.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) Uncertainty Estimation (UE) methods have become a crucial tool for detecting hallucinations in recent years. While numerous UE methods have been proposed, most existing studies evaluate them in isolated short-form QA settings using threshold-independent metrics such as AUROC or PRR. However, real-world deployment of UE methods introduces several challenges. In this work, we systematically examine four key aspects of deploying UE methods in practical settings. Specifically, we assess (1) the sensitivity of UE methods to decision threshold selection, (2) their robustness to query transformations such as typos, adversarial prompts, and prior chat history, (3) their applicability to long-form generation, and (4) strategies for handling multiple UE scores for a single query. Our evaluations on 19 UE methods reveal that most of them are highly sensitive to threshold selection when there is a distribution shift in the calibration dataset. While these methods generally exhibit robustness against previous chat history and typos, they are significantly vulnerable to adversarial prompts. Additionally, while existing UE methods can be adapted for long-form generation through various strategies, there remains considerable room for improvement. Lastly, ensembling multiple UE scores at test time provides a notable performance boost, which highlights its potential as a practical improvement strategy. Code is available at: https://github.com/duygunuryldz/uncertainty_in_the_wild.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable generative capabilities of diffusion models, their integration into safety-critical or scientifically rigorous applications remains hindered by the need to ensure compliance with stringent physical, structural, and operational constraints. To address this challenge, this paper introduces Neuro-Symbolic Diffusion (NSD), a novel framework that interleaves diffusion steps with symbolic optimization, enabling the generation of certifiably consistent samples under user-defined functional and logic constraints. This key feature is provided for both standard and discrete diffusion models, enabling, for the first time, the generation of both continuous (e.g., images and trajectories) and discrete (e.g., molecular structures and natural language) outputs that comply with constraints. This ability is demonstrated on tasks spanning three key challenges: (1) Safety, in the context of non-toxic molecular generation and collision-free trajectory optimization; (2) Data scarcity, in domains such as drug discovery and materials engineering; and (3) Out-of-domain generalization, where enforcing symbolic constraints allows adaptation beyond the training distribution.

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has demonstrated that systems trained solely on text can acquire extensive world knowledge, develop reasoning capabilities, and internalize abstract semantic concepts--showcasing properties that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities: Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities. For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the community.

<title>Earley-Driven Dynamic Pruning for Efficient Structured Decoding</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language (DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel $\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time, significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly, Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.

Abstract: Simulation-free training frameworks have been at the forefront of the generative modelling revolution in continuous spaces, leading to neural dynamical systems that encompass modern large-scale diffusion and flow matching models. Despite the scalability of training, the generation of high-quality samples and their corresponding likelihood under the model requires expensive numerical simulation -- inhibiting adoption in numerous scientific applications such as equilibrium sampling of molecular systems. In this paper, we revisit classical normalizing flows as one-step generative models with exact likelihoods and propose a novel, scalable training objective that does not require computing the expensive change of variable formula used in conventional maximum likelihood training. We propose Forward-Only Regression Training (FORT), a simple $\ell_2$-regression objective that maps prior samples under our flow to specifically chosen targets. We demonstrate that FORT supports a wide class of targets, such as optimal transport targets and targets from pre-trained continuous-time normalizing flows (CNF). We further demonstrate that by using CNF targets, our one-step flows allow for larger-scale training that exceeds the performance and stability of maximum likelihood training, while unlocking a broader class of architectures that were previously challenging to train. Empirically, we elucidate that our trained flows can perform equilibrium conformation sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine dipeptide, alanine tripeptide, and alanine tetrapeptide.

Abstract: Leveraging high degrees of unstructured sparsity is a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of deep neural network DNN accelerators - particularly important for emerging Edge-AI applications. We introduce VUSA, a systolic-array architecture that virtually grows based on the present sparsity to perform larger matrix multiplications with the same number of physical multiply-accumulate MAC units. The proposed architecture achieves saving by 37% and 68% in area and power efficiency, respectively, at the same peak-performance, compared to a baseline systolic array architecture in a commercial 16-nm technology. Still, the proposed architecture supports acceleration for any DNN with any sparsity - even no sparsity at all. Thus, the proposed architecture is application-independent, making it viable for general-purpose AI acceleration.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical machine learning offers a path to leverage noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices for drug discovery, but optimal model architectures remain unclear. We systematically optimize the quantum-classical bridge architecture for generative adversarial networks (GANs) in molecular discovery using multi-objective Bayesian optimization. Our optimized model (BO-QGAN) significantly improves performance, achieving a 2.27-fold higher Drug Candidate Score (DCS) than prior quantum-hybrid benchmarks and 2.21-fold higher than the classical baseline, using over 60% fewer parameters. Key findings favor layering multiple (3-4) shallow (4-8 qubit) quantum circuits sequentially, while classical architecture shows less sensitivity above a minimum capacity. This work provides the first empirically grounded architectural guidelines for hybrid models, enabling more effective integration of current quantum computers into pharmaceutical research pipelines.

We train two types of generative models Masked Transformers and FlowMatching on 100 hours of humanoid demonstrations. Additionally we explore architectural variants with different attention mechanisms and parameter sharing strategies. Our parameter sharing techniques reduce model size by 33 to 53 with minimal impact on performance or visual fidelity. HWM is designed to be trained and deployed in practical academic and small lab settings such as 1 to 2 GPUs.

Abstract: This paper studies reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models with human preferences. While RLHF has demonstrated promising results, many algorithms are highly sensitive to misspecifications in the underlying preference model (e.g., the Bradley-Terry model), the reference policy, or the reward function, resulting in undesirable fine-tuning. To address model misspecification, we propose a doubly robust preference optimization algorithm that remains consistent when either the preference model or the reference policy is correctly specified (without requiring both). Our proposal demonstrates superior and more robust performance than state-of-the-art algorithms, both in theory and in practice. The code is available at https://github.com/DRPO4LLM/DRPO4LLM

Abstract: We introduce OG-VLA, a novel architecture and learning framework that combines the generalization strengths of Vision Language Action models (VLAs) with the robustness of 3D-aware policies. We address the challenge of mapping natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model (LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5 demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at https://og-vla.github.io/

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their cross-model adaptability.

Abstract: This review provides an in-depth exploration of the field of animal action recognition, focusing on coarse-grained (CG) and fine-grained (FG) techniques. The primary aim is to examine the current state of research in animal behaviour recognition and to elucidate the unique challenges associated with recognising subtle animal actions in outdoor environments. These challenges differ significantly from those encountered in human action recognition due to factors such as non-rigid body structures, frequent occlusions, and the lack of large-scale, annotated datasets. The review begins by discussing the evolution of human action recognition, a more established field, highlighting how it progressed from broad, coarse actions in controlled settings to the demand for fine-grained recognition in dynamic environments. This shift is particularly relevant for animal action recognition, where behavioural variability and environmental complexity present unique challenges that human-centric models cannot fully address. The review then underscores the critical differences between human and animal action recognition, with an emphasis on high intra-species variability, unstructured datasets, and the natural complexity of animal habitats. Techniques like spatio-temporal deep learning frameworks (e.g., SlowFast) are evaluated for their effectiveness in animal behaviour analysis, along with the limitations of existing datasets. By assessing the strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies and introducing a recently-published dataset, the review outlines future directions for advancing fine-grained action recognition, aiming to improve accuracy and generalisability in behaviour analysis across species.

Abstract: Graph-based frameworks are often used in network hardening to help a cyber defender understand how a network can be attacked and how the best defenses can be deployed. However, incorporating network connectivity parameters in the attack graph, reasoning about the attack graph when we do not have access to complete information, providing system administrator suggestions in an understandable format, and allowing them to do what-if analysis on various scenarios and attacker motives is still missing. We fill this gap by presenting SPEAR, a formal framework with tool support for security posture evaluation and analysis that keeps human-in-the-loop. SPEAR uses the causal formalism of AI planning to model vulnerabilities and configurations in a networked system. It automatically converts network configurations and vulnerability descriptions into planning models expressed in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). SPEAR identifies a set of diverse security hardening strategies that can be presented in a manner understandable to the domain expert. These allow the administrator to explore the network hardening solution space in a systematic fashion and help evaluate the impact and compare the different solutions.

<title>Towards Efficient Few-shot Graph Neural Architecture Search via Partitioning Gradient Contribution</title>

Abstract: To address the weight coupling problem, certain studies introduced few-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods, which partition the supernet into multiple sub-supernets. However, these methods often suffer from computational inefficiency and tend to provide suboptimal partitioning schemes. To address this problem more effectively, we analyze the weight coupling problem from a novel perspective, which primarily stems from distinct modules in succeeding layers imposing conflicting gradient directions on the preceding layer modules. Based on this perspective, we propose the Gradient Contribution (GC) method that efficiently computes the cosine similarity of gradient directions among modules by decomposing the Vector-Jacobian Product during supernet backpropagation. Subsequently, the modules with conflicting gradient directions are allocated to distinct sub-supernets while similar ones are grouped together. To assess the advantages of GC and address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Architecture Search methods, which are limited to searching a single type of Graph Neural Networks (Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) or Graph Transformers (GTs)), we propose the Unified Graph Neural Architecture Search (UGAS) framework, which explores optimal combinations of MPNNs and GTs. The experimental results demonstrate that GC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in supernet partitioning quality and time efficiency. In addition, the architectures searched by UGAS+GC outperform both the manually designed GNNs and those obtained by existing NAS methods. Finally, ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of all proposed methods.

Abstract: Transforming relational databases into knowledge graphs with enriched ontologies enhances semantic interoperability and unlocks advanced graph-based learning and reasoning over data. However, previous approaches either demand significant manual effort to derive an ontology from a database schema or produce only a basic ontology. We present RIGOR, Retrieval-augmented Iterative Generation of RDB Ontologies, an LLM-driven approach that turns relational schemas into rich OWL ontologies with minimal human effort. RIGOR combines three sources via RAG, the database schema and its documentation, a repository of domain ontologies, and a growing core ontology, to prompt a generative LLM for producing successive, provenance-tagged delta ontology fragments. Each fragment is refined by a judge-LLM before being merged into the core ontology, and the process iterates table-by-table following foreign key constraints until coverage is complete. Applied to real-world databases, our approach outputs ontologies that score highly on standard quality dimensions such as accuracy, completeness, conciseness, adaptability, clarity, and consistency, while substantially reducing manual effort.

Abstract: Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries, and environmental monitoring. However, their high dimensionality, large data volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite data. ImpliSat leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while preserving critical image details.

Abstract: We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar \underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories. The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs. With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence, paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding. Our code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/SungHo3268/KoGEM.

Abstract: Since the advent of AI, games have served as progress benchmarks. Meanwhile, imperfect-information variants of chess have existed for over a century, present extreme challenges, and have been the focus of significant AI research. Beyond calculation needed in regular chess, they require reasoning about information gathering, the opponent's knowledge, signaling, etc. The most popular variant, Fog of War (FoW) chess (aka. dark chess) is a recognized challenge problem in AI after superhuman performance was reached in no-limit Texas hold'em poker. We present Obscuro, the first superhuman AI for FoW chess. It introduces advances to search in imperfect-information games, enabling strong, scalable reasoning. Experiments against the prior state-of-the-art AI and human players -- including the world's best -- show that Obscuro is significantly stronger. FoW chess is the largest (by amount of imperfect information) turn-based game in which superhuman performance has been achieved and the largest game in which imperfect-information search has been successfully applied.

Abstract: Steering vision foundation models at inference time without retraining or access to large labeled datasets is a desirable yet challenging objective, particularly in dynamic or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data. Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44% on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2 and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost. Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100 with ViT-B/32.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning, diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism. To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning, prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts, providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models. Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and trustworthy medical AI systems. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are publicly available at: https://github.com/Wayyuanyuan/MTCMB.

<title>Detoxification of Large Language Models through Output-layer Fusion with a Calibration Model</title>

Abstract: Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data, designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding. Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled effective vision-language reasoning, yet the ability to understand video content remains constrained by suboptimal frame selection strategies. Existing approaches often rely on static heuristics or external retrieval modules to feed frame information into video-LLMs, which may fail to provide the query-relevant information. In this work, we introduce ReFoCUS (Reinforcement-guided Frame Optimization for Contextual UnderStanding), a novel frame-level policy optimization framework that shifts the optimization target from textual responses to visual input selection. ReFoCUS learns a frame selection policy via reinforcement learning, using reward signals derived from a reference LMM to reflect the model's intrinsic preferences for frames that best support temporally grounded responses. To efficiently explore the large combinatorial frame space, we employ an autoregressive, conditional selection architecture that ensures temporal coherence while reducing complexity. Our approach does not require explicit supervision at the frame-level and consistently improves reasoning performance across multiple video QA benchmarks, highlighting the benefits of aligning frame selection with model-internal utility.

<title>TSRating: Rating Quality of Diverse Time Series Data by Meta-learning from LLM Judgment</title>

Abstract: High-quality time series (TS) data are essential for ensuring TS model performance, rendering research on rating TS data quality indispensable. Existing methods have shown promising rating accuracy within individual domains, primarily by extending data quality rating techniques such as influence functions and Shapley values to account for temporal characteristics. However, they neglect the fact that real-world TS data can span vastly different domains and exhibit distinct properties, hampering the accurate and efficient rating of diverse TS data. In this paper, we propose TSRating, a novel and unified framework for rating the quality of time series data crawled from diverse domains. TSRating is built on the assumption that LLMs inherit ample knowledge, acquired during their extensive pretraining, enabling them to comprehend and discern quality differences in diverse TS data. We verify this assumption by devising a series of prompts to elicit quality comparisons from LLMs for pairs of TS samples. We then fit a dedicated rating model, termed TSRater, to convert the LLMs' judgments into efficient quality predictions via TSRater's inference on future TS samples. To ensure cross-domain adaptability, we develop a meta-learning scheme to train TSRater on quality comparisons collected from nine distinct domains. To improve training efficiency, we employ signSGD for inner-loop updates, thus circumventing the demanding computation of hypergradients. Extensive experimental results on eleven benchmark datasets across three time series tasks, each using both conventional TS models and TS foundation models, demonstrate that TSRating outperforms baselines in terms of estimation accuracy, efficiency, and domain adaptability.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic reasoning capacities. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/zjukg/M3STR

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), significantly enhancing their capabilities by integrating visual information and other types, thus aligning more closely with the nature of human intelligence, which processes a variety of data forms beyond just text. Despite advancements, the undesirable generation of these models remains a critical concern, particularly due to vulnerabilities exposed by text-based jailbreak attacks, which have represented a significant threat by challenging existing safety protocols. Motivated by the unique security risks posed by the integration of new and old modalities for MLLMs, we propose a unified multimodal universal jailbreak attack framework that leverages iterative image-text interactions and transfer-based strategy to generate a universal adversarial suffix and image. Our work not only highlights the interaction of image-text modalities can be used as a critical vulnerability but also validates that multimodal universal jailbreak attacks can bring higher-quality undesirable generations across different MLLMs. We evaluate the undesirable context generation of MLLMs like LLaVA, Yi-VL, MiniGPT4, MiniGPT-v2, and InstructBLIP, and reveal significant multimodal safety alignment issues, highlighting the inadequacy of current safety mechanisms against sophisticated multimodal attacks. This study underscores the urgent need for robust safety measures in MLLMs, advocating for a comprehensive review and enhancement of security protocols to mitigate potential risks associated with multimodal capabilities.

Abstract: Instruction tuning is essential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively follow user instructions. To improve training efficiency and reduce data redundancy, recent works use LLM-based scoring functions, e.g., Instruction-Following Difficulty (IFD), to select high-quality instruction-tuning data with scores above a threshold. While these data selection methods often lead to models that can match or even exceed the performance of models trained on the full datasets, we identify two key limitations: (i) they assess quality at the sample level, ignoring token-level informativeness; and (ii) they overlook the robustness of the scoring method, often selecting a sample due to superficial lexical features instead of its true quality. In this work, we propose Token-Selective HIeRarchical Data Selection for Instruction Tuning (T-SHIRT), a novel data selection framework that introduces a new scoring method to include only informative tokens in quality evaluation and also promotes robust and reliable samples whose neighbors also show high quality with less local inconsistencies. We demonstrate that models instruction-tuned on a curated dataset (only 5% of the original size) using T-SHIRT can outperform those trained on the entire large-scale dataset by up to 5.48 points on average across eight benchmarks. Across various LLMs and training set scales, our method consistently surpasses existing state-of-the-art data selection techniques, while also remaining both cost-effective and highly efficient. For instance, by using GPT-2 for score computation, we are able to process a dataset of 52k samples using 40 minutes on a single GPU.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to expunge a designated forget set from a trained model without costly retraining, yet the existing techniques overlook two critical blind spots: "over-unlearning" that deteriorates retained data near the forget set, and post-hoc "relearning" attacks that aim to resurrect the forgotten knowledge. We first derive the over-unlearning metric OU@{\epsilon}, which represents the collateral damage to the nearby region of the forget set, where the over-unlearning mainly appears. Next, we expose an unforeseen relearning threat on MU, i.e., the Prototypical Relearning Attack, which exploits the per-class prototype of the forget class with just a few samples, and easily restores the pre-unlearning performance. To counter both blind spots, we introduce Spotter, a plug-and-play objective that combines (i) a masked knowledge-distillation penalty on the nearby region of forget set to suppress OU@{\epsilon}, and (ii) an intra-class dispersion loss that scatters forget-class embeddings, neutralizing prototypical relearning attacks. On CIFAR-10, as one of validations, Spotter reduces OU@{\epsilon}by below the 0.05X of the baseline, drives forget accuracy to 0%, preserves accuracy of the retain set within 1% of difference with the original, and denies the prototype-attack by keeping the forget set accuracy within <1%, without accessing retained data. It confirms that Spotter is a practical remedy of the unlearning's blind spots.

Abstract: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as demonstrated in our experiments.

Abstract: Federated Class-Incremental Learning (FCIL) enables Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) from distributed data. Existing FCIL methods typically integrate old knowledge preservation into local client training. However, these methods cannot avoid spatial-temporal client drift caused by data heterogeneity and often incur significant computational and communication overhead, limiting practical deployment. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel approach, Spatial-Temporal Statistics Aggregation (STSA), which provides a unified framework to aggregate feature statistics both spatially (across clients) and temporally (across stages). The aggregated feature statistics are unaffected by data heterogeneity and can be used to update the classifier in closed form at each stage. Additionally, we introduce STSA-E, a communication-efficient variant with theoretical guarantees, achieving similar performance to STSA-E with much lower communication overhead. Extensive experiments on three widely used FCIL datasets, with varying degrees of data heterogeneity, show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art FCIL methods in terms of performance, flexibility, and both communication and computation efficiency.

Abstract: Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540 annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline, assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection, suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across 15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779), and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B) surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open- and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) plays a crucial role in extending the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by enabling integration with external tools and data sources. However, the standard MCP specification presents significant security vulnerabilities, notably Tool Poisoning and Rug Pull attacks. This paper introduces the Enhanced Tool Definition Interface (ETDI), a security extension designed to fortify MCP. ETDI incorporates cryptographic identity verification, immutable versioned tool definitions, and explicit permission management, often leveraging OAuth 2.0. We further propose extending MCP with fine-grained, policy-based access control, where tool capabilities are dynamically evaluated against explicit policies using a dedicated policy engine, considering runtime context beyond static OAuth scopes. This layered approach aims to establish a more secure, trustworthy, and controllable ecosystem for AI applications interacting with LLMs and external tools.

<title>NoiseAR: AutoRegressing Initial Noise Prior for Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks, creating data samples by progressively denoising an initial random state. Traditionally, this initial state is sampled from a simple, fixed distribution like isotropic Gaussian, inherently lacking structure and a direct mechanism for external control. While recent efforts have explored ways to introduce controllability into the diffusion process, particularly at the initialization stage, they often rely on deterministic or heuristic approaches. These methods can be suboptimal, lack expressiveness, and are difficult to scale or integrate into more sophisticated optimization frameworks. In this paper, we introduce NoiseAR, a novel method for AutoRegressive Initial Noise Prior for Diffusion Models. Instead of a static, unstructured source, NoiseAR learns to generate a dynamic and controllable prior distribution for the initial noise. We formulate the generation of the initial noise prior's parameters as an autoregressive probabilistic modeling task over spatial patches or tokens. This approach enables NoiseAR to capture complex spatial dependencies and introduce learned structure into the initial state. Crucially, NoiseAR is designed to be conditional, allowing text prompts to directly influence the learned prior, thereby achieving fine-grained control over the diffusion initialization. Our experiments demonstrate that NoiseAR can generate initial noise priors that lead to improved sample quality and enhanced consistency with conditional inputs, offering a powerful, learned alternative to traditional random initialization. A key advantage of NoiseAR is its probabilistic formulation, which naturally supports seamless integration into probabilistic frameworks like Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning. Our code will be available at https://github.com/HKUST-SAIL/NoiseAR/

Abstract: Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions, ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues. The KokoroChat dataset is available at https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/KokoroChat.

<title>Unraveling Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models via the Pipeline Lens: A Comprehensive Review</title>

Abstract: Spatio-temporal deep learning models aims to utilize useful patterns in such data to support tasks like prediction. However, previous deep learning models designed for specific tasks typically require separate training for each use case, leading to increased computational and storage costs. To address this issue, spatio-temporal foundation models have emerged, offering a unified framework capable of solving multiple spatio-temporal tasks. These foundation models achieve remarkable success by learning general knowledge with spatio-temporal data or transferring the general capabilities of pre-trained language models. While previous surveys have explored spatio-temporal data and methodologies separately, they have ignored a comprehensive examination of how foundation models are designed, selected, pre-trained, and adapted. As a result, the overall pipeline for spatio-temporal foundation models remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we innovatively provide an up-to-date review of previous spatio-temporal foundation models from the pipeline perspective. The pipeline begins with an introduction to different types of spatio-temporal data, followed by details of data preprocessing and embedding techniques. The pipeline then presents a novel data property taxonomy to divide existing methods according to data sources and dependencies, providing efficient and effective model design and selection for researchers. On this basis, we further illustrate the training objectives of primitive models, as well as the adaptation techniques of transferred models. Overall, our survey provides a clear and structured pipeline to understand the connection between core elements of spatio-temporal foundation models while guiding researchers to get started quickly. Additionally, we introduce emerging opportunities such as multi-objective training in the field of spatio-temporal foundation models.

<title>Incentivizing LLMs to Self-Verify Their Answers</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks through both post-training and test-time scaling laws. While prevalent test-time scaling approaches are often realized by using external reward models to guide the model generation process, we find only marginal gains can be acquired when scaling a model post-trained on specific reasoning tasks. We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model can further scale its performance during inference time by verifying its generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating its capabilities across varying reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance but also enable effective test-time scaling.

<title>Compiler Optimization via LLM Reasoning for Efficient Model Serving</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01374</link>

Abstract: While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimization to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed REASONING COMPILER) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process, guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-aware transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.

<title>Playing with Transformer at 30+ FPS via Next-Frame Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless, achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation. To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models, enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

Abstract: Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) has emerged as a critical field in document intelligence, enabling automated extraction of key information from complex documents across domains such as medical, financial, and educational applications. However, form-like documents pose unique challenges due to their complex layouts, multi-stakeholder involvement, and high structural variability. Addressing these issues, the VRD-IU Competition was introduced, focusing on extracting and localizing key information from multi-format forms within the Form-NLU dataset, which includes digital, printed, and handwritten documents. This paper presents insights from the competition, which featured two tracks: Track A, emphasizing entity-based key information retrieval, and Track B, targeting end-to-end key information localization from raw document images. With over 20 participating teams, the competition showcased various state-of-the-art methodologies, including hierarchical decomposition, transformer-based retrieval, multimodal feature fusion, and advanced object detection techniques. The top-performing models set new benchmarks in VRDU, providing valuable insights into document intelligence.

<title>Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model Planning</title>

Abstract: World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make informed choices. However, ensuring the prediction accuracy of world models often demands substantial computational resources, posing a major challenge for real-time applications. This computational burden is particularly restrictive in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped attention strategy, allowing the model to adaptively adjust the number of tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse imagination (rollout), our approach significantly accelerates planning while maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference efficiency, paving the way for the deployment of world models in real-time decision-making scenarios.

<div> Keywords: world models, flexible behavior, goal-directed tasks, predictive model, agent performance

Summary: 
Agents capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of their environment. This model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and improving performance or achieving more complex goals requires increasingly accurate world models. The presence of world models is crucial for developing safe and general agents, as well as setting bounds on agent capabilities in complex environments. Additionally, new algorithms can be devised for eliciting world models from agents, enhancing our understanding of their behavior and decision-making processes. World models serve as a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behavior, highlighting their importance in designing efficient and effective autonomous systems.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

<div> Keywords: large language models, multi-agent system, dynamic maneuvering, system identification, GAIA dataset

Summary:<br>
The article proposes a dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS) in the AWorld framework to enhance the reliability of intelligent agents leveraging external tools. The MAS consists of an Execution Agent supervised by a Guard Agent that provides on-demand dynamic maneuvering to improve robustness. The architecture is further enhanced with a system identification methodology that creates a "performance fingerprint" of the Execution Agent's weaknesses. This fingerprint is used by the Guard Agent for online profile-aware supervision, allowing targeted interventions based on known failure patterns. Experimental results on the GAIA dataset demonstrate that the profile-aware MAS significantly improves effectiveness and stability, surpassing single-agent systems and naive counterparts. The system attained first place on the GAIA leaderboard, showcasing the importance of understanding each agent's capabilities and limitations for building trustworthy intelligent systems.<br> <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex real-world problems. However, this reliance introduces new challenges, as extended contexts and noisy tool outputs can undermine system reliability. To address this, we propose a dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS) in our AWorld framework, where an Execution Agent is supervised by a Guard Agent that provides on-demand dynamic maneuvering, verifying and correcting the reasoning process to improve robustness over single-agent systems. To move beyond this generic supervision, we enhance the architecture with a methodology inspired by System Identification from control theory. This method first profiles the Execution Agent offline on a benchmark dataset to create a "performance fingerprint" of its unique weaknesses. The Guard Agent then leverages this fingerprint online to deliver profile-aware supervision, making targeted interventions based on known failure patterns rather than merely reacting to immediate logical flaws. Extensive experiments on the GAIA dataset demonstrate that this profile-aware MAS significantly improves both effectiveness and stability, outperforming not only single-agent systems but also its naive counterpart. This superior performance led our system to achieve first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA leaderboard. These findings highlight that building truly trustworthy intelligent systems requires not just collaboration, but a deep, empirically-grounded understanding of each agent's unique capabilities and limitations.

<div> keywords: clinical workflows, data-driven model identification, healthcare-first framework, vision-language model, single-model deployment

Summary:
Clinical workflows in healthcare are often fragmented and inefficient, involving multiple scripts and task-specific networks. This study introduces a healthcare-first framework using a single vision-language model (VLM) in two roles. Firstly, the VLM acts as a model-card matcher, routing images to specialist models through a three-stage workflow with checks for prompt exit and candidate selection. Secondly, the VLM is fine-tuned on specialty-specific datasets to cover multiple tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance across various medical fields. Compared to pipelines with task-specific agents, this approach demonstrates that a single VLM can effectively make decisions and perform tasks, reducing the effort of data scientists, increasing transparency in model selection, and simplifying deployment. This framework has the potential to streamline clinical workflows, reduce operational costs, and improve overall efficiency in healthcare settings. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Clinical workflows are fragmented as a patchwork of scripts and task-specific networks that often handle triage, task selection, and model deployment. These pipelines are rarely streamlined for data science pipeline, reducing efficiency and raising operational costs. Workflows also lack data-driven model identification (from imaging/tabular inputs) and standardized delivery of model outputs. In response, we present a practical, healthcare-first framework that uses a single vision-language model (VLM) in two complementary roles. First (Solution 1), the VLM acts as an aware model-card matcher that routes an incoming image to the appropriate specialist model via a three-stage workflow (modality -> primary abnormality -> model-card id). Checks are provided by (i) stagewise prompts that allow early exit via None/Normal/Other and (ii) a stagewise answer selector that arbitrates between the top-2 candidates at each stage, reducing the chance of an incorrect selection and aligning the workflow with clinical risk tolerance. Second (Solution 2), we fine-tune the VLM on specialty-specific datasets ensuring a single model covers multiple downstream tasks within each specialty, maintaining performance while simplifying deployment. Across gastroenterology, hematology, ophthalmology, and pathology, our single-model deployment matches or approaches specialized baselines.
  Compared with pipelines composed of many task-specific agents, this approach shows that one VLM can both decide and do. It may reduce effort by data scientists, shorten monitoring, increase the transparency of model selection (with per-stage justifications), and lower integration overhead.

<div> Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree, semi-structured table, question answering, large language models, ST-Raptor <br>
Summary: <br>
ST-Raptor is a tree-based framework designed for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. It introduces the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree) to capture complex table layouts and define basic tree operations for guiding language models. The framework decomposes user questions into sub-questions, generates operation pipelines, and aligns operations with table structures for accurate execution. A two-stage verification mechanism ensures answer reliability through forward and backward validation. The method outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy on the SSTQA dataset of 764 questions across 102 real-world semi-structured tables. The code for ST-Raptor is openly available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Semi-structured tables, widely used in real-world applications (e.g., financial reports, medical records, transactional orders), often involve flexible and complex layouts (e.g., hierarchical headers and merged cells). These tables generally rely on human analysts to interpret table layouts and answer relevant natural language questions, which is costly and inefficient. To automate the procedure, existing methods face significant challenges. First, methods like NL2SQL require converting semi-structured tables into structured ones, which often causes substantial information loss. Second, methods like NL2Code and multi-modal LLM QA struggle to understand the complex layouts of semi-structured tables and cannot accurately answer corresponding questions. To this end, we propose ST-Raptor, a tree-based framework for semi-structured table question answering using large language models. First, we introduce the Hierarchical Orthogonal Tree (HO-Tree), a structural model that captures complex semi-structured table layouts, along with an effective algorithm for constructing the tree. Second, we define a set of basic tree operations to guide LLMs in executing common QA tasks. Given a user question, ST-Raptor decomposes it into simpler sub-questions, generates corresponding tree operation pipelines, and conducts operation-table alignment for accurate pipeline execution. Third, we incorporate a two-stage verification mechanism: forward validation checks the correctness of execution steps, while backward validation evaluates answer reliability by reconstructing queries from predicted answers. To benchmark the performance, we present SSTQA, a dataset of 764 questions over 102 real-world semi-structured tables. Experiments show that ST-Raptor outperforms nine baselines by up to 20% in answer accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/weAIDB/ST-Raptor.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless, their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge. Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs while enhancing agent performance.

The framework is based on four core principles: Experience Exploration, Long-term Memory, Skill Learning, and Knowledge Internalization. Agents learn through interaction with dynamic environments, preserve historical knowledge in a memory system, improve by abstracting patterns into skills, and internalize explicit experiences into intuitive capabilities.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous, self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory: Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife is designed around three key paradigm

Summary:<br>
- The study introduces APME, a reinforcement learning-based framework for estimating question difficulty in Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS).
- APME uses solver performance data, such as marks obtained and time taken, to estimate difficulty without requiring linguistic features or expert labels.

- Empirical validation on three datasets showed the model's robustness, accuracy, and adaptability across different educational levels and assessment formats.
- APME consistently outperformed baseline approaches, particularly in symbolic domains like algebra, highlighting the importance of item heterogeneity and variance in solver outcomes for adaptive allocation.
- Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development by balancing challenge and attainability in tasks to support motivation and minimize disengagement.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential. Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based, NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii) variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability, supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic, self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Summary:
The paper introduces the Chain-of-Intent framework, combining Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intent-driven dialogues in conversational AI systems. By extracting intent transition patterns from e-commerce chat logs, the model generates context-aware dialogues through self-play. The integration of LLMs with HMMs allows for the creation of natural utterances aligned with predicted intents and dialogue context. Additionally, the paper proposes MINT-CL, a multi-task contrastive learning framework for multi-turn intent classification, improving performance and reducing reliance on large annotated datasets. Empirical results demonstrate superior dialogue generation quality and classification accuracy, especially in multilingual settings. The release of MINT-E, a multilingual intent-aware dialogue corpus from the e-commerce domain, aims to facilitate further research in this area.

Abstract: In conversational AI systems, a critical challenge in training effective multi-turn intent classification models lies in the generation of large-scale, domain-specific, multilingual dialogue datasets. In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Intent, a novel framework that integrates Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate intent-driven, context-aware dialogues through self-play. Our method first extracts domain-specific intent transition patterns from real-world e-commerce chat logs, which guide the modeling of turn-level dynamics and intent sequences. LLMs are then employed to parameterize the emission probabilities of HMMs, enabling the generation of natural, coherent utterances aligned with predicted intents and dialogue context. We also propose MINT-CL, a multi-task contrastive learning framework for multi-turn intent classification, which improves performance while reducing dependence on large-scale annotated datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach outperforms competitive baselines in dialogue generation quality and classification accuracy, particularly in multilingual settings. To facilitate future research, we release MINT-E, a comprehensive, multilingual, intent-aware multi-turn dialogue corpus derived from the e-commerce domain\footnote{The reproduced source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/junhua/chain-of-intent.

Summary:
In the field of medical imaging, the integration of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) has shown promise in enhancing the detection of retinal diseases. A novel hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture has been introduced to combine the local feature extraction of CNNs with the global dependency capture of ViTs. Unlike existing hybrid models, this architecture is designed to be interpretable, providing localized evidence maps that directly reflect the decision-making process. By incorporating both CNN and Transformer components, the model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance in disease detection tasks using color fundus images. The approach outperforms both black-box and interpretable models, offering class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass. The availability of the code further enhances the reproducibility and accessibility of this innovative method. <div>
arXiv:2504.08481v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many medical imaging tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) efficiently extract local features hierarchically. More recently, vision transformers (ViTs) have gained popularity, using self-attention mechanisms to capture global dependencies, but lacking the inherent spatial localization of convolutions. Therefore, hybrid models combining CNNs and ViTs have been developed to combine the strengths of both architectures. However, such hybrid models are difficult to interpret, which hinders their application in medical imaging. In this work, we introduce an interpretable-by-design hybrid fully convolutional CNN-Transformer architecture for retinal disease detection. Unlike widely used post-hoc saliency methods for ViTs, our approach generates faithful and localized evidence maps that directly reflect the mode's decision process. We evaluated our method on two medical tasks focused on disease detection using color fundus images. Our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance compared to black-box and interpretable models and provides class-specific sparse evidence maps in a single forward pass.

Summary: 
This study focuses on wrist pathologies in children, utilizing a multifaceted approach involving fine-grained recognition, computer vision, and metadata integration. The research addresses the challenge of limited medical imaging datasets by combining patient metadata with X-rays and leveraging fine-grained weights from a separate dataset. This innovative approach, including fine-grained transformer methods and pre-training, resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy. The study demonstrates a 2% increase in accuracy on a small curated dataset and over 10% increase on a larger fracture dataset. Furthermore, this is the first application of metadata integration for wrist pathology recognition, showcasing the potential of combining data types for enhanced diagnostic outcomes.<br> <div>
arXiv:2507.12964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wrist pathologies are frequently observed, particularly among children who constitute the majority of fracture cases. Computer vision presents a promising avenue, contingent upon the availability of extensive datasets, a notable challenge in medical imaging. Therefore, reliance solely on one modality, such as images, proves inadequate, especially in an era of diverse and plentiful data types. This study addresses the problem using a multifaceted approach: framing it as a fine-grained recognition task, fusing patient metadata with X-rays, and leveraging weights from a separate fine-grained dataset rather than from a coarse-grained dataset like ImageNet. Unlike prior work, this is the first application of metadata integration for wrist pathology recognition. Our results show that combining fine-grained transformer approach, fine-grained pre-training, and metadata integration improves diagnostic accuracy by 2% on small custom curated dataset and over 10% on a larger fracture dataset.

Summary:<br>
The Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 is a hybrid language model designed to improve throughput for reasoning tasks while maintaining high accuracy. It replaces self-attention layers with Mamba-2 layers to enhance inference speed for generating reasoning traces.

Compared to similar models like Qwen3-8B, Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 demonstrates comparable or better accuracy on reasoning tasks with up to 6x higher inference throughput in scenarios with 8k input and 16k output tokens. The models and datasets are made available on Hugging Face for further research and development.

Abstract: We introduce Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, a hybrid Mamba-Transformer language model designed to increase throughput for reasoning workloads while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to similarly-sized models. Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 builds on the Nemotron-H architecture, in which the majority of the self-attention layers in the common Transformer architecture are replaced with Mamba-2 layers, to achieve improved inference speed when generating the long thinking traces needed for reasoning. We create Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 by first pre-training a 12-billion-parameter model (Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base) on 20 trillion tokens using an FP8 training recipe. After aligning Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-Base, we employ the Minitron strategy to compress and distill the model with the goal of enabling inference on up to 128k tokens on a single NVIDIA A10G GPU (22GiB of memory, bfloat16 precision). Compared to existing similarly-sized models (e.g., Qwen3-8B), we show that Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 achieves on-par or better accuracy on reasoning benchmarks while achieving up to 6x higher inference throughput in reasoning settings like 8k input and 16k output tokens. We are releasing Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2, Nemotron-Nano12B-v2-Base, and Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base checkpoints along with the majority of our pre- and post-training datasets on Hugging Face.

<div> Keywords: GPT-OSS-20B, Mixture-of-Experts, throughput, energy efficiency, peak VRAM <br>
Summary: <br>
The study evaluates the performance of GPT-OSS-20B, a Mixture-of-Experts model with 20.9B parameters, on a single GPU against dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B. The evaluation includes measuring true time-to-first-token, full-decode throughput, end-to-end latency percentiles, peak VRAM with past key values, and energy consumption. GPT-OSS-20B shows higher decode throughput and energy efficiency, with lower peak VRAM usage compared to the baselines. Despite a higher time-to-first-token due to MoE routing overhead, GPT-OSS-20B demonstrates superior performance with only 17.3% of parameters active. The model offers higher decode throughput and lower energy consumption per 1000 tokens generated compared to Qwen3-32B, while using less peak VRAM. The study highlights the deployment advantages of Mixture-of-Experts models in terms of efficiency and performance. The evaluation does not consider accuracy, focusing instead on deployment aspects. The code and results are made available for replication and further research. <div>

Abstract: We present a single-GPU (H100, bf16) evaluation of GPT-OSS-20B (Mixture-of-Experts; 20.9B total, approx. 3.61B active) against dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B across multiple dimensions. We measure true time-to-first-token (TTFT), full-decode throughput (TPOT), end-to-end latency percentiles, peak VRAM with past key values (PKV) held, and energy via a consistent nvidia-smi-based sampler. At a 2048-token context with 64-token decode, GPT-OSS-20B delivers higher decode throughput and tokens per Joule than dense baselines Qwen3-32B and Yi-34B, while substantially reducing peak VRAM and energy per 1000 generated tokens; its TTFT is higher due to MoE routing overhead. With only 17.3% of parameters active (3.61B of 20.9B), GPT-OSS-20B provides about 31.8% higher decode throughput and 25.8% lower energy per 1000 generated tokens than Qwen3-32B at 2048/64, while using 31.7% less peak VRAM. Normalized by active parameters, GPT-OSS-20B shows markedly stronger per-active-parameter efficiency (APE), underscoring MoE's deployment advantages. We do not evaluate accuracy; this is a deployment-focused study. We release code and consolidated results to enable replication and extension.

<div> optimization, deep neural networks, acceleration techniques, mixed precision, batch size scaling

Summary:
Tri-Accel is a unified optimization framework that combines three acceleration strategies for deep neural networks. It dynamically assigns mixed-precision levels to layers, exploits sparsity patterns for second-order signals, and adjusts batch size in real time based on GPU memory availability. On CIFAR-10, Tri-Accel reduces training time by up to 9.9% and memory usage by 13.3%, while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. It demonstrates adaptive learning behavior on CIFAR-10/100, gradually improving efficiency as training progresses. Compared to static mixed-precision training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint on standard hardware. The framework, implemented with custom Triton kernels, enables automatic optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for diverse computational environments. This work shows how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can enhance scalability in resource-constrained settings, leading to more efficient neural network training for edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly bottlenecked by the cost of optimization, both in terms of GPU memory and compute time. Existing acceleration techniques, such as mixed precision, second-order methods, and batch size scaling, are typically used in isolation. We present Tri-Accel, a unified optimization framework that co-adapts three acceleration strategies along with adaptive parameters during training: (1) Precision-Adaptive Updates that dynamically assign mixed-precision levels to layers based on curvature and gradient variance; (2) Sparse Second-Order Signals that exploit Hessian/Fisher sparsity patterns to guide precision and step size decisions; and (3) Memory-Elastic Batch Scaling that adjusts batch size in real time according to VRAM availability. On CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0, Tri-Accel achieves up to 9.9% reduction in training time and 13.3% lower memory usage, while improving accuracy by +1.1 percentage points over FP32 baselines. Tested on CIFAR-10/100, our approach demonstrates adaptive learning behavior, with efficiency gradually improving over the course of training as the system learns to allocate resources more effectively. Compared to static mixed-precision training, Tri-Accel maintains 78.1% accuracy while reducing memory footprint from 0.35GB to 0.31GB on standard hardware. The framework is implemented with custom Triton kernels, whose hardware-aware adaptation enables automatic optimization without manual hyperparameter tuning, making it practical for deployment across diverse computational environments. This work demonstrates how algorithmic adaptivity and hardware awareness can be combined to improve scalability in resource-constrained settings, paving the way for more efficient neural network training on edge devices and cost-sensitive cloud deployments.

<div> Keywords: Orthogonal Gradient Descent, Natural Gradient, Continual Learning, EKFAC, Riemannian Metric

Summary:
Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) has proven effective for continual learning but lacks efficiency in leveraging information-geometric structures. To address this, the Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent (ONG) method is proposed, which incorporates the natural gradient and a Riemannian metric. ONG preconditions task-specific gradients using an EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix. To maintain performance on previous tasks, ONG projects natural gradients orthogonal to prior task gradients. Initial theoretical justification and preliminary results on benchmark datasets are provided. However, challenges in the combination of natural gradients and orthogonal projections highlight the need for further research to reconcile geometric perspectives and enhance method robustness. Future work aims to establish formal convergence guarantees, validate on larger-scale benchmarks, and refine the method. The anonymized code for the study is available for exploration. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) has emerged as a powerful method for continual learning. However, its Euclidean projections do not leverage the underlying information-geometric structure of the problem, which can lead to suboptimal convergence in learning tasks. To address this, we propose incorporating the natural gradient into OGD and present \textbf{ONG (Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent)}. ONG preconditions each new task-specific gradient with an efficient EKFAC approximation of the inverse Fisher information matrix, yielding updates that follow the steepest descent direction under a Riemannian metric. To preserve performance on previously learned tasks, ONG projects these natural gradients onto the orthogonal complement of prior tasks' gradients. We provide an initial theoretical justification for this procedure, introduce the Orthogonal Natural Gradient Descent (ONG) algorithm, and present preliminary results on the Permuted and Rotated MNIST benchmarks. Our preliminary results, however, indicate that a naive combination of natural gradients and orthogonal projections can have potential issues. This finding motivates continued future work focused on robustly reconciling these geometric perspectives to develop a continual learning method, establishing a more rigorous theoretical foundation with formal convergence guarantees, and extending empirical validation to large-scale continual learning benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, overconfidence, assertiveness, mechanistic interpretability, dual-route Elaboration Likelihood Model

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit overconfidence, presenting information with unwarranted certainty in critical situations. This study delves into the internal mechanisms driving this behavior through mechanistic interpretability. By analyzing Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on assertiveness datasets, the researchers extract residual activations and identify layers sensitive to assertiveness contrasts. They reveal that high-assertive representations in LLMs consist of emotional and logical sub-components, akin to the dual-route Elaboration Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these sub-components demonstrate distinct effects, with emotional vectors broadly influencing prediction accuracy and logical vectors exerting more localized effects. This mechanistic insight sheds light on the multi-component nature of LLM assertiveness and suggests potential strategies for mitigating overconfidence in LLM behavior.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often display overconfidence, presenting information with unwarranted certainty in high-stakes contexts. We investigate the internal basis of this behavior via mechanistic interpretability. Using open-sourced Llama 3.2 models fine-tuned on human annotated assertiveness datasets, we extract residual activations across all layers, and compute similarity metrics to localize assertive representations. Our analysis identifies layers most sensitive to assertiveness contrasts and reveals that high-assertive representations decompose into two orthogonal sub-components of emotional and logical clusters-paralleling the dual-route Elaboration Likelihood Model in Psychology. Steering vectors derived from these sub-components show distinct causal effects: emotional vectors broadly influence prediction accuracy, while logical vectors exert more localized effects. These findings provide mechanistic evidence for the multi-component structure of LLM assertiveness and highlight avenues for mitigating overconfident behavior.

<div> Keywords: Large Vision-Language Models, token pruning, computational efficiency, multimodal inputs, CoViPAL <br>
Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in processing multimodal inputs, particularly in handling the high computational costs and memory overhead associated with large numbers of vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Existing methods have struggled to effectively prune redundant vision tokens, especially in shallow layers where contextual information is lacking. The proposed CoViPAL approach introduces a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM, improving computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. CoViPAL is lightweight, model-agnostic, and can seamlessly integrate with various LVLM architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms both training-free and training-based pruning methods under equal token budgets, offering a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing inference efficiency in LVLMs. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens, leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations. However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight, model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

<div> Keywords: AI agents, software engineering, code generation, intent inference, verification and validation

Summary:
AI agents in software engineering extend beyond code generation, encompassing tasks like testing, program repair, architecture exploration, and requirements understanding. A key challenge lies in deciphering developer intent, essential for tasks like software maintenance. Trust in AI agents is crucial as automation increases, leading to higher volumes of code integration. The future of software workflows may involve AI-based verification and validation for code generated by AI agents. Conceptual progress in intent inference is essential for deploying agentic technology successfully in software engineering. Trustworthy agentic AI software workflows depend on resolving the core challenge of interpreting developer intent, enabling autonomous decision-making by AI agents. AI-based V&V is an emerging direction in handling the proliferation of automatically generated code, indicating a future where AI plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and quality of code bases. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.17343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents have recently shown significant promise in software engineering. Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt.
  At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team.
  Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents.
  Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&amp;V.

Summary: Drug discovery is a complex process, and predicting drug approval outcomes early is essential for efficient resource allocation. Traditional machine learning and deep learning models lack interpretability, limiting their impact. DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model, integrates molecular descriptors and comparative reasoning to predict small-molecule approval likelihood. It outperformed baseline models, including logistic regression and support vector machines, achieving competitive performance with XGBoost. DrugReasoner also outperformed the ChemAP model on an external dataset, demonstrating robustness in real-world scenarios. Not only does DrugReasoner deliver accurate predictions, but it also enhances transparency through reasoning outputs, addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug discovery. <div>

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments. While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval. DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores. DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set, respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Summary:
This paper presents a comparative analysis of four dysfluency detection approaches, namely YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM, focusing on performance, controllability, and explainability. The evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment reveals that YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet offer efficiency but have limited transparency, while UDM strikes a balance between accuracy and clinical interpretability. SSDM shows promise but could not be fully reproduced in the experiments. The analysis underscores the trade-offs among the approaches and suggests future directions for dysfluency modeling for clinical use. Implementation insights and practical deployment considerations for each approach are also provided.

Abstract: Recent advances in dysfluency detection have introduced a variety of modeling paradigms, ranging from lightweight object-detection inspired networks (YOLOStutter) to modular interpretable frameworks (UDM). While performance on benchmark datasets continues to improve, clinical adoption requires more than accuracy: models must be controllable and explainable. In this paper, we present a systematic comparative analysis of four representative approaches--YOLO-Stutter, FluentNet, UDM, and SSDM--along three dimensions: performance, controllability, and explainability. Through comprehensive evaluation on multiple datasets and expert clinician assessment, we find that YOLO-Stutter and FluentNet provide efficiency and simplicity, but with limited transparency; UDM achieves the best balance of accuracy and clinical interpretability; and SSDM, while promising, could not be fully reproduced in our experiments. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs among competing approaches and identifies future directions for clinically viable dysfluency modeling. We also provide detailed implementation insights and practical deployment considerations for each approach.

Summary: 
This study evaluates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using a framework that synthesizes research-level questions directly from arXiv papers. The study considers models with different knowledge cutoff dates and sizes, finding no significant performance decay near the cutoff dates. The authors compare their results with previous studies that reported post-cutoff performance decay, suggesting that the multi-step reasoning required by their synthesis pipeline may mitigate benchmark contamination. The study advocates for prioritizing reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over collecting new questions periodically. Overall, the results indicate that LLMs can handle complex reasoning tasks without succumbing to memorization, highlighting the importance of thoughtful benchmark construction in evaluating model capabilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capability evaluation of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly shadowed by rising concerns of data contamination that cast doubts on whether static benchmarks measure genuine reasoning or mere memorization. We present an empirical study using an infinitely scalable framework to synthesize research-level QA directly from arXiv papers, harnessing the natural temporal structure of research publications where performance decay after knowledge cutoffs may indicate potential contamination. We evaluated 4 frontier model represented by 2 models of different knowledge cutoff dates per family on 1,643 multi-step reasoning questions synthesized from 20,277 arXiv papers stratified over 26 months, covering at least 6 months before and after all cutoff dates. Our results consistently showed a lack of significant performance decay near knowledge cutoff dates for models of various sizes, developers, and release dates. We further performed a comparative analysis with previous longitudinal studies that reported significant post-cutoff performance decay using directly retrieved questions based on public data. we hypothesize that the multi-step reasoning required by our synthesis pipeline offered additional complexity that goes deeper than shallow memorization, which effectively serves a mitigation strategy against benchmark contamination. We fully open source our code and dataset to aid reproducibility and advocate for a paradigm shift that prioritize reasoning-driven synthesis to construct benchmarks over simply collecting newly released questions periodically.

Summary:
The article presents a computational framework for modeling social learning through joint probabilistic inference over structured world models using sensorimotor and linguistic data. By leveraging a pretrained language model as a probabilistic model of how humans share advice, agents can generate and interpret advice for learning and exploration. Linguistic guidance is shown to aid in shaping exploration, accelerating learning, reducing risky interactions, and speeding up discoveries in both humans and AI models. The study also examines how knowledge can accumulate through iterated learning experiments and successful knowledge transfer between humans and AI models. The research highlights the potential of structured, language-compatible representations in facilitating human-machine collaborative learning. <div>

Abstract: The ability to combine linguistic guidance from others with direct experience is central to human development, enabling safe and rapid learning in new environments. How do people integrate these two sources of knowledge, and how might AI systems? We present a computational framework that models social learning as joint probabilistic inference over structured, executable world models given sensorimotor and linguistic data. We make this possible by turning a pretrained language model into a probabilistic model of how humans share advice conditioned on their beliefs, allowing our agents both to generate advice for others and to interpret linguistic input as evidence during Bayesian inference. Using behavioral experiments and simulations across 10 video games, we show how linguistic guidance can shape exploration and accelerate learning by reducing risky interactions and speeding up key discoveries in both humans and models. We further explore how knowledge can accumulate across generations through iterated learning experiments and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer between humans and models -- revealing how structured, language-compatible representations might enable human-machine collaborative learning.

<div> uncertainty, refinement, reasoning, lightweight, cost-efficiency 
Summary: 
In the study presented, a method called entropy-guided refinement is proposed to improve the performance of reasoning models while reducing cost and latency. This lightweight test-time loop utilizes token-level uncertainty to trigger a targeted refinement pass, achieving 95% accuracy compared to a reference model at one-third of the cost. The approach involves extracting log probabilities, calculating Shannon entropy, and using a simple trigger based on perplexity, token entropy, and low-confidence tokens to guide corrective edits. By passing an uncertainty report back to the model, selective refinement is applied to approximately 31% of responses, resulting in a 16-percentage point accuracy improvement over single-pass inference. This method offers a practical middle ground between single-pass inference and resource-intensive reasoning chains, making it suitable for production deployments where balancing quality and cost is essential. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning models often outperform smaller models but at 3--5$\times$ higher cost and added latency. We present entropy-guided refinement: a lightweight, test-time loop that uses token-level uncertainty to trigger a single, targeted refinement pass. We extract logprobs, compute Shannon entropy on top-$k$ alternatives, and apply a simple OR-logic trigger over perplexity, maximum token entropy, and low-confidence-token count. Unlike approaches that use entropy only for measurement or decoding, we pass a compact uncertainty report (tokens, confidences, alternatives, context) back to the model to guide corrective edits. On representative technical queries across reasoning, mathematics, and code generation tasks, a small model with our loop approaches 95\% of a reference reasoning model's quality at approximately one-third of the cost. The method achieves selective refinement on ~31\% of responses while improving accuracy by 16 percentage points over single-pass inference. We demonstrate that this uncertainty-aware loop provides an effective middle ground between single-pass inference and expensive reasoning chains, making it practical for production deployments where both quality and cost matter.

Summary:
- The study explores the impact of varying accuracy in emotion classifiers on social behavior.
- Agents with low-accuracy classifiers exhibit diminished trust, sadness, and disordered social organization.
- Agents with high-accuracy classifiers develop emotional resilience and cohesion.
- Even in emotionally neutral scenarios, misperception leads to segregation and disintegration of cohesion.

arXiv:2509.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability of humans to detect and respond to others' emotions is fundamental to understanding social behavior. Here, agents are instantiated with emotion classifiers of varying accuracy to study the impact of perceptual accuracy on emergent emotional and spatial behavior. Agents are visually represented with face photos from the KDEF database and endowed with one of three classifiers trained on the JAFFE (poor), CK+ (medium), or KDEF (high) datasets. Agents communicate locally on a 2D toroidal lattice, perceiving neighbors' emotional state based on their classifier and responding with movement toward perceived positive emotions and away from perceived negative emotions. Note that the agents respond to perceived, instead of ground-truth, emotions, introducing systematic misperception and frustration. A battery of experiments is carried out on homogeneous and heterogeneous populations and scenarios with repeated emotional shocks. Results show that low-accuracy classifiers on the part of the agent reliably result in diminished trust, emotional disintegration into sadness, and disordered social organization. By contrast, the agent that develops high accuracy develops hardy emotional clusters and resilience to emotional disruptions. Even in emotionally neutral scenarios, misperception is enough to generate segregation and disintegration of cohesion. These findings underscore the fact that biases or imprecision in emotion recognition may significantly warp social processes and disrupt emotional integration.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) take on greater roles in high-stakes decisions, alignment with human values is essential. Reliance on proprietary APIs limits reproducibility and broad participation. We study whether local open-source ensemble debates can improve alignmentoriented reasoning. Across 150 debates spanning 15 scenarios and five ensemble configurations, ensembles outperform single-model baselines on a 7-point rubric (overall: 3.48 vs. 3.13), with the largest gains in reasoning depth (+19.4%) and argument quality (+34.1%). Improvements are strongest for truthfulness (+1.25 points) and human enhancement (+0.80). We provide code, prompts, and a debate data set, providing an accessible and reproducible foundation for ensemble-based alignment evaluation.

<div> MODE, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, lightweight, cluster-and-route retrieval, semantically coherent clusters <br />
<br />Summary: MODE is a lightweight alternative to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for small, domain-specific collections. It replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval, using cached centroids to eliminate the need for large vector databases. By grouping documents into semantically coherent clusters and routing queries to relevant clusters, MODE matches or exceeds dense-retrieval baselines in answer quality while reducing retrieval time. The cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing in MODE allow for controlling the recall/precision trade-off, with tighter clusters leading to improved downstream accuracy. This approach offers a practical solution for small to medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus are important considerations. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) often relies on large vector databases and cross-encoders tuned for large-scale corpora, which can be excessive for small, domain-specific collections. We present MODE (Mixture of Document Experts), a lightweight alternative that replaces fine-grained nearest-neighbor search with cluster-and-route retrieval. Documents are embedded, grouped into semantically coherent clusters, and represented by cached centroids. At query time, we route to the top centroid(s) and retrieve context only within those clusters, eliminating external vector-database infrastructure and reranking while keeping latency low. On HotpotQA and SQuAD corpora with 100-500 chunks, MODE matches or exceeds a dense-retrieval baseline in answer quality while reducing end-to-end retrieval time. Ablations show that cluster granularity and multi-cluster routing control the recall/precision trade-off, and that tighter clusters improve downstream accuracy. MODE offers a practical recipe for small and medium corpora where simplicity, speed, and topical focus matter.

The paper discusses the transition of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) from research to real-world applications and the importance of considering human-centered and economic metrics. It introduces the Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm for normalizing metrics, applying thresholds, and performing anomaly detection. Through simulations and experiments, AMDM significantly reduces anomaly-detection latency and false-positive rates compared to static thresholds. The paper includes a comparison table, ROC/PR curves, and highlights the need for additional metrics in case studies.

arXiv:2509.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) -- multi-agent systems that combine large language models with external tools and autonomous planning -- are rapidly transitioning from research laboratories into high-stakes domains. Our earlier "Basic" paper introduced a five-axis framework and proposed preliminary metrics such as goal drift and harm reduction but did not provide an algorithmic instantiation or empirical evidence. This "Advanced" sequel fills that gap. First, we revisit recent benchmarks and industrial deployments to show that technical metrics still dominate evaluations: a systematic review of 84 papers from 2023--2025 found that 83% report capability metrics while only 30% consider human-centred or economic axes [2]. Second, we formalise an Adaptive Multi-Dimensional Monitoring (AMDM) algorithm that normalises heterogeneous metrics, applies per-axis exponentially weighted moving-average thresholds and performs joint anomaly detection via the Mahalanobis distance. Third, we conduct simulations and real-world experiments. AMDM cuts anomaly-detection latency from 12.3 s to 5.6 s on simulated goal drift and reduces false-positive rates from 4.5% to 0.9% compared with static thresholds. We present a comparison table and ROC/PR curves, and we reanalyse case studies to surface missing metrics. Code, data and a reproducibility checklist accompany this paper to facilitate replication.

<div> reinforcement learning, verifiable feedback, large language models, difficulty aware certainty, exploration

Summary:<br />
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning by providing sparse rewards based on final answer correctness. However, it lacks granular guidance on the reasoning process itself. Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE) addresses this by using LLMs' self-certainty to assess task difficulty and modulate exploration. By penalizing high certainty in difficult tasks and rewarding it in easier tasks, DACE balances exploration-exploitation trade-off effectively. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show DACE outperforms baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust performance with scaled test-time compute. This adaptive approach fosters effective exploration without sacrificing precision.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Feedback (RLVF) has become a key technique for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, its reliance on sparse, outcome based rewards, which only indicate if a final answer is correct or not, fails to provide granular guidance on the reasoning process itself. This limitation hinders efficient learning, as the model cannot distinguish between high quality and inefficient solutions, nor can it learn effectively from different types of failures. To address this, we observe that an LLMs self-certainty often correlates with task difficulty and solution quality. We introduce Difficulty Aware Certainty guided Exploration (DACE), a novel RL algorithm that leverages this insight to dynamically balance the exploration exploitation trade-off. DACE assesses task difficulty online based on the policys success rate. It then uses this signal to modulate an intrinsic reward: for difficult tasks where the model is struggling, DACE encourages exploration by penalizing high certainty; for easier tasks, it encourages learning efficiency by rewarding high certainty. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AIME, MATH) show that DACE significantly outperforms strong baselines. The DACE-trained models not only achieve higher accuracy but also demonstrate more robust performance when scaling test-time compute, validating that our adaptive approach fosters effective exploration without sacrificing precision.

<div> Health Access Resource Planner, Ethiopia, Universal Health Coverage, optimization framework, health system strengthening 

Summary: 
The Ministry of Health in Ethiopia is working towards expanding access to essential healthcare services by strengthening health posts. Due to limited budgets and competing priorities, only a fraction of this effort can be implemented each year. To address this, a tool called Health Access Resource Planner (HARP) has been developed to guide prioritization across Ethiopia's regions. HARP is based on a decision-support optimization framework that aims to maximize population coverage under budget uncertainty while meeting region-specific proportionality targets at each step. Two algorithms have been proposed to aid in facility planning: a learning-augmented approach to improve expert recommendations and a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with strong worst-case approximation estimation. Through collaboration with Ethiopian Public Health Institute and the Ministry of Health, the efficacy of the method has been demonstrated in three regions across various planning scenarios. <div>

Abstract: As part of nationwide efforts aligned with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 on Universal Health Coverage, Ethiopia's Ministry of Health is strengthening health posts to expand access to essential healthcare services. However, only a fraction of this health system strengthening effort can be implemented each year due to limited budgets and other competing priorities, thus the need for an optimization framework to guide prioritization across the regions of Ethiopia. In this paper, we develop a tool, Health Access Resource Planner (HARP), based on a principled decision-support optimization framework for sequential facility planning that aims to maximize population coverage under budget uncertainty while satisfying region-specific proportionality targets at every time step. We then propose two algorithms: (i) a learning-augmented approach that improves upon expert recommendations at any single-step; and (ii) a greedy algorithm for multi-step planning, both with strong worst-case approximation estimation. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we demonstrated the empirical efficacy of our method on three regions across various planning scenarios.

Summary:
The study focuses on expanding the topological semantics of evidence-based belief and knowledge to encompass groups within multi-agent models. The logic of group evidence, knowledge, and belief is completely axiomatized and shown to be decidable. A specific fragment, the logic of group knowledge and belief, is also thoroughly explored. The extension of languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators is fully axiomatized, demonstrating co-expressiveness with their static bases.

Abstract: We study notions of (virtual) group knowledge and group belief within multi-agent evidence models, obtained by extending the topological semantics of evidence-based belief and fallible knowledge from individuals to groups. We completely axiomatize and show the decidability of the logic of ("hard" and "soft") group evidence, and do the same for an especially interesting fragment of it: the logic of group knowledge and group belief. We also extend these languages with dynamic evidence-sharing operators, and completely axiomatize the corresponding logics, showing that they are co-expressive with their static bases.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous agents, Artificial General Intelligence, Hierarchical Variable Agent, Semantic-Topological Evolution, Task execution.

Summary:
Autonomous agents are essential for advancing Artificial General Intelligence by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for problem-solving. However, current paradigms face a trade-off between fixed workflows and flexible reactive loops. To address this, the Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA) framework models workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution algorithm. This optimization process utilizes textual gradients as surrogates for backpropagation, enhancing task accuracy and resource efficiency in various benchmarks. HiVA's iterative approach includes Multi-Armed Bandit-based routing, diagnostic gradient generation, and coordinated updates for collective optimization in unknown environments. Experimental results demonstrate a 5-10% improvement in task accuracy, showcasing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

3. Textual gradients are used for backpropagation, enhancing task accuracy and resource efficiency.

Abstract: Autonomous agents play a crucial role in advancing Artificial General Intelligence, enabling problem decomposition and tool orchestration through Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing paradigms face a critical trade-off. On one hand, reusable fixed workflows require manual reconfiguration upon environmental changes; on the other hand, flexible reactive loops fail to distill reasoning progress into transferable structures. We introduce Hierarchical Variable Agent (HiVA), a novel framework modeling agentic workflows as self-organized graphs with the Semantic-Topological Evolution (STEV) algorithm, which optimizes hybrid semantic-topological spaces using textual gradients as discrete-domain surrogates for backpropagation. The iterative process comprises Multi-Armed Bandit-infused forward routing, diagnostic gradient generation from environmental feedback, and coordinated updates that co-evolve individual semantics and topology for collective optimization in unknown environments. Experiments on dialogue, coding, Long-context Q&amp;A, mathematical, and agentic benchmarks demonstrate improvements of 5-10% in task accuracy and enhanced resource efficiency over existing baselines, establishing HiVA's effectiveness in autonomous task execution.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, Instruction-Level Weight Shaping, Reflection Engine, Enterprise support, Autonomous updates

Summary:
Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS) is introduced as a method to improve large language models (LLMs) by using curated system instructions to update pseudo-parameters based on user feedback and reflection. The Reflection Engine diagnoses reasoning successes and failures, proposing changes to instructions, user preferences, and tools. These changes are evaluated and controlled through version control mechanisms. ILWS aims to enhance throughput and reduce errors in enterprise support contexts. It has shown significant improvements in ticket resolution efficiency and accuracy. ILWS enables autonomous updates and tool synthesis, making it adaptable to various dynamic domains like legal, medical, and engineering. By operating at the instruction layer until controlled distillation, ILWS offers a practical solution for integrating new knowledge and improving reasoning capabilities in LLMs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are fluent but largely static after pre-training; new or shifting knowledge is typically added with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) or fine-tuning. RAG raises latency and engineering overhead and often fails to integrate facts; prompt engineering is brittle and can conflict with prior knowledge; fine-tuning is costly and risks catastrophic forgetting. We propose Instruction-Level Weight Shaping (ILWS): curated system instructions act as external, auditable pseudo-parameters updated after each session via reflection and user feedback. A Reflection Engine inspects conversation traces, diagnoses reasoning successes and failures, and proposes typed deltas $\Delta K=(\Delta S,\Delta U,\Delta T)$ over instructions, user preferences, and tools. Deltas are version-controlled, evaluated with a sliding window of 1-5 star ratings, auto-repaired on first failure, and rolled back on repeated failure. When an edit budget crosses a threshold, the agent compiles a rating-weighted synthetic set and distills matured instruction-space gains into parameters, converting prompt-space improvements into weight-space without downtime. ILWS makes explicit the low-rank shaping induced by context in transformer blocks, preserves governance, and removes per-call retrieval. In enterprise support it increased throughput 2.4-5.0x and cut audited hallucinations by about 80% versus a frozen baseline. In an Adobe Commerce Cloud proof of concept "L0 Support", it achieved 4-5x more tickets per hour and about 80% lower time per ticket, with autonomous instruction updates and optional tool synthesis. Because ILWS operates at the instruction layer until controlled distillation, it generalizes to dynamic domains (legal, medical, engineering) requiring adaptive reasoning, tool creation, and low-latency deployment.

<div> Framework, Large Language Models, State Machines, Control, Performance
Summary:
SHERPA is a model-driven framework designed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dealing with complex tasks by integrating domain-specific best practices into hierarchical state machines. By utilizing state machines, SHERPA enables more precise control over LLM behavior through machine learning-driven decisions and rules. The framework proves effective in tasks such as code and class name generation, as well as question answering, surpassing previous approaches in performance. The study showcases the benefits of incorporating well-designed state machines, particularly in tasks that rely on established human best practices but lack sufficient training data for LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating state machines significantly enhances the quality of LLM outputs, indicating the potential of SHERPA in improving LLM capabilities for challenging tasks. 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved widespread application across various fields. Despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs suffer from a lack of structured reasoning ability, particularly for complex tasks requiring domain-specific best practices, which are often unavailable in the training data. Although multi-step prompting methods incorporating human best practices, such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought, have gained popularity, they lack a general mechanism to control LLM behavior. In this paper, we propose SHERPA, a model-driven framework to improve the LLM performance on complex tasks by explicitly incorporating domain-specific best practices into hierarchical state machines. By structuring the LLM execution processes using state machines, SHERPA enables more fine-grained control over their behavior via rules or decisions driven by machine learning-based approaches, including LLMs. We show that SHERPA is applicable to a wide variety of tasks-specifically, code generation, class name generation, and question answering-replicating previously proposed approaches while further improving the performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SHERPA for the aforementioned tasks using various LLMs. Our systematic evaluation compares different state machine configurations against baseline approaches without state machines. Results show that integrating well-designed state machines significantly improves the quality of LLM outputs, and is particularly beneficial for complex tasks with well-established human best practices but lacking data used for training LLMs.

<div> Keywords: multimodal data, urban spaces, knowledge graphs, incidents, Large Language Models (LLMs)

Summary:
SIGMUS is a system designed for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban Spaces. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify relationships between incidents happening in urban areas and data from various sources. This allows for the organization of evidence and observations relevant to incidents without the need for human-encoded rules. The system creates a knowledge graph to represent organized knowledge about incidents, observations, and more in urban spaces. By analyzing data from sources such as news articles, CCTV images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements, SIGMUS can establish connections between different data sources and incidents occurring simultaneously at the same location. The system shows promise in bridging the gap between fragmented multimodal data sources and effectively integrating them to understand and predict events in urban landscapes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern urban spaces are equipped with an increasingly diverse set of sensors, all producing an abundance of multimodal data. Such multimodal data can be used to identify and reason about important incidents occurring in urban landscapes, such as major emergencies, cultural and social events, as well as natural disasters. However, such data may be fragmented over several sources and difficult to integrate due to the reliance on human-driven reasoning for identifying relationships between the multimodal data corresponding to an incident, as well as understanding the different components which define an incident. Such relationships and components are critical to identifying the causes of such incidents, as well as producing forecasting the scale and intensity of future incidents as they begin to develop. In this work, we create SIGMUS, a system for Semantic Integration for Knowledge Graphs in Multimodal Urban Spaces. SIGMUS uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce the necessary world knowledge for identifying relationships between incidents occurring in urban spaces and data from different modalities, allowing us to organize evidence and observations relevant to an incident without relying and human-encoded rules for relating multimodal sensory data with incidents. This organized knowledge is represented as a knowledge graph, organizing incidents, observations, and much more. We find that our system is able to produce reasonable connections between 5 different data sources (new article text, CCTV images, air quality, weather, and traffic measurements) and relevant incidents occurring at the same time and location.

Recent advances in autonomous digital agents have shown potential in structured tasks like decision-making and task decomposition in industries like journalism. The NEWSAGENT benchmark evaluates how agents can search, select, and edit multimodal web data to create news articles, reflecting real-world challenges in news writing. Agents must identify narrative perspectives, issue queries, retrieve background information, and integrate facts to generate complete articles. While agents can retrieve relevant information, they struggle with planning and narrative cohesion. NEWSAGENT provides a realistic testbed for evaluating agent performance in manipulating multimodal web data for real-world productivity. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous digital agents from industry (e.g., Manus AI and Gemini's research mode) highlight potential for structured tasks by autonomous decision-making and task decomposition; however, it remains unclear to what extent the agent-based systems can improve multimodal web data productivity. We study this in the realm of journalism, which requires iterative planning, interpretation, and contextual reasoning from multimodal raw contents to form a well structured news. We introduce NEWSAGENT, a benchmark for evaluating how agents can automatically search available raw contents, select desired information, and edit and rephrase to form a news article by accessing core journalistic functions. Given a writing instruction and firsthand data as how a journalist initiates a news draft, agents are tasked to identify narrative perspectives, issue keyword-based queries, retrieve historical background, and generate complete articles. Unlike typical summarization or retrieval tasks, essential context is not directly available and must be actively discovered, reflecting the information gaps faced in real-world news writing. NEWSAGENT includes 6k human-verified examples derived from real news, with multimodal contents converted to text for broad model compatibility. We evaluate open- and closed-sourced LLMs with commonly-used agentic frameworks on NEWSAGENT, which shows that agents are capable of retrieving relevant facts but struggling with planning and narrative integration. We believe that NEWSAGENT serves a realistic testbed for iterating and evaluating agent capabilities in terms of multimodal web data manipulation to real-world productivity.

<div> Keywords: ice cream, stabilizers, melting behavior, foam-like structure, cost-effective

Summary: 
The study examines the impact of different stabilizers, including locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and carrageenan, on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. Through melting tests and timelapse recordings, it was found that all samples maintained a foam-like structure after melting, indicating the stabilizers contributed to a stable air-cell matrix. Additionally, re-freezing and re-melting the samples showed increased sturdiness, suggesting improved structural resilience. Comparative analysis revealed varying effectiveness among stabilizers, with some providing stronger melting resistance and structural support. The study highlights the potential for developing cost-effective ice cream recipes that balance durability and economic efficiency, offering practical applications for both small-scale and commercial production.

Abstract: The stability of ice cream during melting is a critical factor for consumer's acceptance and product quality. With the commonly added stabilizer to improve texture, structure and slower melting as the factors to analyze. This report explores the effects of locust bean gum, guar gum, maltodextrin, and carrageenan on the melting behavior of homemade ice cream. The main objective was to assess how these additives influence melting resistance and to identify a more cost-effective recipe formulation. Ice cream samples incorporating each additive were prepared and subjected to melting tests under controlled conditions. Timelapse recordings were used to capture and analyze the progression of melting over time. Python and OpenCV is used for process and analysis. Observations revealed that all samples retained a foam-like structure even after melting, suggesting the stabilizers contributed to the formation of a stable air-cell matrix. Furthermore, when the melted samples were re-frozen and subsequently melted again, they displayed increased sturdiness, indicating improved resilience of the ice cream structure. Comparative analysis of the different stabilizers highlighted variations in their effectiveness, with some offering stronger melting resistance and structural support than others. Overall, the findings provide insights into the functional roles of commonly used food additives in ice cream formulation. By evaluating both performance and cost, this study demonstrates the potential for developing recipes that balance durability with economic efficiency, contributing to practical applications in both small-scale and commercial ice cream production.

<div> Keywords: SuperBrain, collective intelligence, large language models, co-evolution, Swarm Intelligence

Summary: 
The proposed SuperBrain framework focuses on the collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and human users, aiming to create a collective intelligence system. This dynamic approach involves the evolution from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain through personalized interactions, adaptive learning memory, and GA-assisted evolution. Subclass Brains are formed through persistent user-LLM interactions, refining prompts and task performance. These Subclass Brains then coordinate via Swarm Intelligence to optimize across various tasks and exchange heuristics. The behaviors and cognitive signatures of multiple Subclass Brains integrate into a Superclass Brain, which possesses meta-intelligence capabilities such as abstraction, generalization, and self-improvement. Initial implementations include UAV scheduling and keyword filtering tasks. The proposed registry enables cross-dyad knowledge consolidation. This work lays the foundation for scalable, explainable, and ethically aligned collective AI systems.Summary: <div>

Abstract: We propose a novel SuperBrain framework for collective intelligence, grounded in the co-evolution of large language models (LLMs) and human users. Unlike static prompt engineering or isolated agent simulations, our approach emphasizes a dynamic pathway from Subclass Brain to Superclass Brain: (1) A Subclass Brain arises from persistent, personalized interaction between a user and an LLM, forming a cognitive dyad with adaptive learning memory. (2) Through GA-assisted forward-backward evolution, these dyads iteratively refine prompts and task performance. (3) Multiple Subclass Brains coordinate via Swarm Intelligence, optimizing across multi-objective fitness landscapes and exchanging distilled heuristics. (4) Their standardized behaviors and cognitive signatures integrate into a Superclass Brain, an emergent meta-intelligence capable of abstraction, generalization and self-improvement. We outline the theoretical constructs, present initial implementations (e.g., UAV scheduling, KU/KI keyword filtering) and propose a registry for cross-dyad knowledge consolidation. This work provides both a conceptual foundation and an architectural roadmap toward scalable, explainable and ethically aligned collective AI.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP) aimed at helping AI systems better understand and reason about social dynamics. Based on a POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples, enabling automatic induction from free-form narratives. The study demonstrates that S3AP can enhance Language Models' (LLMs) understanding of social narratives and improve performance on social reasoning tasks, outperforming existing benchmarks. Furthermore, the induced social world models from these structured representations prove effective in predicting future social dynamics and enhancing agent decision-making processes. The findings highlight the potential of S3AP as a versatile representation for social world states, enabling the development of more socially-aware AI systems that can navigate social interactions more effectively.

Abstract: Humans intuitively navigate social interactions by simulating unspoken dynamics and reasoning about others' perspectives, even with limited information. In contrast, AI systems struggle to automatically structure and reason about these implicit social contexts. In this paper, we introduce a novel structured social world representation formalism (S3AP), designed to help AI systems reason more effectively about social dynamics. Following a POMDP-driven design, S3AP represents social interactions as structured tuples, such as state, observation, agent actions, and mental states, which can be automatically induced from free-form narratives or other inputs. We first show S3AP can help LLMs better understand social narratives across 5 social reasoning tasks (e.g., +51% improvement on FANToM's theory-of-mind reasoning with OpenAI's o1), reaching new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We then induce social world models from these structured representations, demonstrating their ability to predict future social dynamics and improve agent decision-making, yielding up to +18% improvement on the SOTOPIA social interaction benchmark. Our findings highlight the promise of S3AP as a powerful, general-purpose representation for social world states, enabling the development of more socially-aware systems that better navigate social interactions.

<div> Keywords: time series forecasting, multimodal architectures, large language models, balance, alignment

Summary:
BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting) addresses the issue of imbalance between text and temporal data in forecasting by introducing a lightweight framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. It processes raw time series data with a time series encoder and generates textual embeddings using descriptive statistics with a learnable prompt in a large language model (LLM). A scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective ensures balanced cross-modal context alignment between the time series and textual embeddings. The aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are then integrated for forecasting. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-term and few-shot forecasting with minimal trainable parameters. The framework effectively harnesses complementary information from text and time series data. Code for BALM-TSF is available on GitHub for further exploration and use.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is a long-standing and highly challenging research topic. Recently, driven by the rise of large language models (LLMs), research has increasingly shifted from purely time series methods toward harnessing textual modalities to enhance forecasting performance. However, the vast discrepancy between text and temporal data often leads current multimodal architectures to over-emphasise one modality while neglecting the other, resulting in information loss that harms forecasting performance. To address this modality imbalance, we introduce BALM-TSF (Balanced Multimodal Alignment for LLM-Based Time Series Forecasting), a lightweight time series forecasting framework that maintains balance between the two modalities. Specifically, raw time series are processed by the time series encoder, while descriptive statistics of raw time series are fed to an LLM with learnable prompt, producing compact textual embeddings. To ensure balanced cross-modal context alignment of time series and textual embeddings, a simple yet effective scaling strategy combined with a contrastive objective then maps these textual embeddings into the latent space of the time series embeddings. Finally, the aligned textual semantic embeddings and time series embeddings are together integrated for forecasting. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that, with minimal trainable parameters, BALM-TSF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both long-term and few-shot forecasting, confirming its ability to harness complementary information from text and time series.

Abstract: We present NetGent, an AI-agent framework for automating complex application workflows to generate realistic network traffic datasets. Developing generalizable ML models for networking requires data collection from network environments with traffic that results from a diverse set of real-world web applications. However, using existing browser automation tools that are diverse, repeatable, realistic, and efficient remains fragile and costly. NetGent addresses this challenge by allowing users to specify workflows as natural-language rules that define state-dependent actions. These abstract specifications are compiled into nondeterministic finite automata (NFAs), which a state synthesis component translates into reusable, executable code. This design enables deterministic replay, reduces redundant LLM calls through state caching, and adapts quickly when application interfaces change. In experiments, NetGent automated more than 50+ workflows spanning video-on-demand streaming, live video streaming, video conferencing, social media, and web scraping, producing realistic traffic traces while remaining robust to UI variability. By combining the flexibility of language-based agents with the reliability of compiled execution, NetGent provides a scalable foundation for generating the diverse, repeatable datasets needed to advance ML in networking.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework for legal reasoning, dividing the process into knowledge acquisition and application stages. Specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules to create intermediate representations of statutes. The framework then applies this knowledge to specific cases through analyzing queries, performing symbolic inference, and generating final answers. The approach combines natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning, enhancing transparency. Evaluation on tax calculation tasks showed foundational models achieving 76.4% accuracy, narrowing the performance gap. This suggests that modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make legal reasoning more accessible and enhance consistency and explainability in AI systems. The study lays a foundation for future research on transparent, trustworthy, and effective AI systems for the legal domain. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes. The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps: analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points, significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches. Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to 18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and effective AI systems for legal domain.

Summary:<br />
Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks involving audio-video understanding. However, they still suffer from hallucination issues, where text cues dominate and neglect visual and audio information. The OmniDPO framework aims to address these challenges by enhancing the model's understanding of audio-video interactions through text-preference sample pairs and strengthening attention to visual and auditory information through multimodal-preference sample pairs. By tackling these challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding and reduces hallucination in OLLMs. Experiments show that OmniDPO not only mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also enhances reasoning capabilities across modalities. The code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Recently, Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) have sparked a new wave of research, achieving impressive results in tasks such as audio-video understanding and real-time environment perception. However, hallucination issues still persist. Similar to the bimodal setting, the priors from the text modality tend to dominate, leading OLLMs to rely more heavily on textual cues while neglecting visual and audio information. In addition, fully multimodal scenarios introduce new challenges. Most existing models align visual or auditory modalities with text independently during training, while ignoring the intrinsic correlations between video and its corresponding audio. This oversight results in hallucinations when reasoning requires interpreting hidden audio cues embedded in video content. To address these challenges, we propose OmniDPO, a preference-alignment framework designed to mitigate hallucinations in OLLMs. Specifically, OmniDPO incorporates two strategies: (1) constructing text-preference sample pairs to enhance the model's understanding of audio-video interactions; and (2) constructing multimodal-preference sample pairs to strengthen the model's attention to visual and auditory information. By tackling both challenges, OmniDPO effectively improves multimodal grounding and reduces hallucination. Experiments conducted on two OLLMs demonstrate that OmniDPO not only effectively mitigates multimodal hallucinations but also significantly enhances the models' reasoning capabilities across modalities. All code and datasets will be released upon paper acceptance.

This approach eliminates the need for fine-tuning, making it cost-effective and efficient. Some graph reasoning tasks remain challenging for LLMs without mappings to grounded representations, but injecting structured context helps align tasks with conceptual spaces.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in solving problems across domains, including graph-related tasks traditionally addressed by symbolic or algorithmic methods. In this work, we present a framework for structured context injection, where task-specific information is systematically embedded in the input to guide LLMs in solving a wide range of graph problems. Our method does not require fine-tuning of LLMs, making it cost-efficient and lightweight. We observe that certain graph reasoning tasks remain challenging for LLMs unless they are mapped to conceptually grounded representations. However, achieving such mappings through fine-tuning or repeated multi-step querying can be expensive and inefficient. Our approach offers a practical alternative by injecting structured context directly into the input, enabling the LLM to implicitly align the task with grounded conceptual spaces. We evaluate the approach on multiple graph tasks using both lightweight and large models, highlighting the trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost. The results demonstrate consistent performance improvements, showing that structured input context can rival or surpass more complex approaches. Our findings underscore the value of structured context injection as an effective and scalable strategy for graph understanding with LLMs.

Summary:
L-MARS is a system designed to enhance legal question answering by combining multi-agent reasoning and agentic search techniques. It breaks down queries into subproblems, conducts targeted searches across various sources, and employs a Judge Agent for verification before answer synthesis. This iterative process helps reduce hallucination and uncertainty, ensuring coherence in answers. The system was evaluated on LegalSearchQA, a benchmark of 200 legal questions updated in 2025, and showed significant improvements in factual accuracy and reduced uncertainty. It received higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges. The study highlights the effectiveness of multi-agent reasoning and agentic search for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains that require precise legal retrieval and deliberation.

<br /><br />Summary: 
1. L-MARS enhances legal question answering through multi-agent reasoning and agentic search.
2. Queries are decomposed into subproblems for targeted searches across heterogeneous sources.
3. A Judge Agent verifies sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis.
4. The system reduces hallucination and uncertainty, ensuring coherence in answers.
5. L-MARS improves factual accuracy and receives higher preference scores in legal question answering evaluations. <div>

Abstract: We present L-MARS (Legal Multi-Agent Workflow with Orchestrated Reasoning and Agentic Search), a system that reduces hallucination and uncertainty in legal question answering through coordinated multi-agent reasoning and retrieval. Unlike single-pass retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), L-MARS decomposes queries into subproblems, issues targeted searches across heterogeneous sources (Serper web, local RAG, CourtListener case law), and employs a Judge Agent to verify sufficiency, jurisdiction, and temporal validity before answer synthesis. This iterative reasoning-search-verification loop maintains coherence, filters noisy evidence, and grounds answers in authoritative law. We evaluated L-MARS on LegalSearchQA, a new benchmark of 200 up-to-date multiple choice legal questions in 2025. Results show that L-MARS substantially improves factual accuracy, reduces uncertainty, and achieves higher preference scores from both human experts and LLM-based judges. Our work demonstrates that multi-agent reasoning with agentic search offers a scalable and reproducible blueprint for deploying LLMs in high-stakes domains requiring precise legal retrieval and deliberation.

Summary:
Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS) is introduced to improve the accuracy and calibration of large reasoning models (LRMs) for AI-driven materials discovery. The method favors reasoning traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, reducing physics-violation rates while lowering sampling cost. By selecting traces based on domain-aware constraints and physics adherence, the framework enhances the reliability and efficiency of LRMs in process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design. This approach demonstrates the potential of combining modest constraints with trace-level selection to create more effective and practical models for automated experimentation and algorithmic decision-making in materials science. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

<div> Keywords: Sharpe ratio, Markov decision processes, dynamic programming, risk metrics, optimization<br />
Summary: 
The paper discusses the optimization of the Sharpe ratio in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, addressing challenges related to fractional objectives and risk metrics. By using Dinkelbach's transform, the Sharpe ratio objective is converted to a mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective, allowing for efficient optimization. An iterative algorithm is developed for M2V optimization, similar to mean-variance optimization in MDPs, with a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived that converges to the optimal value. Policy iteration procedures are developed for both average and discounted MDP settings, ensuring convergence to the optimum solution. Numerical experiments validate the proposed approach, which represents a novel method for solving Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs using dynamic programming algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2509.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharpe ratio (also known as reward-to-variability ratio) is a widely-used metric in finance, which measures the additional return at the cost of per unit of increased risk (standard deviation of return). However, the optimization of Sharpe ratio in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is challenging, because there exist two difficulties hindering the application of dynamic programming. One is that dynamic programming does not work for fractional objectives, and the other is that dynamic programming is invalid for risk metrics. In this paper, we study the Sharpe ratio optimization in infinite-horizon MDPs, considering both the long-run average and discounted settings. We address the first challenge with the Dinkelbachs transform, which converts the Sharpe ratio objective to a mean-squared-variance (M2V) objective. It is shown that the M2V optimization and the original Sharpe ratio optimization share the same optimal policy when the risk-sensitive parameter is equal to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For the second challenge, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the M2V optimization which is similar to a mean-variance optimization in MDPs. We iteratively solve the M2V problem and obtain the associated Sharpe ratio that is used to update the risk-sensitive parameter in the next iteration of M2V problems. We show that such a sequence of Sharpe ratios derived is monotonically increasing and converges to the optimal Sharpe ratio. For both average and discounted MDP settings, we develop a policy iteration procedure and prove its convergence to the optimum. Numerical experiments are conducted for validation. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first that solves the Sharpe ratio optimization in MDPs with dynamic programming type algorithms. We believe that the proposed algorithm can shed light on solving MDPs with other fractional objectives.

Summary: This paper introduces a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring approach to address suffix prediction in Business Process Management by integrating data-driven learning with temporal logic-based prior knowledge. Existing deep learning models for suffix prediction often lack logical constraints due to the absence of domain knowledge integration. The proposed method incorporates Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces into autoregressive sequence predictors during training, utilizing a differentiable logical loss function. This approach improves suffix prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints, as demonstrated on real-world datasets. Two variants of the logic loss (local and global) are introduced and shown to be effective in noisy and realistic settings. While developed for BPM, the framework is adaptable to any symbolic sequence generation task, contributing to the advancement of Neuro-Symbolic AI.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of suffix prediction in Business Process Management (BPM) by proposing a Neuro-Symbolic Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) approach that integrates data-driven learning with temporal logic-based prior knowledge. While recent approaches leverage deep learning models for suffix prediction, they often fail to satisfy even basic logical constraints due to the absence of explicit integration of domain knowledge during training. We propose a novel method to incorporate Linear Temporal Logic over finite traces (LTLf) into the training process of autoregressive sequence predictors. Our approach introduces a differentiable logical loss function, defined using a soft approximation of LTLf semantics and the Gumbel-Softmax trick, which can be combined with standard predictive losses. This ensures the model learns to generate suffixes that are both accurate and logically consistent. Experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets shows that our method improves suffix prediction accuracy and compliance with temporal constraints. We also introduce two variants of the logic loss (local and global) and demonstrate their effectiveness under noisy and realistic settings. While developed in the context of BPM, our framework is applicable to any symbolic sequence generation task and contributes toward advancing Neuro-Symbolic AI.

Summary: 
ChatCLIDS is a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change, specifically focusing on the adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems in type 1 diabetes patients. The framework includes a library of virtual patients with diverse profiles and adoption barriers, allowing for multi-turn interactions with nurse agents using evidence-based persuasive strategies. The study found that while larger and more reflective LLMs can adapt strategies over time, they struggle to overcome resistance, particularly in the face of realistic social pressure. These results emphasize the limitations of current LLMs for behavior change and highlight the need for trustworthy persuasive AI in healthcare and other domains. ChatCLIDS provides a high-fidelity and scalable testbed for advancing research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Real-world adoption of closed-loop insulin delivery systems (CLIDS) in type 1 diabetes remains low, driven not by technical failure, but by diverse behavioral, psychosocial, and social barriers. We introduce ChatCLIDS, the first benchmark to rigorously evaluate LLM-driven persuasive dialogue for health behavior change. Our framework features a library of expert-validated virtual patients, each with clinically grounded, heterogeneous profiles and realistic adoption barriers, and simulates multi-turn interactions with nurse agents equipped with a diverse set of evidence-based persuasive strategies. ChatCLIDS uniquely supports longitudinal counseling and adversarial social influence scenarios, enabling robust, multi-dimensional evaluation. Our findings reveal that while larger and more reflective LLMs adapt strategies over time, all models struggle to overcome resistance, especially under realistic social pressure.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR) has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm for solving extensive-form games, but its integration with deep neural networks introduces scale-dependent challenges that manifest differently across game complexities. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of how neural MCCFR component effectiveness varies with game scale and proposes an adaptive framework for selective component deployment. We identify that theoretical risks such as nonstationary target distribution shifts, action support collapse, variance explosion, and warm-starting bias have scale-dependent manifestation patterns, requiring different mitigation strategies for small versus large games. Our proposed Robust Deep MCCFR framework incorporates target networks with delayed updates, uniform exploration mixing, variance-aware training objectives, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring. Through systematic ablation studies on Kuhn and Leduc Poker, we demonstrate scale-dependent component effectiveness and identify critical component interactions. The best configuration achieves final exploitability of 0.0628 on Kuhn Poker, representing a 60% improvement over the classical framework (0.156). On the more complex Leduc Poker domain, selective component usage achieves exploitability of 0.2386, a 23.5% improvement over the classical framework (0.3703) and highlighting the importance of careful component selection over comprehensive mitigation. Our contributions include: (1) a formal theoretical analysis of risks in neural MCCFR, (2) a principled mitigation framework with convergence guarantees, (3) comprehensive multi-scale experimental validation revealing scale-dependent component interactions, and (4) practical guidelines for deployment in larger games.

arXiv:2509.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable general reasoning capabilities. However, systematically evaluating and enhancing these reasoning capabilities is challenging due to the lack of controllable and scalable tools for fine-grained analysis. Existing benchmarks and datasets often lack the necessary variable control for multi-dimensional, systematic analysis and training, or have narrow problem types and formats. To address these limitations, we introduce SATQuest, a systematic verifier designed to evaluate and enhance logical reasoning in LLMs by generating diverse, Satisfiability-based logical reasoning problems directly from Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) instances. SATQuest structures these problems along three orthogonal dimensions: instance scale, problem type, and question format, employing randomized, SAT-based problem generation and objective answer verification via PySAT. This design mitigates memorization issues, allows for nuanced insights into reasoning performance, and enables effective reinforcement fine-tuning. Our extensive evaluation of various LLMs using SATQuest identified significant limitations in their logical reasoning, particularly in generalizing beyond familiar mathematical formats. Furthermore, we show that reinforcement fine-tuning with SATQuest rewards substantially improves targeted task performance and generalizes to more complex instances, while highlighting remaining challenges in cross-format adaptation. Through these demonstrations, we showcase SATQuest's potential as a foundational tool and a valuable starting point for advancing LLM logical reasoning.

Abstract: Cities today generate enormous streams of data from sensors, cameras, and connected infrastructure. While this information offers unprecedented opportunities to improve urban life, most existing systems struggle with scale, latency, and fragmented insights. This work introduces a framework that blends physics-informed machine learning, multimodal data fusion, and knowledge graph representation with adaptive, rule-based intelligence powered by large language models (LLMs). Physics-informed methods ground learning in real-world constraints, ensuring predictions remain meaningful and consistent with physical dynamics. Knowledge graphs act as the semantic backbone, integrating heterogeneous sensor data into a connected, queryable structure. At the edge, LLMs generate context-aware rules that adapt filtering and decision-making in real time, enabling efficient operation even under constrained resources. Together, these elements form a foundation for digital twin systems that go beyond passive monitoring to provide actionable insights. By uniting physics-based reasoning, semantic data fusion, and adaptive rule generation, this approach opens new possibilities for creating responsive, trustworthy, and sustainable smart infrastructures.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, multi stage hybrid intelligence framework for pruning patent portfolios to identify high value assets for technology transfer. Current patent valuation methods often rely on retrospective indicators or manual, time intensive analysis. Our framework automates and deepens this process by combining a Learning to Rank (LTR) model, which evaluates patents against over 30 legal and commercial parameters, with a unique "Need-Seed" agent-based system. The "Need Agent" uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to mine unstructured market and industry data, identifying explicit technological needs. Concurrently, the "Seed Agent" employs fine tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze patent claims and map their technological capabilities. The system generates a "Core Ontology Framework" that matches high potential patents (Seeds) to documented market demands (Needs), providing a strategic rationale for divestment decisions. We detail the architecture, including a dynamic parameter weighting system and a crucial Human in the-Loop (HITL) validation protocol, to ensure both adaptability and real-world credibility.

<div> Neuro-symbolic, Program synthesis, Large language models, Explanation generation, Human learning experiment <br />
Summary: <br />
Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) aims to improve machine performance and enhance human learning. LENS is introduced as a neuro-symbolic method that automates the explanation of machine-learned logic programs using large language models (LLMs). This approach outperforms hand-crafted templates and direct LLM prompting in generating explanations. However, in a human learning experiment across various domains, LENS did not significantly improve human performance, indicating that comprehensive LLM responses may be overwhelming for simpler problems. While LENS shows promise in automating explanation generation, its effectiveness in supporting human learning needs further investigation. Overall, this work presents a promising framework for developing efficient USML systems that can enhance both machine performance and human learning. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Ultra Strong Machine Learning (USML) refers to symbolic learning systems that not only improve their own performance but can also teach their acquired knowledge to quantifiably improve human performance. In this work, we present LENS (Logic Programming Explanation via Neural Summarisation), a neuro-symbolic method that combines symbolic program synthesis with large language models (LLMs) to automate the explanation of machine-learned logic programs in natural language. LENS addresses a key limitation of prior USML approaches by replacing hand-crafted explanation templates with scalable automated generation. Through systematic evaluation using multiple LLM judges and human validation, we demonstrate that LENS generates superior explanations compared to direct LLM prompting and hand-crafted templates. To investigate whether LENS can teach transferable active learning strategies, we carried out a human learning experiment across three related domains. Our results show no significant human performance improvements, suggesting that comprehensive LLM responses may overwhelm users for simpler problems rather than providing learning support. Our work provides a solid foundation for building effective USML systems to support human learning. The source code is available on: https://github.com/lun-ai/LENS.git.

arXiv:2509.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CoreThink, a state-of-the-art Reasoning Layer built upon a novel reasoning method called General Symbolics. This approach diverges from reasoning paradigms such as test-time scaling, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). CoreThink General Symbolic Reasoner (GSR) is specifically structured around three key use cases: tool-calling, code generation, and planning, demonstrating exemplary performance across a total of seven benchmarks in their respective areas. Notably, we are achieving SOTA scores of 66.66\% on Livecodebench v6, 89\% on Instruction-Following Evals, and 24.4\% on ARC-AGI-2. We also present an agentic coding IDE, developed using the principles of General Symbolics, which achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 62.3\% on \texttt{SWE-Bench Lite}. We are able to achieve these improvements without any finetuning or training costs. Our Reasoning Layer is designed to provide a pure performance uplift, ensuring that a model's accuracy on reasoning tasks is never negatively impacted. We argue that incumbent methods will eventually lead to diminishing returns in LLM performance, necessitating the development of new reasoning techniques. This technical report details our approach at a high level and the availability of the CoreThink models for reasoning-intensive use cases.

Summary:
The paper introduces ReaL-TG, a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) for explainable link forecasting on real-world temporal graphs. It uses outcome-based reward to encourage self-exploration of reasoning strategies and produce explanations for predictions. A new evaluation protocol combines ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system to assess reasoning quality and hallucination impact. Experiments show that ReaL-TG-4B outperforms larger LLMs like GPT-5 mini on ranking metrics and provides high-quality explanations validated by both LLM and human evaluation. <div>
arXiv:2509.00975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecasting future links is a central task in temporal graph (TG) reasoning, requiring models to leverage historical interactions to predict upcoming ones. Traditional neural approaches, such as temporal graph neural networks, achieve strong performance but lack explainability and cannot be applied to unseen graphs without retraining. Recent studies have begun to explore using large language models (LLMs) for graph reasoning, but most of them are constrained to static graphs or small synthetic TGs and lack the evaluation of the quality of reasoning traces generated by LLMs. In this work, we present Reasoning-Enhanced Learning for Temporal Graphs (ReaL-TG), a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes LLMs to perform explainable link forecasting on real-world TGs. ReaL-TG uses outcome-based reward to encourage models to self-explore reasoning strategies from graph structure and to produce explanations that directly justify their predictions. To enable evaluation on LLM-generated reasoning traces, we propose a new evaluation protocol combining ranking metrics with an LLM-as-a-Judge system that assesses both the quality of reasoning and the impact of hallucinations. Experiments with ReaL-TG-4B, obtained by fine-tuning Qwen3-4B under our framework, show that it outperforms much larger frontier LLMs, including GPT-5 mini, on ranking metrics, while producing high-quality explanations confirmed by both the LLM judge and human evaluation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various reasoning and generation tasks. However, their proficiency in complex causal reasoning, discovery, and estimation remains an area of active development, often hindered by issues like hallucination, reliance on spurious correlations, and difficulties in handling nuanced, domain-specific, or personalized causal relationships. Multi-agent systems, leveraging the collaborative or specialized abilities of multiple LLM-based agents, are emerging as a powerful paradigm to address these limitations. This review paper explores the burgeoning field of causal multi-agent LLMs. We examine how these systems are designed to tackle different facets of causality, including causal reasoning and counterfactual analysis, causal discovery from data, and the estimation of causal effects. We delve into the diverse architectural patterns and interaction protocols employed, from pipeline-based processing and debate frameworks to simulation environments and iterative refinement loops. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation methodologies, benchmarks, and diverse application domains where causal multi-agent LLMs are making an impact, including scientific discovery, healthcare, fact-checking, and personalized systems. Finally, we highlight the persistent challenges, open research questions, and promising future directions in this synergistic field, aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of its current state and potential trajectory.

Summary:
Large Language Model (LLM) agents are expected to dominate data system workloads in the future, utilizing a process called agentic speculation for data manipulation and analysis. The volume and inefficiencies of agentic speculation pose challenges for current data systems, necessitating the adaptation of data systems to better support agentic workloads. The characteristics of agentic speculation, including scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability, present opportunities for new research in developing an agent-first data systems architecture. These opportunities range from creating new query interfaces to implementing novel query processing techniques and designing agentic memory stores. By leveraging the identified characteristics of agentic speculation, advancements can be made in optimizing data systems to effectively handle the demands of LLM agents and their data exploration and solution formulation processes.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents, acting on their users' behalf to manipulate and analyze data, are likely to become the dominant workload for data systems in the future. When working with data, agents employ a high-throughput process of exploration and solution formulation for the given task, one we call agentic speculation. The sheer volume and inefficiencies of agentic speculation can pose challenges for present-day data systems. We argue that data systems need to adapt to more natively support agentic workloads. We take advantage of the characteristics of agentic speculation that we identify, i.e., scale, heterogeneity, redundancy, and steerability - to outline a number of new research opportunities for a new agent-first data systems architecture, ranging from new query interfaces, to new query processing techniques, to new agentic memory stores.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, Natural-born Intelligence, open computing, chemical reactions, quantum coherence<br />
Summary:<br />
The article explores the distinction between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born Intelligence, categorizing them into closed computing and open computing. Open computing is implemented in chemical reactions, where the computational process and execution environment merge to adapt to fluctuations. The model treats chemical reactions as computation and the environment as molecule interactions, leading to a system that adjusts through clustering and de-clustering. Open computing is further divided into Token computing, focusing on individual molecule behavior, and Type computing, focusing on normative behavior. The interplay between these two types results in self-organizing critical phenomena and quantum logic, leading to quantum-like coherence and the formation of spike waves for signal transmission. This suggests a quantum-like source for controlling biochemical rhythms. <div>
arXiv:2509.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By uncovering the contrast between Artificial Intelligence and Natural-born Intelligence as a computational process, we define closed computing and open computing, and implement open computing within chemical reactions. This involves forming a mixture and invalidation of the computational process and the execution environment, which are logically distinct, and coalescing both to create a system that adjusts fluctuations. We model chemical reactions by considering the computation as the chemical reaction and the execution environment as the degree of aggregation of molecules that interact with the reactive environment. This results in a chemical reaction that progresses while repeatedly clustering and de-clustering, where concentration no longer holds significant meaning. Open computing is segmented into Token computing, which focuses on the individual behavior of chemical molecules, and Type computing, which focuses on normative behavior. Ultimately, both are constructed as an interplay between the two. In this system, Token computing demonstrates self-organizing critical phenomena, while Type computing exhibits quantum logic. Through their interplay, the recruitment of fluctuations is realized, giving rise to interactions between quantum logical subspaces corresponding to quantum coherence across different Hilbert spaces. As a result, spike waves are formed, enabling signal transmission. This occurrence may be termed quantum-like coherence, implying the source of enzymes responsible for controlling spike waves and biochemical rhythms.

Summary:
The article introduces the Block Rearrangement Problem (BRaP) in warehouse management, which involves rearranging storage blocks within dense grids to achieve a target state. BRaP is formally defined as a graph search problem. Five search-based solution algorithms are proposed, drawing inspiration from sliding puzzle problems and utilizing joint configuration space search, classical planning, multi-agent pathfinding, and expert heuristics. Empirical evaluations show that these methods are efficient in creating rearrangement plans even for deeply buried blocks in large grids up to 80x80 dimensions, despite the exponential increase in search space size with the number of blocks. The study emphasizes the importance of efficient algorithms for tackling complex warehouse management tasks such as block rearrangement.

Experiments show that current GUI agents struggle with completing full storylines, but COAST shows promise in bridging the observation-behavior gap and improving milestone completion. However, there is still a significant gap between the performance of the best-performing agents and human players, highlighting the need for further research to narrow this divide. <div>

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.

While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research.

<div> reasoning, task planning, natural language interaction, hierarchical robot system, end-to-end framework 

Summary: 
Robix is a unified model that combines robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction in a single architecture. It generates commands for robots and verbal responses for humans, enabling complex instruction following and natural interaction. The model includes proactive dialogue, interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. Robix is trained in three stages: continued pretraining for foundational reasoning abilities, supervised finetuning for human-robot interaction modeling, and reinforcement learning for long-horizon task coherence. In experiments, Robix outperforms baselines in interactive task execution across various instruction types and user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Robix, a unified model that integrates robot reasoning, task planning, and natural language interaction within a single vision-language architecture. Acting as the high-level cognitive layer in a hierarchical robot system, Robix dynamically generates atomic commands for the low-level controller and verbal responses for human interaction, enabling robots to follow complex instructions, plan long-horizon tasks, and interact naturally with human within an end-to-end framework. Robix further introduces novel capabilities such as proactive dialogue, real-time interruption handling, and context-aware commonsense reasoning during task execution. At its core, Robix leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and adopts a three-stage training strategy: (1) continued pretraining to enhance foundational embodied reasoning abilities including 3D spatial understanding, visual grounding, and task-centric reasoning; (2) supervised finetuning to model human-robot interaction and task planning as a unified reasoning-action sequence; and (3) reinforcement learning to improve reasoning-action consistency and long-horizon task coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Robix outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines (e.g., GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro) in interactive task execution, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse instruction types (e.g., open-ended, multi-stage, constrained, invalid, and interrupted) and various user-involved tasks such as table bussing, grocery shopping, and dietary filtering.

<div> Keywords: causal abstraction, simulation, language models, causality, philosophers<br />
Summary: <br />
This note introduces the concept of causal abstractive simulation, which is a formalization method for language model simulation. It discusses how language models can simulate a fair coin toss and presents examples of both successful and unsuccessful simulations. The formalism of causal abstractive simulation can be used to prove that a language model accurately simulates another system, based on a causal description of the system. This approach connects statistical benchmarking practices in language model simulation to a solid foundation of causality. It may be of interest to practitioners in the field of language model simulation, as well as philosophers of AI and mind who are interested in the role-playing aspect of language models. Additionally, mathematicians and researchers working on causal abstraction can find a new application of core ideas in this variation of causal abstraction. <div>

Abstract: This note illustrates how a variety of causal abstraction arXiv:1707.00819 arXiv:1812.03789, defined here as causal abstractive simulation, can be used to formalize a simple example of language model simulation. This note considers the case of simulating a fair coin toss with a language model. Examples are presented illustrating the ways language models can fail to simulate, and a success case is presented, illustrating how this formalism may be used to prove that a language model simulates some other system, given a causal description of the system. This note may be of interest to three groups. For practitioners in the growing field of language model simulation, causal abstractive simulation is a means to connect ad-hoc statistical benchmarking practices to the solid formal foundation of causality. Philosophers of AI and philosophers of mind may be interested as causal abstractive simulation gives a precise operationalization to the idea that language models are role-playing arXiv:2402.12422. Mathematicians and others working on causal abstraction may be interested to see a new application of the core ideas that yields a new variation of causal abstraction.

Summary: <br />
Identifying product listings referring to the same SKU in ecommerce is challenging due to missing identifiers and varied product names. The Q2K framework leverages Large Language Models for accurate SKU mapping by using a Reasoning Agent to generate questions, a Knowledge Agent to resolve them through web searches, and a Deduplication Agent to reduce redundancy. Human input refines uncertain cases. Q2K outperforms baselines in accuracy and robustness, particularly in bundle and brand disambiguation. By reusing reasoning, Q2K balances efficiency and accuracy, offering a scalable solution for product integration. <div>

Abstract: Identifying whether two product listings refer to the same Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) is a persistent challenge in ecommerce, especially when explicit identifiers are missing and product names vary widely across platforms. Rule based heuristics and keyword similarity often misclassify products by overlooking subtle distinctions in brand, specification, or bundle configuration. To overcome these limitations, we propose Question to Knowledge (Q2K), a multi agent framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for reliable SKU mapping. Q2K integrates: (1) a Reasoning Agent that generates targeted disambiguation questions, (2) a Knowledge Agent that resolves them via focused web searches, and (3) a Deduplication Agent that reuses validated reasoning traces to reduce redundancy and ensure consistency. A human in the loop mechanism further refines uncertain cases. Experiments on real world consumer goods datasets show that Q2K surpasses strong baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in difficult scenarios such as bundle identification and brand origin disambiguation. By reusing retrieved reasoning instead of issuing repeated searches, Q2K balances accuracy with efficiency, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for product integration.

<div> Knowledge Graphs, Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, AnchorRAG, Multi-agent Collaboration

Summary:
AnchorRAG is introduced as a novel framework for open-world Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that does not rely on predefined anchor entities. This multi-agent collaboration approach involves a predictor agent for identifying candidate anchor entities, retriever agents for conducting multi-hop explorations, and a supervisor agent to formulate retrieval strategies. By dynamically aligning query terms with Knowledge Graph nodes, AnchorRAG improves retrieval robustness and mitigates errors in anchor entity linking. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that AnchorRAG outperforms existing baselines, achieving new state-of-the-art results in real-world question answering tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning. However, their dependence on static training corpora makes them prone to factual errors and knowledge gaps. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by incorporating external knowledge sources, especially structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which provide explicit semantics and efficient retrieval. Existing KG-based RAG approaches, however, generally assume that anchor entities are accessible to initiate graph traversal, which limits their robustness in open world settings where accurate linking between the query and the entity is unreliable. To overcome this limitation, we propose AnchorRAG, a novel multi-agent collaboration framework for open-world RAG without the predefined anchor entities. Specifically, a predictor agent dynamically identifies candidate anchor entities by aligning user query terms with KG nodes and initializes independent retriever agents to conduct parallel multi-hop explorations from each candidate. Then a supervisor agent formulates the iterative retrieval strategy for these retriever agents and synthesizes the resulting knowledge paths to generate the final answer. This multi-agent collaboration framework improves retrieval robustness and mitigates the impact of ambiguous or erroneous anchors. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that AnchorRAG significantly outperforms existing baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art results on the real-world question answering tasks.

<title>Towards Agentic OS: An LLM Agent Framework for Linux Schedulers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01245</link>

arXiv:2509.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operating system schedulers suffer from a fundamental semantic gap, where kernel policies fail to understand application-specific needs, leading to suboptimal performance. We introduce SchedCP, the first framework that enables fully autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents to safely and efficiently optimize Linux schedulers without human involvement. Our core insight is that the challenge is not merely to apply a better LLM, but to architect a decoupled control plane that separates the AI's role of semantic reasoning ("what to optimize") from the system's role of execution ("how to observe and act"). Implemented as Model Context Protocol(MCP) server, SchedCP provides a stable interface with three key services: a Workload Analysis Engine, an evolving Scheduler Policy Repository, and an Execution Verifier that validates all AI-generated code and configure before deployment with static and dynamic analysis.
  We demonstrate this architecture's power with sched-agent, a multi-agent system that autonomously analyzes workloads, synthesizes custom eBPF scheduling policies, and deploys them via the sched\_ext infrastructure. Our evaluation shows that SchedCP achieves up to an 1.79x performance improvement, and a 13x cost reduction compared to naive agentic approaches, all while maintaining high success rate. By bridging the semantic gap, SchedCP democratizes expert-level system optimization and represents a step towards creating truly self-optimizing, application-aware operating systems. The code is open-sourced in https://github.com/eunomia-bpf/schedcp

<title>Communicative Agents for Slideshow Storytelling Video Generation based on LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), the proliferation of AI-generated content (AIGC) tasks has significantly accelerated developments in text-to-video generation. As a result, the field of video production is undergoing a transformative shift. However, conventional text-to-video models are typically constrained by high computational costs.
  In this study, we propose Video-Generation-Team (VGTeam), a novel slide show video generation system designed to redefine the video creation pipeline through the integration of large language models (LLMs). VGTeam is composed of a suite of communicative agents, each responsible for a distinct aspect of video generation, such as scriptwriting, scene creation, and audio design. These agents operate collaboratively within a chat tower workflow, transforming user-provided textual prompts into coherent, slide-style narrative videos.
  By emulating the sequential stages of traditional video production, VGTeam achieves remarkable improvements in both efficiency and scalability, while substantially reducing computational overhead. On average, the system generates videos at a cost of only $0.103, with a successful generation rate of 98.4%. Importantly, this framework maintains a high degree of creative fidelity and customization.
  The implications of VGTeam are far-reaching. It democratizes video production by enabling broader access to high-quality content creation without the need for extensive resources. Furthermore, it highlights the transformative potential of language models in creative domains and positions VGTeam as a pioneering system for next-generation content creation.

<title>GradeSQL: Outcome Reward Models for Ranking SQL Queries from Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01308</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL, the task of translating natural language questions into SQL queries, has significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs), broadening database accessibility for a wide range of users. Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries that require precise alignment between user intent and the database schema. To mitigate this, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can generate correct answers but may require multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting either the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated query with Maj. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising approach for better aligning model predictions with user intent. Nevertheless, their application to Text-to-SQL remains largely underexplored.
  In this work, we evaluate ORMs as an effective heuristic for BoN, compare them with ex-BoN and Maj, and introduce a framework for training ORMs for the Text-to-SQL task. We evaluate our ORMs on the BIRD and SPIDER benchmarks, finetuning various open-source LLMs, including the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 model families. Our results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.

<title>Conformal Predictive Monitoring for Multi-Modal Scenarios</title>

Abstract: We consider the problem of quantitative predictive monitoring (QPM) of stochastic systems, i.e., predicting at runtime the degree of satisfaction of a desired temporal logic property from the current state of the system. Since computational efficiency is key to enable timely intervention against predicted violations, several state-of-the-art QPM approaches rely on fast machine-learning surrogates to provide prediction intervals for the satisfaction values, using conformal inference to offer statistical guarantees. However, these QPM methods suffer when the monitored agent exhibits multi-modal dynamics, whereby certain modes may yield high satisfaction values while others critically violate the property. Existing QPM methods are mode-agnostic and so would yield overly conservative and uninformative intervals that lack meaningful mode-specific satisfaction information. To address this problem, we present GenQPM, a method that leverages deep generative models, specifically score-based diffusion models, to reliably approximate the probabilistic and multi-modal system dynamics without requiring explicit model access. GenQPM employs a mode classifier to partition the predicted trajectories by dynamical mode. For each mode, we then apply conformal inference to produce statistically valid, mode-specific prediction intervals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GenQPM on a benchmark of agent navigation and autonomous driving tasks, resulting in prediction intervals that are significantly more informative (less conservative) than mode-agnostic baselines.

<title>Error Notebook-Guided, Training-Free Part Retrieval in 3D CAD Assemblies via Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01350</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective specification-aware part retrieval within complex CAD assemblies is essential for automated design verification and downstream engineering tasks. However, directly using LLMs/VLMs to this task presents some challenges: the input sequences may exceed model token limits, and even after processing, performance remains unsatisfactory. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs/VLMs requires significant computational resources, and for many high-performing general-use proprietary models (e.g., GPT or Gemini), fine-tuning access is not available. In this paper, we propose a novel part retrieval framework that requires no extra training, but using Error Notebooks + RAG for refined prompt engineering to help improve the existing general model's retrieval performance. The construction of Error Notebooks consists of two steps: (1) collecting historical erroneous CoTs and their incorrect answers, and (2) connecting these CoTs through reflective corrections until the correct solutions are obtained. As a result, the Error Notebooks serve as a repository of tasks along with their corrected CoTs and final answers. RAG is then employed to retrieve specification-relevant records from the Error Notebooks and incorporate them into the inference process. Another major contribution of our work is a human-in-the-loop CAD dataset, which is used to evaluate our method. In addition, the engineering value of our novel framework lies in its ability to effectively handle 3D models with lengthy, non-natural language metadata. Experiments with proprietary models, including GPT-4o and the Gemini series, show substantial gains, with GPT-4o (Omni) achieving up to a 23.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the human preference dataset. Moreover, ablation studies confirm that CoT reasoning provides benefits especially in challenging cases with higher part counts (>10).

Abstract: Deep research agents have attracted growing attention for their potential to orchestrate multi-stage research workflows, spanning literature synthesis, methodological design, and empirical verification. Despite these strides, evaluating their research capability faithfully is rather challenging due to the difficulty of collecting frontier research questions that genuinely capture researchers' attention and intellectual curiosity. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch Arena, a benchmark grounded in academic seminars that capture rich expert discourse and interaction, better reflecting real-world research environments and reducing the risk of data leakage. To automatically construct DeepResearch Arena, we propose a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Task Generation (MAHTG) system that extracts research-worthy inspirations from seminar transcripts. The MAHTG system further translates research-worthy inspirations into high-quality research tasks, ensuring the traceability of research task formulation while filtering noise. With the MAHTG system, we curate DeepResearch Arena with over 10,000 high-quality research tasks from over 200 academic seminars, spanning 12 disciplines, such as literature, history, and science. Our extensive evaluation shows that DeepResearch Arena presents substantial challenges for current state-of-the-art agents, with clear performance gaps observed across different models.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the practice of science. Machine learning and large language models (LLMs) can generate hypotheses at a scale and speed far exceeding traditional methods, offering the potential to accelerate discovery across diverse fields. However, the abundance of hypotheses introduces a critical challenge: without scalable and reliable mechanisms for verification, scientific progress risks being hindered rather than being advanced. In this article, we trace the historical development of scientific discovery, examine how AI is reshaping established practices for scientific discovery, and review the principal approaches, ranging from data-driven methods and knowledge-aware neural architectures to symbolic reasoning frameworks and LLM agents. While these systems can uncover patterns and propose candidate laws, their scientific value ultimately depends on rigorous and transparent verification, which we argue must be the cornerstone of AI-assisted discovery.

<title>LLM-empowered Agents Simulation Framework for Scenario Generation in Service Ecosystem Governance</title>

Abstract: As the social environment is growing more complex and collaboration is deepening, factors affecting the healthy development of service ecosystem are constantly changing and diverse, making its governance a crucial research issue. Applying the scenario analysis method and conducting scenario rehearsals by constructing an experimental system before managers make decisions, losses caused by wrong decisions can be largely avoided. However, it relies on predefined rules to construct scenarios and faces challenges such as limited information, a large number of influencing factors, and the difficulty of measuring social elements. These challenges limit the quality and efficiency of generating social and uncertain scenarios for the service ecosystem. Therefore, we propose a scenario generator design method, which adaptively coordinates three Large Language Model (LLM) empowered agents that autonomously optimize experimental schemes to construct an experimental system and generate high quality scenarios. Specifically, the Environment Agent (EA) generates social environment including extremes, the Social Agent (SA) generates social collaboration structure, and the Planner Agent (PA) couples task-role relationships and plans task solutions. These agents work in coordination, with the PA adjusting the experimental scheme in real time by perceiving the states of each agent and these generating scenarios. Experiments on the ProgrammableWeb dataset illustrate our method generates more accurate scenarios more efficiently, and innovatively provides an effective way for service ecosystem governance related experimental system construction.

<title>Counterfactual Sensitivity for Faithful Reasoning in Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce correct answers while relying on flawed or irrelevant reasoning traces, undermining their trustworthiness in high-stakes domains. We propose Counterfactual Sensitivity Regularization (CSR), a lightweight training objective that enforces dependence between intermediate reasoning and final outputs. CSR introduces automated, operator-level counterfactual interventions (e.g., swapping "+" with "-") during training and penalizes models that preserve the same answer under logically invalid traces. This requires only one additional forward pass per sample. To measure faithfulness, we introduce Counterfactual Outcome Sensitivity (COS), which quantifies the impact of such perturbations on model predictions. Across structured reasoning tasks - arithmetic (GSM8K), logical deduction (PrOntoQA), and planning (Blocks World) - CSR improves faithfulness by up to 70 percentage points over standard fine-tuning and process supervision, with only minor accuracy loss. The learned sensitivity generalizes to larger models and synergizes with inference-time methods such as self-consistency. A pilot study on HellaSwag further demonstrates that extending CSR with semantic perturbations can enhance faithfulness in commonsense reasoning.

Abstract: With artificial intelligence (AI) being applied to bring autonomy to decision-making in safety-critical domains such as the ones typified in the aerospace and emergency-response services, there has been a call to address the ethical implications of structuring those decisions, so they remain reliable and justifiable when human lives are at stake. This paper contributes to addressing the challenge of decision-making by proposing a structured decision-making framework as a foundational step towards responsible AI. The proposed structured decision-making framework is implemented in autonomous decision-making, specifically within disaster management. By introducing concepts of Enabler agents, Levels and Scenarios, the proposed framework's performance is evaluated against systems relying solely on judgement-based insights, as well as human operators who have disaster experience: victims, volunteers, and stakeholders. The results demonstrate that the structured decision-making framework achieves 60.94% greater stability in consistently accurate decisions across multiple Scenarios, compared to judgement-based systems. Moreover, the study shows that the proposed framework outperforms human operators with a 38.93% higher accuracy across various Scenarios. These findings demonstrate the promise of the structured decision-making framework for building more reliable autonomous AI applications in safety-critical contexts.

Abstract: AI web agents use Internet resources at far greater speed, scale, and complexity -- changing how users and services interact. Deployed maliciously or erroneously, these agents could overload content providers. At the same time, web agents can bypass CAPTCHAs and other defenses by mimicking user behavior or flood authentication systems with fake accounts. Yet providers must protect their services and content from denial-of-service attacks and scraping by web agents. In this paper, we design a framework that imposes tunable costs on agents before providing access to resources; we call this Web Agent Throttling. We start by formalizing Throttling Gates as challenges issued to an agent that are asymmetric, scalable, robust, and compatible with any agent. Focusing on a common component -- the language model -- we require the agent to solve reasoning puzzles, thereby incurring excessive token-generation costs. However, we find that using existing puzzles, e.g., coding or math, as throttling gates fails to satisfy our properties. To address this, we introduce rebus-based Reasoning Gates, synthetic text puzzles that require multi-hop reasoning over world knowledge (thereby throttling an agent's model). We design a scalable generation and verification protocol for such reasoning gates. Our framework achieves computational asymmetry, i.e., the response-generation cost is 9.2x higher than the generation cost for SOTA models. We further deploy reasoning gates on a custom website and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and evaluate with real-world web agents. Finally, we discuss the limitations and environmental impact of real-world deployment of our framework.

<title>Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known as "Jailbreak." While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model's internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can effectively control the model's behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%. Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: Physics provides fundamental laws that describe and predict the natural world. AI systems aspiring toward more general, real-world intelligence must therefore demonstrate strong physics problem-solving abilities: to formulate and apply physical laws for explaining and predicting physical processes. The International Physics Olympiad (IPhO)--the world's most prestigious physics competition--offers a rigorous benchmark for this purpose. We introduce Physics Supernova, an AI agent system with superior physics problem-solving abilities that match elite IPhO gold medalists. In IPhO 2025 theory problems, Physics Supernova attains 23.5/30 points, ranking 14th of 406 contestants and surpassing the median performance of human gold medalists. We extensively analyzed Physics Supernova's capabilities and flexibility across diverse physics tasks. These results show that principled tool integration within agent systems can deliver competitive improvements in solving challenging science problems. The codes are available at https://github.com/CharlesQ9/Physics-Supernova.

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites, despite claiming otherwise, due to the practical difficulty in comprehending them. The mist of data privacy practices forms a major barrier for user-centred Web approaches, and for data sharing and reusing in an agentic world. Existing research proposed methods for using formal languages and reasoning for verifying the compliance of a specified policy, as a potential cure for ignoring privacy policies. However, a critical gap remains in the creation or acquisition of such formal policies at scale. We present a semantic-centric approach for using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM), to automatically identify key information about privacy practices from privacy policies, and construct $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$, knowledge graph with grounding from Data Privacy Vocabulary (DPV) for privacy practices, to support downstream tasks. Along with the pipeline, the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ for the top-100 popular websites is also released as a public resource, by using the pipeline for analysis. We also demonstrate how the $\mathit{Pr}^2\mathit{Graph}$ can be used to support downstream tasks by constructing formal policy representations such as Open Digital Right Language (ODRL) or perennial semantic Data Terms of Use (psDToU). To evaluate the technology capability, we enriched the Policy-IE dataset by employing legal experts to create custom annotations. We benchmarked the performance of different large language models for our pipeline and verified their capabilities. Overall, they shed light on the possibility of large-scale analysis of online services' privacy practices, as a promising direction to audit the Web and the Internet. We release all datasets and source code as public resources to facilitate reuse and improvement.

<title>Oyster-I: Beyond Refusal -- Constructive Safety Alignment for Responsible Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent harmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks posed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and relying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come from non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g., self-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly influence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat, escalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce Constructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects against malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe and helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic anticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and interpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process. Oy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high general capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong constructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the Strata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from refusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user relationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully helpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible, user-centered AI.

Abstract: Heuristic and scaffolded teacher-student dialogues are widely regarded as critical for fostering students' higher-order thinking and deep learning. However, large language models (LLMs) currently face challenges in generating pedagogically rich interactions. This study systematically investigates the structural and behavioral differences between AI-simulated and authentic human tutoring dialogues. We conducted a quantitative comparison using an Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) coding scheme and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA). The results show that human dialogues are significantly superior to their AI counterparts in utterance length, as well as in questioning (I-Q) and general feedback (F-F) behaviors. More importantly, ENA results reveal a fundamental divergence in interactional patterns: human dialogues are more cognitively guided and diverse, centered around a "question-factual response-feedback" teaching loop that clearly reflects pedagogical guidance and student-driven thinking; in contrast, simulated dialogues exhibit a pattern of structural simplification and behavioral convergence, revolving around an "explanation-simplistic response" loop that is essentially a simple information transfer between the teacher and student. These findings illuminate key limitations in current AI-generated tutoring and provide empirical guidance for designing and evaluating more pedagogically effective generative educational dialogue systems.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable success in complex tasks propelling widespread adoption, large language-model-based agents still face critical deployment challenges due to prohibitive latency and inference costs. While recent work has explored various methods to accelerate inference, existing approaches suffer from significant limitations: they either fail to preserve performance fidelity, require extensive offline training of router modules, or incur excessive operational costs. Moreover, they provide minimal user control over the tradeoff between acceleration and other performance metrics. To address these gaps, we introduce Dynamic Speculative Planning (DSP), an asynchronous online reinforcement learning framework that provides lossless acceleration with substantially reduced costs without requiring additional pre-deployment preparation. DSP explicitly optimizes a joint objective balancing end-to-end latency against dollar cost, allowing practitioners to adjust a single parameter that steers the system toward faster responses, cheaper operation, or any point along this continuum. Experiments on two standard agent benchmarks demonstrate that DSP achieves comparable efficiency to the fastest lossless acceleration method while reducing total cost by 30% and unnecessary cost up to 60%. Our code and data are available through https://github.com/guanyilin428/Dynamic-Speculative-Planning.

<title>EigenBench: A Comparative Behavioral Measure of Value Alignment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aligning AI with human values is a pressing unsolved problem. To address the lack of quantitative metrics for value alignment, we propose EigenBench: a black-box method for comparatively benchmarking language models' values. Given an ensemble of models, a constitution describing a value system, and a dataset of scenarios, our method returns a vector of scores quantifying each model's alignment to the given constitution. To produce these scores, each model judges the outputs of other models across many scenarios, and these judgments are aggregated with EigenTrust (Kamvar et al, 2003), yielding scores that reflect a weighted-average judgment of the whole ensemble. EigenBench uses no ground truth labels, as it is designed to quantify traits for which reasonable judges may disagree on the correct label. Using prompted personas, we test whether EigenBench scores are more sensitive to the model or the prompt: we find that most of the variance is explained by the prompt, but a small residual quantifies the disposition of the model itself.

<title>mFARM: Towards Multi-Faceted Fairness Assessment based on HARMs in Clinical Decision Support</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02007</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes medical settings poses a critical AI alignment challenge, as models can inherit and amplify societal biases, leading to significant disparities. Existing fairness evaluation methods fall short in these contexts as they typically use simplistic metrics that overlook the multi-dimensional nature of medical harms. This also promotes models that are fair only because they are clinically inert, defaulting to safe but potentially inaccurate outputs. To address this gap, our contributions are mainly two-fold: first, we construct two large-scale, controlled benchmarks (ED-Triage and Opioid Analgesic Recommendation) from MIMIC-IV, comprising over 50,000 prompts with twelve race x gender variants and three context tiers. Second, we propose a multi-metric framework - Multi-faceted Fairness Assessment based on hARMs ($mFARM$) to audit fairness for three distinct dimensions of disparity (Allocational, Stability, and Latent) and aggregate them into an $mFARM$ score. We also present an aggregated Fairness-Accuracy Balance (FAB) score to benchmark and observe trade-offs between fairness and prediction accuracy. We empirically evaluate four open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B, BioMistral-7B, Qwen-2.5-7B, Bio-LLaMA3-8B) and their finetuned versions under quantization and context variations. Our findings showcase that the proposed $mFARM$ metrics capture subtle biases more effectively under various settings. We find that most models maintain robust performance in terms of $mFARM$ score across varying levels of quantization but deteriorate significantly when the context is reduced. Our benchmarks and evaluation code are publicly released to enhance research in aligned AI for healthcare.

Abstract: Many scientists use generative AI in their scientific work. People working in technology assessment (TA) are no exception. TA's approach to generative AI is twofold: on the one hand, generative AI is used for TA work, and on the other hand, generative AI is the subject of TA research. After briefly outlining the phenomenon of generative AI and formulating requirements for its use in TA, the following article discusses in detail the structural causes of the problems associated with it. Although generative AI is constantly being further developed, the structurally induced risks remain. The article concludes with proposed solutions and brief notes on their feasibility, as well as some examples of the use of generative AI in TA work.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is often measured by the range of tasks it can perform. Yet wide ability without depth remains only an imitation. This paper proposes a Structural-Generative Ontology of Intelligence: true intelligence exists only when a system can generate new structures, coordinate them into reasons, and sustain its identity over time. These three conditions -- generativity, coordination, and sustaining -- define the depth that underlies real intelligence. Current AI systems, however broad in function, remain surface simulations because they lack this depth. Breadth is not the source of intelligence but the growth that follows from depth. If future systems were to meet these conditions, they would no longer be mere tools, but could be seen as a possible Second Being, standing alongside yet distinct from human existence.

<title>LLMs for LLMs: A Structured Prompting Methodology for Long Legal Documents</title>

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has had a profoundly transformative effect on a number of fields and domains. However, their uptake in Law has proven more challenging due to the important issues of reliability and transparency. In this study, we present a structured prompting methodology as a viable alternative to the often expensive fine-tuning, with the capability of tacking long legal documents from the CUAD dataset on the task of information retrieval. Each document is first split into chunks via a system of chunking and augmentation, addressing the long document problem. Then, alongside an engineered prompt, the input is fed into QWEN-2 to produce a set of answers for each question. Finally, we tackle the resulting candidate selection problem with the introduction of the Distribution-based Localisation and Inverse Cardinality Weighting heuristics. This approach leverages a general purpose model to promote long term scalability, prompt engineering to increase reliability and the two heuristic strategies to reduce the impact of the black box effect. Whilst our model performs up to 9\% better than the previously presented method, reaching state-of-the-art performance, it also highlights the limiting factor of current automatic evaluation metrics for question answering, serving as a call to action for future research. However, the chief aim of this work is to underscore the potential of structured prompt engineering as a useful, yet under-explored, tool in ensuring accountability and responsibility of AI in the legal domain, and beyond.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), together with the increased availability of social media and news for epidemiological surveillance, are marking a pivotal moment in epidemiology and public health research. Leveraging the power of generative AI, we use an ensemble approach which incorporates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract valuable actionable epidemiological information from the World Health Organization (WHO) Disease Outbreak News (DONs). DONs is a collection of regular reports on global outbreaks curated by the WHO and the adopted decision-making processes to respond to them. The extracted information is made available in a daily-updated dataset and a knowledge graph, referred to as eKG, derived to provide a nuanced representation of the public health domain knowledge. We provide an overview of this new dataset and describe the structure of eKG, along with the services and tools used to access and utilize the data that we are building on top. These innovative data resources open altogether new opportunities for epidemiological research, and the analysis and surveillance of disease outbreaks.

<title>Rewarding Explainability in Drug Repurposing with Knowledge Graphs</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are powerful tools for modelling complex, multi-relational data and supporting hypothesis generation, particularly in applications like drug repurposing. However, for predictive methods to gain acceptance as credible scientific tools, they must ensure not only accuracy but also the capacity to offer meaningful scientific explanations. This paper presents a novel approach REx, for generating scientific explanations based in link prediction in knowledge graphs. It employs reward and policy mechanisms that consider desirable properties of scientific explanation to guide a reinforcement learning agent in the identification of explanatory paths within a KG. The approach further enriches explanatory paths with domain-specific ontologies, ensuring that the explanations are both insightful and grounded in established biomedical knowledge. We evaluate our approach in drug repurposing using three popular knowledge graph benchmarks. The results clearly demonstrate its ability to generate explanations that validate predictive insights against biomedical knowledge and that outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in predictive performance, establishing REx as a relevant contribution to advance AI-driven scientific discovery.

<title>Re-evaluating LLM-based Heuristic Search: A Case Study on the 3D Packing Problem</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02297</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.02297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The art of heuristic design has traditionally been a human pursuit. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code for search heuristics, their application has largely been confined to adjusting simple functions within human-crafted frameworks, leaving their capacity for broader innovation an open question. To investigate this, we tasked an LLM with building a complete solver for the constrained 3D Packing Problem. Direct code generation quickly proved fragile, prompting us to introduce two supports: constraint scaffolding--prewritten constraint-checking code--and iterative self-correction--additional refinement cycles to repair bugs and produce a viable initial population. Notably, even within a vast search space in a greedy process, the LLM concentrated its efforts almost exclusively on refining the scoring function. This suggests that the emphasis on scoring functions in prior work may reflect not a principled strategy, but rather a natural limitation of LLM capabilities. The resulting heuristic was comparable to a human-designed greedy algorithm, and when its scoring function was integrated into a human-crafted metaheuristic, its performance rivaled established solvers, though its effectiveness waned as constraints tightened. Our findings highlight two major barriers to automated heuristic design with current LLMs: the engineering required to mitigate their fragility in complex reasoning tasks, and the influence of pretrained biases, which can prematurely narrow the search for novel solutions.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have enabled significant progress in tasks such as generating and editing images from text, as well as creating videos from text prompts, and these methods are being applied across various fields. However, in the financial domain, there may still be a reliance on time-series data and a continued focus on transformer models, rather than on diverse applications of generative models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages text-to-image model by treating time-series data as a single image pattern, thereby enabling the prediction of stock price trends. Unlike prior methods that focus on learning and classifying chart patterns using architectures such as ResNet or ViT, we experiment with generating the next chart image from the current chart image and an instruction prompt using diffusion models. Furthermore, we introduce a simple method for evaluating the generated chart image against ground truth image. We highlight the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models in the financial domain, and our findings motivate further research to address the current limitations and expand their applicability.

arXiv:2509.02340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spectral information for precise material classification and analysis; however, its high dimensionality introduces a computational burden and redundancy, making dimensionality reduction essential. We present an exploratory study into the application of post-hoc explainability methods in a model--driven framework for band selection, which reduces the spectral dimension while preserving predictive performance. A trained classifier is probed with explanations to quantify each band's contribution to its decisions. We then perform deletion--insertion evaluations, recording confidence changes as ranked bands are removed or reintroduced, and aggregate these signals into influence scores. Selecting the highest--influence bands yields compact spectral subsets that maintain accuracy and improve efficiency. Experiments on two public benchmarks (Pavia University and Salinas) demonstrate that classifiers trained on as few as 30 selected bands match or exceed full--spectrum baselines while reducing computational requirements. The resulting subsets align with physically meaningful, highly discriminative wavelength regions, indicating that model--aligned, explanation-guided band selection is a principled route to effective dimensionality reduction for HSI.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed for complex, multi-step software engineering (SWE) tasks. However, their trajectories often contain costly inefficiencies, such as redundant exploration, looping, and failure to terminate once a solution is reached. Prior work has largely treated these errors in a post-hoc manner, diagnosing failures only after execution. In this paper, we introduce SWE-PRM, an inference-time Process Reward Model (PRM) that intervenes during execution to detect and course-correct trajectory-level errors. Our PRM design leverages a taxonomy of common inefficiencies and delivers lightweight, interpretable feedback without modifying the underlying policy. On SWE-bench Verified, closed-source PRMs improve resolution from 40.0% to 50.6% (+10.6 p.p.), with the largest gains on medium and hard tasks. Among feedback strategies, taxonomy-guided PRMs outperform unguided or explicit action-prescriptive variants, increasing success rate while reducing trajectory length. These benefits come at an acceptable added inference cost of as low as $0.2, making PRMs a practical and scalable mechanism for improving SWE agents' reliability and efficiency.

<title>Towards Agents That Know When They Don't Know: Uncertainty as a Control Signal for Structured Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2509.02401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in structured biomedical data environments, yet they often produce fluent but overconfident outputs when reasoning over complex multi-table data. We introduce an uncertainty-aware agent for query-conditioned multi-table summarization that leverages two complementary signals: (i) retrieval uncertainty--entropy over multiple table-selection rollouts--and (ii) summary uncertainty--combining self-consistency and perplexity. Summary uncertainty is incorporated into reinforcement learning (RL) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), while both retrieval and summary uncertainty guide inference-time filtering and support the construction of higher-quality synthetic datasets.
  On multi-omics benchmarks, our approach improves factuality and calibration, nearly tripling correct and useful claims per summary (3.0\(\rightarrow\)8.4 internal; 3.6\(\rightarrow\)9.9 cancer multi-omics) and substantially improving downstream survival prediction (C-index 0.32\(\rightarrow\)0.63). These results demonstrate that uncertainty can serve as a control signal--enabling agents to abstain, communicate confidence, and become more reliable tools for complex structured-data environments.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal foundation models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that must be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, modalities, apps, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose on-device assistant that operates across applications and constitutes a full-stack, closed-loop system from data to deployment. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end autonomous pipeline spanning data collection, training, deployment, high-quality and efficient inference, and mobile application development. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables user personalization and experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-app and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile app support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency, memory, and energy across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements along all four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher-precision on-screen actions, more reliable long-horizon task completion, and faster, more resource-efficient runtime.

Abstract: The complexity of traditional power system analysis workflows presents significant barriers to efficient decision-making in modern electric grids. This paper presents GridMind, a multi-agent AI system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with deterministic engineering solvers to enable conversational scientific computing for power system analysis. The system employs specialized agents coordinating AC Optimal Power Flow and N-1 contingency analysis through natural language interfaces while maintaining numerical precision via function calls. GridMind addresses workflow integration, knowledge accessibility, context preservation, and expert decision-support augmentation. Experimental evaluation on IEEE test cases demonstrates that the proposed agentic framework consistently delivers correct solutions across all tested language models, with smaller LLMs achieving comparable analytical accuracy with reduced computational latency. This work establishes agentic AI as a viable paradigm for scientific computing, demonstrating how conversational interfaces can enhance accessibility while preserving numerical rigor essential for critical engineering applications.

While recent advances in native agent models have shown promise by unifying perception, reasoning, action, and memory through end-to-end learning, open problems remain in data scalability, multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL), the limitations of GUI-only operation, and environment stability. In this technical report, we present UI-TARS-2, a native GUI-centered agent model that addresses these challenges through a systematic training methodology: a data flywheel for scalable data generation, a stabilized multi-turn RL framework, a hybrid GUI environment that integrates file systems and terminals, and a unified sandbox platform for large-scale rollouts. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that UI-TARS-2 achieves significant improvements over its predecessor UI-TARS-1.5. On GUI benchmarks, it reaches 88.2 on Online-Mind2Web, 47.5 on OSWorld, 50.6 on WindowsAgentArena, and 73.3 on AndroidWorld, outperforming strong baselines such as Claude and OpenAI agents. In game environments, it attains a mean normalized score of 59.8 across a 15-game suite-roughly 60% of human-level performance-and remains competitive with frontier proprietary models (e.g., OpenAI o3) on LMGame-Bench. Additionally, the model can generalize to long-horizon information-seeking tasks and software engineering benchmarks, highlighting its robustness across diverse agent tasks. Detailed analyses of training dynamics further provide insights into achieving stability and efficiency in large-scale agent RL. These results underscore UI-TARS-2's potential to advance the state of GUI agents and exhibit strong generalization to real-world interactive scenarios.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic reinforcement learning (Agentic RL) marks a paradigm shift from conventional reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLM RL), reframing LLMs from passive sequence generators into autonomous, decision-making agents embedded in complex, dynamic worlds. This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium. By synthesizing over five hundred recent works, this survey charts the contours of this rapidly evolving field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the development of scalable, general-purpose AI agents.

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation (IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore, IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Business email compromise and lateral spear phishing attacks are among modern organizations' most costly and damaging threats. While inbound phishing defenses have improved significantly, most organizations still trust internal emails by default, leaving themselves vulnerable to attacks from compromised employee accounts. In this work, we define and explore the problem of authorship validation: verifying whether a claimed sender actually authored a given email. Authorship validation is a lightweight, real-time defense that complements traditional detection methods by modeling per-sender writing style. Further, the paper presents a collection of new datasets based on the Enron corpus. These simulate inauthentic messages using both human-written and large language model-generated emails. The paper also evaluates two classifiers -- a Naive Bayes model and a character-level convolutional neural network (Char-CNN) -- for the authorship validation task. Our experiments show that the Char-CNN model achieves high accuracy and F1 scores under various circumstances. Finally, we discuss deployment considerations and show that per-sender authorship classifiers are practical for integrating into existing commercial email security systems with low overhead.

Abstract: Traditional power grid infrastructure presents significant barriers to renewable energy integration and perpetuates energy access inequities, with low-income communities experiencing disproportionately longer power outages. This study develops a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to optimize renewable energy allocation while explicitly addressing social equity concerns in electricity distribution. The model incorporates budget constraints, energy demand variability, and social vulnerability indicators across eight major U.S. cities to evaluate policy alternatives for equitable clean energy transitions. Numerical experiments compare the MDP-based approach against baseline policies including random allocation, greedy renewable expansion, and expert heuristics. Results demonstrate that equity-focused optimization can achieve 32.9% renewable energy penetration while reducing underserved low-income populations by 55% compared to conventional approaches. The expert policy achieved the highest reward, while the Monte Carlo Tree Search baseline provided competitive performance with significantly lower budget utilization, demonstrating that fair distribution of clean energy resources is achievable without sacrificing overall system performance and providing ways for integrating social equity considerations with climate goals and inclusive access to clean power infrastructure.

Abstract: As a promising physical layer security technique, physical layer key generation (PLKG) enables legitimate users to obtain secret keys from wireless channel without security infrastructures. However, in harsh propagation environments, the channel characteristic becomes unsatisfactory, the key generation rate (KGR) is significantly deteriorated. In this paper, we propose a novel fluid antenna (FA) enabled PLKG system to address this challenge. Specifically, we first derive the closed-form expression of the KGR for FA array, and then jointly optimize the precoding matrix and the antenna positions via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Next, to further reduce the computational complexity of the optimization procedure, we develop an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which combines the projected gradient descent (PGD) and the PSO. Simulation results demonstrate that by exploiting the additional spatial degree of freedom (DoF), our FA enabled PLKG system is superior to the benchmarks, such as the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). It is worth highlighting that compared to the conventional uniform planar antenna (UPA), the FA enabled PLKG achieves a 35.42\% KGR performance improvement under PSO algorithm and a 67.73\% KGR performance improvement under AO algorithm, respectively.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition (SER) has been a challenging problem in spoken language processing research, because it is unclear how human emotions are connected to various components of sounds such as pitch, loudness, and energy. This paper aims to tackle this problem using machine learning. Particularly, we built several machine learning models using SVMs, LTSMs, and CNNs to classify emotions in human speeches. In addition, by leveraging transfer learning and data augmentation, we efficiently trained our models to attain decent performances on a relatively small dataset. Our best model was a ResNet34 network, which achieved an accuracy of $66.7\%$ and an F1 score of $0.631$.

Abstract: Conventional music visualisation systems rely on handcrafted ad hoc transformations of shapes and colours that offer only limited expressiveness. We propose two novel pipelines for automatically generating music videos from any user-specified, vocal or instrumental song using off-the-shelf deep learning models. Inspired by the manual workflows of music video producers, we experiment on how well latent feature-based techniques can analyse audio to detect musical qualities, such as emotional cues and instrumental patterns, and distil them into textual scene descriptions using a language model. Next, we employ a generative model to produce the corresponding video clips. To assess the generated videos, we identify several critical aspects and design and conduct a preliminary user evaluation that demonstrates storytelling potential, visual coherency and emotional alignment with the music. Our findings underscore the potential of latent feature techniques and deep generative models to expand music visualisation beyond traditional approaches.

<title>ZeroQAT: Your Quantization-aware Training but Efficient</title>

Abstract: Quantization is an effective technique to reduce the deployment cost of large language models (LLMs), and post-training quantization (PTQ) has been widely studied due to its efficiency. However, existing low-bit PTQ methods suffer from accuracy degradation because their layer-wise optimization introduces cumulative error propagation and misalignment between local reconstruction objectives and downstream performance. While quantization-aware training (QAT) provides a principled solution, its reliance on backpropagation incurs prohibitive data, time, and memory costs, limiting its practicality. To address these challenges, we propose ZeroQAT, a zeroth-order optimization-based QAT framework. ZeroQAT leverages forward-only gradient estimation to eliminate the need for backpropagation, significantly reducing computational and memory overhead while retaining the benefits of end-to-end optimization. Moreover, ZeroQAT jointly learns quantized weights, weight clipping thresholds, and equivalent transformations to mitigate quantization error and handle activation outliers. Experiments demonstrate that ZeroQAT achieves the efficiency of PTQ while retaining the accuracy of QAT, offering a practical solution for high-quality low-bit quantization of LLMs.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of chip performance is critical for ensuring energy efficiency and reliability in semiconductor manufacturing. However, developing minimum operating voltage ($V_{min}$) prediction models at advanced technology nodes is challenging due to limited training data and the complex relationship between process variations and $V_{min}$. To address these issues, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that leverages abundant legacy data from the 16nm technology node to enable accurate $V_{min}$ prediction at the advanced 5nm node. A key innovation of our approach is the integration of input features derived from on-chip silicon odometer sensor data, which provide fine-grained characterization of localized process variations -- an essential factor at the 5nm node -- resulting in significantly improved prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential to accelerate systematic literature reviews (SLRs), yet current approaches often rely on brittle, manually crafted prompts that compromise reliability and reproducibility. This fragility undermines scientific confidence in LLM-assisted evidence synthesis. In response, this work adapts recent advances in declarative prompt optimisation, developed for general-purpose LLM applications, and demonstrates their applicability to the domain of SLR automation. This research proposes a structured, domain-specific framework that embeds task declarations, test suites, and automated prompt tuning into a reproducible SLR workflow. These emerging methods are translated into a concrete blueprint with working code examples, enabling researchers to construct verifiable LLM pipelines that align with established principles of transparency and rigour in evidence synthesis. This is a novel application of such approaches to SLR pipelines.

We demonstrate significant improvements in target prioritization accuracy through ablation studies and provide comprehensive analysis of component contributions. The hybrid fusion approach reduces false positives by 23% while maintaining high detection sensitivity across diverse terrain types.

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models is influenced by their characteristics such as architecture, model sizes, decoding methods and so on. Due to differences in structure or function, the weights in different layers of large models have varying distributions. This paper explores the correlations between different types of layers in terms of weights distribution and studies the potential impact of these correlations on LoRA training effectiveness. Firstly, the study reveals that in the model the cosine distances between weights of different layers manifest power-law distribution. We extract Query-projection, down-projection and other weight matrices from the self-attention layers and MLP layers, calculate the singular values of the matrices using singular value decomposition, and organize a certain number of singular values into matrices according to projection's type. By analyzing the probability distribution of the cosine distances between these matrices, it is found that the cosine distances values between them have distinct power-law distribution characteristics. Secondly, based on the results of distance calculations and analysis across different layers of model, a qualitative method is proposed to describe the distribution characteristics of different models. Next, to construct weights that align with the distribution characteristics, a data generator is designed using a combination of Gaussian process and Pareto distribution functions. The generator is used to simulate the generation of data that aligns with specific distribution characteristics. Finally, based on the aforementioned distribution characteristics and data generation method, the weights in LoRA initialization are reshaped for training. Experimental results indicate that, without altering the model structure or training process, this method achieves a certain improvement in the performance of LoRA training.

Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) continue to face challenges in continual learning, particularly due to catastrophic forgetting, the loss of previously learned knowledge when acquiring new tasks. Inspired by memory consolidation in the human brain, we investigate the internal replay mechanism proposed by~\citep{brain_inspired_replay1}, which reactivates latent representations of prior experiences during learning. As internal replay was identified as the most influential component among the brain-inspired mechanisms in their framework, it serves as the central focus of our in-depth investigation. Using the CIFAR-100 dataset in a class-incremental setting, we evaluate the effectiveness of internal replay, both in isolation and in combination with Synaptic Intelligence (SI). Our experiments show that internal replay significantly mitigates forgetting, especially when paired with SI, but at the cost of reduced initial task accuracy, highlighting a trade-off between memory stability and learning plasticity. Further analyses using log-likelihood distributions, reconstruction errors, silhouette scores, and UMAP projections reveal that internal replay increases representational overlap in latent space, potentially limiting task-specific differentiation. These results underscore the limitations of current brain-inspired methods and suggest future directions for balancing retention and adaptability in continual learning systems.

Abstract: We apply deep learning techniques for anomaly detection to analyze activity of Russian-owned resident space objects (RSO) prior to the Ukraine invasion and assess the results for any findings that can be used as indications and warnings (I&amp;W) of aggressive military behavior for future conflicts. Through analysis of anomalous activity, an understanding of possible tactics and procedures can be established to assess the existence of statistically significant changes in Russian RSO pattern of life/pattern of behavior (PoL/PoB) using publicly available two-line element (TLE) data. This research looks at statistical and deep learning approaches to assess anomalous activity. The deep learning methods assessed are isolation forest (IF), traditional autoencoder (AE), variational autoencoder (VAE), Kolmogorov Arnold Network (KAN), and a novel anchor-loss based autoencoder (Anchor AE). Each model is used to establish a baseline of on-orbit activity based on a five-year data sample. The primary investigation period focuses on the six months leading up to the invasion date of February 24, 2022. Additional analysis looks at RSO activity during an active combat period by sampling TLE data after the invasion date. The deep learning autoencoder models identify anomalies based on reconstruction errors that surpass a threshold sigma. To capture the nuance and unique characteristics of each RSO an individual model was trained for each observed space object. The research made an effort to prioritize explainability and interpretability of the model results thus each observation was assessed for anomalous behavior of the individual six orbital elements versus analyzing the input data as a single monolithic observation. The results demonstrate not only statistically significant anomalies of Russian RSO activity but also details anomalous findings to the individual orbital element.

Abstract: Diffusion-based talking head models generate high-quality, photorealistic videos but suffer from slow inference, limiting practical applications. Existing acceleration methods for general diffusion models fail to exploit the temporal and spatial redundancies unique to talking head generation. In this paper, we propose a task-specific framework addressing these inefficiencies through two key innovations. First, we introduce Lightning-fast Caching-based Parallel denoising prediction (LightningCP), caching static features to bypass most model layers in inference time. We also enable parallel prediction using cached features and estimated noisy latents as inputs, efficiently bypassing sequential sampling. Second, we propose Decoupled Foreground Attention (DFA) to further accelerate attention computations, exploiting the spatial decoupling in talking head videos to restrict attention to dynamic foreground regions. Additionally, we remove reference features in certain layers to bring extra speedup. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly improves inference speed while preserving video quality.

Abstract: Building a general model capable of analyzing human trajectories across different geographic regions and different tasks becomes an emergent yet important problem for various applications. However, existing works suffer from the generalization problem, \ie, they are either restricted to train for specific regions or only suitable for a few tasks. Given the recent advances of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we raise the question: can MLLMs reform current trajectory data mining and solve the problem? Nevertheless, due to the modality gap of trajectory, how to generate task-independent multimodal trajectory representations and how to adapt flexibly to different tasks remain the foundational challenges. In this paper, we propose \texttt{Traj-MLLM}}, which is the first general framework using MLLMs for trajectory data mining. By integrating multiview contexts, \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} transforms raw trajectories into interleaved image-text sequences while preserving key spatial-temporal characteristics, and directly utilizes the reasoning ability of MLLMs for trajectory analysis. Additionally, a prompt optimization method is proposed to finalize data-invariant prompts for task adaptation. Extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets show that \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $48.05\%$, $15.52\%$, $51.52\%$, $1.83\%$ on travel time estimation, mobility prediction, anomaly detection and transportation mode identification, respectively. \texttt{Traj-MLLM}} achieves these superior performances without requiring any training data or fine-tuning the MLLM backbones.

Abstract: Fire is a highly destructive disaster, but effective prevention can significantly reduce its likelihood of occurrence. When it happens, deploying emergency robots in fire-risk scenarios can help minimize the danger to human responders. However, current research on pre-disaster warnings and disaster-time rescue still faces significant challenges due to incomplete perception, inadequate fire situational awareness, and delayed response. To enhance intelligent perception and response planning for robots in fire scenarios, we first construct a knowledge graph (KG) by leveraging large language models (LLMs) to integrate fire domain knowledge derived from fire prevention guidelines and fire rescue task information from robotic emergency response documents. We then propose a new framework called Insights-on-Graph (IOG), which integrates the structured fire information of KG and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). The framework generates perception-driven risk graphs from real-time scene imagery to enable early fire risk detection and provide interpretable emergency responses for task module and robot component configuration based on the evolving risk situation. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments show that IOG has good applicability and practical application value in fire risk detection and rescue decision-making.

Abstract: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks, requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120 hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames. This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes, and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models. U2UData-2 can be found at https://fengtt42.github.io/U2UData-2/.

However, severe class imbalance, where normal instances vastly outnumber failure cases, remains a considerable challenge. While pre- and in-processing techniques have been widely studied, post-processing methods are largely unexplored. In this work, we present a direct comparison of pre-, in-, and post-processing approaches for class imbalance mitigation in failure detection and identification using an experimental dataset. For failure detection, post-processing methods-particularly Threshold Adjustment-achieve the highest F1 score improvement (up to 15.3%), while Random Under-Sampling provides the fastest inference. In failure identification, GenAI methods deliver the most substantial performance gains (up to 24.2%), whereas post-processing shows limited impact in multi-class settings. When class overlap is present and latency is critical, over-sampling methods such as the SMOTE are most effective; without latency constraints, Meta-Learning yields the best results. In low-overlap scenarios, Generative AI approaches provide the highest performance with minimal inference time.

Abstract: Generating realistic sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures is difficult due to the cubic memory scaling of voxel structures and moreover the significant class imbalance caused by sparsity. We introduce Scaffold Diffusion, a generative model designed for sparse multi-category 3D voxel structures. By treating voxels as tokens, Scaffold Diffusion uses a discrete diffusion language model to generate 3D voxel structures. We show that discrete diffusion language models can be extended beyond inherently sequential domains such as text to generate spatially coherent 3D structures. We evaluate on Minecraft house structures from the 3D-Craft dataset and demonstrate that, unlike prior baselines and an auto-regressive formulation, Scaffold Diffusion produces realistic and coherent structures even when trained on data with over 98% sparsity. We provide an interactive viewer where readers can visualize generated samples and the generation process. Our results highlight discrete diffusion as a promising framework for 3D sparse voxel generative modeling.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown growing potential in molecular sciences, but they often produce chemically inaccurate descriptions and struggle to recognize or justify potential errors. This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities. MolErr2Fix provides a focused benchmark for evaluating such capabilities and aims to support progress toward more reliable and chemically informed language models. All annotations and an accompanying evaluation API will be publicly released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: In recent years, AI-assisted IC design methods have demonstrated great potential, but the availability of circuit design data is extremely limited, especially in the public domain. The lack of circuit data has become the primary bottleneck in developing AI-assisted IC design methods. In this work, we make the first attempt, SynCircuit, to generate new synthetic circuits with valid functionalities in the HDL format. SynCircuit automatically generates synthetic data using a framework with three innovative steps: 1) We propose a customized diffusion-based generative model to resolve the Directed Cyclic Graph (DCG) generation task, which has not been well explored in the AI community. 2) To ensure our circuit is valid, we enforce the circuit constraints by refining the initial graph generation outputs. 3) The Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method further optimizes the logic redundancy in the generated graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SynCircuit can generate more realistic synthetic circuits and enhance ML model performance in downstream circuit design tasks.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) presents a significant yet persistent challenge in human-computer interaction. While deep learning has advanced spoken language processing, achieving high performance on limited datasets remains a critical hurdle. This paper confronts this issue by developing and evaluating a suite of machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for automated emotion classification in human speech. We demonstrate that by strategically employing transfer learning and innovative data augmentation techniques, our models can achieve impressive performance despite the constraints of a relatively small dataset. Our most effective model, a ResNet34 architecture, establishes a new performance benchmark on the combined RAVDESS and SAVEE datasets, attaining an accuracy of 66.7% and an F1 score of 0.631. These results underscore the substantial benefits of leveraging pre-trained models and data augmentation to overcome data scarcity, thereby paving the way for more robust and generalizable SER systems.

Abstract: Effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) relies upon accurately structured and semantically enriched information extracted from cybersecurity system logs. However, current methodologies often struggle to identify and interpret malicious events reliably and transparently, particularly in cases involving unstructured or ambiguous log entries. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that combines ontology-driven structured outputs with Large Language Models (LLMs), to build an Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent that improves the accuracy and explainability of information extraction from cybersecurity logs. Central to our approach is the integration of domain ontologies and SHACL-based constraints to guide the language model's output structure and enforce semantic validity over the resulting graph. Extracted information is organized into an ontology-enriched graph database, enabling future semantic analysis and querying. The design of our methodology is motivated by the analytical requirements associated with honeypot log data, which typically comprises predominantly malicious activity. While our case study illustrates the relevance of this scenario, the experimental evaluation is conducted using publicly available datasets. Results demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy in information extraction compared to traditional prompt-only approaches, with a deliberate focus on extraction quality rather than processing speed.

Abstract: Modern generative models risk overfitting and unintentionally memorizing rare training examples, which can be extracted by adversaries or inflate benchmark performance. We propose Generative Data Cartography (GenDataCarto), a data-centric framework that assigns each pretraining sample a difficulty score (early-epoch loss) and a memorization score (frequency of ``forget events''), then partitions examples into four quadrants to guide targeted pruning and up-/down-weighting. We prove that our memorization score lower-bounds classical influence under smoothness assumptions and that down-weighting high-memorization hotspots provably decreases the generalization gap via uniform stability bounds. Empirically, GenDataCarto reduces synthetic canary extraction success by over 40\% at just 10\% data pruning, while increasing validation perplexity by less than 0.5\%. These results demonstrate that principled data interventions can dramatically mitigate leakage with minimal cost to generative performance.

<title>Learning to Refine: Self-Refinement of Parallel Reasoning in LLMs</title>

Abstract: To further enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve complex, multi-step reasoning problems, test-time scaling (TTS) methods have gained widespread attention. Existing approaches such as Best-of-N and majority voting are limited as their performance depends on the quality of candidate responses, making them unable to produce a correct solution when all candidates are incorrect. Introducing an additional model to select the best response also incurs significant deployment costs. To this end, we introduce Generative Self-Refinement (GSR), a novel parallel test-time scaling framework where a unified model first generates a set of candidate responses in parallel and then performs self-refinement to synthesize a new superior solution based on a prompt consisting of the problem and these candidates. However, LLMs struggle to perform refinement effectively when prompted directly. Therefore, we design a hybrid training pipeline by jointly optimizing for two complementary objectives, solving problems directly and refining candidate responses. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five mathematical benchmarks. We further show that this learned self-refinement skill is a model-agnostic enhancement, robust across different model scales and generalizing to out-of-distribution reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The growing societal reliance on artificial intelligence necessitates robust frameworks for ensuring its security, accountability, and trustworthiness. This thesis addresses the complex interplay between privacy, verifiability, and auditability in modern AI, particularly in foundation models. It argues that technical solutions that integrate these elements are critical for responsible AI innovation. Drawing from international policy contributions and technical research to identify key risks in the AI pipeline, this work introduces novel technical solutions for critical privacy and verifiability challenges. Specifically, the research introduces techniques for enabling verifiable and auditable claims about AI systems using zero-knowledge cryptography; utilizing secure multi-party computation and trusted execution environments for auditable, confidential deployment of large language models and information retrieval; and implementing enhanced delegation mechanisms, credentialing systems, and access controls to secure interactions with autonomous and multi-agent AI systems. Synthesizing these technical advancements, this dissertation presents a cohesive perspective on balancing privacy, verifiability, and auditability in foundation model-based AI systems, offering practical blueprints for system designers and informing policy discussions on AI safety and governance.

Abstract: LSTM models used in current Machine Learning literature and applications, has a promising solution for permitting long term information using gating mechanisms that forget and reduce effect of current input information. However, even with this pipeline, they do not optimally focus on specific old index or long-term information. This paper elaborates upon input reordering approaches to prioritize certain input indices. Moreover, no LSTM based approach is found in the literature that examines weight normalization while choosing the right weight and exponent of Lp norms through main supervised loss function. In this paper, we find out which norm best finds relationship between weights to either smooth or sparsify them. Lastly, gates, as weighted representations of inputs and states, which control reduction-extent of current input versus previous inputs (~ state), are not nonlinearized enough (through a small FFNN). As analogous to attention mechanisms, gates easily filter current information to bold (emphasize on) past inputs. Nonlinearized gates can more easily tune up to peculiar nonlinearities of specific input in the past. This type of nonlinearization is not proposed in the literature, to the best of author's knowledge. The proposed approaches are implemented and compared with a simple LSTM to understand their performance in text classification tasks. The results show they improve accuracy of LSTM.

Abstract: Prompt injection attacks pose a significant challenge to the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications. While prompt-based detection offers a lightweight and interpretable defense strategy, its effectiveness has been hindered by the need for manual prompt engineering. To address this issue, we propose AEGIS , an Automated co-Evolutionary framework for Guarding prompt Injections Schema. Both attack and defense prompts are iteratively optimized against each other using a gradient-like natural language prompt optimization technique. This framework enables both attackers and defenders to autonomously evolve via a Textual Gradient Optimization (TGO) module, leveraging feedback from an LLM-guided evaluation loop. We evaluate our system on a real-world assignment grading dataset of prompt injection attacks and demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving superior robustness in both attack success and detection. Specifically, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 1.0, representing an improvement of 0.26 over the baseline. For detection, the true positive rate (TPR) improves by 0.23 compared to the previous best work, reaching 0.84, and the true negative rate (TNR) remains comparable at 0.89. Ablation studies confirm the importance of co-evolution, gradient buffering, and multi-objective optimization. We also confirm that this framework is effective in different LLMs. Our results highlight the promise of adversarial training as a scalable and effective approach for guarding prompt injections.

Abstract: Assessing spoken language is challenging, and quantifying pronunciation metrics for machine learning models is even harder. However, for the Holy Quran, this task is simplified by the rigorous recitation rules (tajweed) established by Muslim scholars, enabling highly effective assessment. Despite this advantage, the scarcity of high-quality annotated data remains a significant barrier.
  In this work, we bridge these gaps by introducing: (1) A 98% automated pipeline to produce high-quality Quranic datasets -- encompassing: Collection of recitations from expert reciters, Segmentation at pause points (waqf) using our fine-tuned wav2vec2-BERT model, Transcription of segments, Transcript verification via our novel Tasmeea algorithm; (2) 850+ hours of audio (~300K annotated utterances); (3) A novel ASR-based approach for pronunciation error detection, utilizing our custom Quran Phonetic Script (QPS) to encode Tajweed rules (unlike the IPA standard for Modern Standard Arabic). QPS uses a two-level script: (Phoneme level): Encodes Arabic letters with short/long vowels. (Sifa level): Encodes articulation characteristics of every phoneme. We further include comprehensive modeling with our novel multi-level CTC Model which achieved 0.16% average Phoneme Error Rate (PER) on the testset. We release all code, data, and models as open-source: https://obadx.github.io/prepare-quran-dataset/

Abstract: Transformer-based foundation models for Electrocardiograms (ECGs) have recently achieved impressive performance in many downstream applications. However, the internal representations of such models across layers have not been fully understood and exploited. An important question arises: Does the final layer of the pre-trained Transformer model, the \emph{de facto} representational layer, provide optimal performance for downstream tasks? Although our answer based on empirical and theoretical analyses for this question is negative, we propose a novel approach to leverage the representation diversity of the model's layers effectively. Specifically, we introduce a novel architecture called Post-pretraining Mixture-of-layers Aggregation (PMA), which enables a flexible combination of the layer-wise representations from the layer stack of a Transformer-based foundation model. We first pre-train the model from ECG signals using the 1-dimensional Vision Transformer (ViT) via masked modeling. In downstream applications, instead of relying solely on the last layer of the model, we employ a gating network to selectively fuse the representations from the pretrained model's layers, thereby enhancing representation power and improving performance of the downstream applications. In addition, we extend the proposed method to the pretraining stage by aggregating all representations through group-wise averaging before feeding them into the decoder-based Transformer.

Abstract: Modern optimization in experimental chemistry employs algorithmic search through black-box parameter spaces. Here we demonstrate that pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm. Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768 - 5,684 experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain systematically higher exploration entropy than BO across all datasets while achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails - suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories. Our findings establish that LLM-GO excels precisely where traditional methods struggle: complex categorical spaces requiring domain understanding rather than mathematical optimization.

Abstract: This study explores how virtual environments and artificial intelligence can enhance university students' learning experiences, with particular attention to the digital preferences of Generation Z. An experiment was conducted at the Faculty of Pedagogy, Humanities, and Social Sciences at University of Gyor, where Walter's Cube technology and a trained AI mediator were integrated into the instruction of ten philosophical topics. The curriculum was aligned with the official syllabus and enriched with visual content, quotations, and explanatory texts related to iconic figures in philosophy. A total of 77 first-year undergraduate students from full-time humanities and social sciences programs participated in the study. Following their end-of-semester offline written examination, students voluntarily completed a paper-based, anonymous ten-question test and provided feedback on the method's effectiveness. No sensitive personal data were collected, and the research was conducted with formal approval from the Faculty Dean. Descriptive statistics and inferential tests were applied to evaluate the impact of the virtual environment and AI mediation on learning outcomes. Results indicate that 80 percent of participants achieved good or excellent final exam grades, and the majority rated the virtual material as highly effective. Qualitative feedback emphasized increased motivation and deeper engagement, attributed to the immersive 3D presentation and interactive AI support. This research contributes to the advancement of digital pedagogy and suggests new directions for applying virtual and AI-based methods in higher education, particularly in disciplines where abstract reasoning and conceptual understanding are central.

Abstract: Human cognition is profoundly shaped by the environments in which it unfolds. Yet, it remains an open question whether learning and decision making can be explained as a principled adaptation to the statistical structure of real-world tasks. We introduce ecologically rational analysis, a computational framework that unifies the normative foundations of rational analysis with ecological grounding. Leveraging large language models to generate ecologically valid cognitive tasks at scale, and using meta-learning to derive rational models optimized for these environments, we develop a new class of learning algorithms: Ecologically Rational Meta-learned Inference (ERMI). ERMI internalizes the statistical regularities of naturalistic problem spaces and adapts flexibly to novel situations, without requiring hand-crafted heuristics or explicit parameter updates. We show that ERMI captures human behavior across 15 experiments spanning function learning, category learning, and decision making, outperforming several established cognitive models in trial-by-trial prediction. Our results suggest that much of human cognition may reflect adaptive alignment to the ecological structure of the problems we encounter in everyday life.

Abstract: The field of embodied AI (EAI) is rapidly advancing. Unlike virtual AI, EAI can exist in, learn from, reason about, and act in the physical world. Given recent innovations in large language and multimodal models, along with increasingly advanced and responsive hardware, EAI systems are rapidly growing in capabilities and operational domains. These advances present significant risks, including physical harm from malicious use, mass surveillance, and economic and societal disruption. However, these risks have been severely overlooked by policymakers. Existing policies, such as international standards for industrial robots or statutes governing autonomous vehicles, are insufficient to address the full range of concerns. While lawmakers are increasingly focused on AI, there is now an urgent need to extend and adapt existing frameworks to account for the unique risks of EAI. To help bridge this gap, this paper makes three contributions: first, we provide a foundational taxonomy of key physical, informational, economic, and social EAI risks. Secondly, we analyze policies in the US, EU, and UK to identify how existing frameworks address these risks and where these policies leave critical gaps. We conclude by offering concrete policy recommendations to address the coming wave of EAI innovation, including mandatory testing and certification for EAI systems, clarified liability frameworks, and forward-looking strategies to manage and prepare for transformative economic and societal impacts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel attack vector that leverages website cloaking techniques to compromise autonomous web-browsing agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). As these agents become more prevalent, their unique and often homogenous digital fingerprints - comprising browser attributes, automation framework signatures, and network characteristics - create a new, distinguishable class of web traffic. The attack exploits this fingerprintability. A malicious website can identify an incoming request as originating from an AI agent and dynamically serve a different, "cloaked" version of its content. While human users see a benign webpage, the agent is presented with a visually identical page embedded with hidden, malicious instructions, such as indirect prompt injections. This mechanism allows adversaries to hijack agent behavior, leading to data exfiltration, malware execution, or misinformation propagation, all while remaining completely invisible to human users and conventional security crawlers. This work formalizes the threat model, details the mechanics of agent fingerprinting and cloaking, and discusses the profound security implications for the future of agentic AI, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses against this stealthy and scalable attack.

Abstract: Existing AI Music composition tools are limited in generation duration, musical quality, and controllability. We introduce CoComposer, a multi-agent system that consists of five collaborating agents, each with a task based on the traditional music composition workflow. Using the AudioBox-Aesthetics system, we experimentally evaluate CoComposer on four compositional criteria. We test with three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3-0324, Gemini-2.5-Flash), and find (1) that CoComposer outperforms existing multi-agent LLM-based systems in music quality, and (2) compared to a single-agent system, in production complexity. Compared to non- LLM MusicLM, CoComposer has better interpretability and editability, although MusicLM still produces better music.

<title>LLM-based Triplet Extraction for Automated Ontology Generation in Software Engineering Standards</title>

Abstract: Ontologies have supported knowledge representation and whitebox reasoning for decades; thus, the automated ontology generation (AOG) plays a crucial role in scaling their use. Software engineering standards (SES) consist of long, unstructured text (with high noise) and paragraphs with domain-specific terms. In this setting, relation triple extraction (RTE), together with term extraction, constitutes the first stage toward AOG. This work proposes an open-source large language model (LLM)-assisted approach to RTE for SES. Instead of solely relying on prompt-engineering-based methods, this study promotes the use of LLMs as an aid in constructing ontologies and explores an effective AOG workflow that includes document segmentation, candidate term mining, LLM-based relation inference, term normalization, and cross-section alignment. Golden-standard benchmarks at three granularities are constructed and used to evaluate the ontology generated from the study. The results show that it is comparable and potentially superior to the OpenIE method of triple extraction.

Abstract: The rapid growth of statutory corpora and judicial decisions requires scalable legal AI systems capable of classification and retrieval over extremely long contexts. Transformer-based architectures (e.g., Longformer, DeBERTa) dominate current legal NLP benchmarks but struggle with quadratic attention costs, limiting efficiency and scalability. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of Mamba, a state-space model (SSM) with linear-time selective mechanisms, against leading transformer models for statutory classification and case law retrieval. We evaluate models on open-source legal corpora including LexGLUE, EUR-Lex, and ILDC, covering statutory tagging, judicial outcome prediction, and case retrieval tasks. Metrics include accuracy, recall at k, mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), alongside throughput measured in tokens per second and maximum context length. Results show that Mamba's linear scaling enables processing of legal documents several times longer than transformers, while maintaining or surpassing retrieval and classification performance. This study introduces a new legal NLP benchmark suite for long-context modeling, along with open-source code and datasets to support reproducibility. Our findings highlight trade-offs between state-space models and transformers, providing guidance for deploying scalable legal AI in statutory analysis, judicial decision support, and policy research.

Abstract: Generative AI (GAI) tools have seen rapid adoption in educational settings, yet their role in fostering critical thinking remains underexplored. While previous studies have examined GAI as a tutor for specific lessons or as a tool for completing assignments, few have addressed how students critically evaluate the accuracy and appropriateness of GAI-generated responses. This pilot study investigates students' ability to apply structured critical thinking when assessing Generative AI outputs in introductory Computational and Data Science courses. Given that GAI tools often produce contextually flawed or factually incorrect answers, we designed learning activities that require students to analyze, critique, and revise AI-generated solutions. Our findings offer initial insights into students' ability to engage critically with GAI content and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive studies in future semesters.

Abstract: Recent progress in deep learning has been driven by increasingly larger models. However, their computational and energy demands have grown proportionally, creating significant barriers to their deployment and to a wider adoption of deep learning technologies. This thesis investigates principled approximation methods for improving the efficiency of deep learning systems, with a particular focus on settings that involve discrete constraints and non-differentiability.
  We study three main approaches toward improved efficiency: architecture design, model compression, and optimization. For model compression, we propose novel approximations for pruning and quantization that frame the underlying discrete problem as continuous and differentiable, enabling gradient-based training of compression schemes alongside the model's parameters. These approximations allow for fine-grained sparsity and precision configurations, leading to highly compact models without significant fine-tuning. In the context of architecture design, we design an algorithm for neural architecture search that leverages parameter sharing across layers to efficiently explore implicitly recurrent architectures. Finally, we study adaptive optimization, revisiting theoretical properties of widely used methods and proposing an adaptive optimizer that allows for quick hyperparameter tuning.
  Our contributions center on tackling computationally hard problems via scalable and principled approximations. Experimental results on image classification, language modeling, and generative modeling tasks show that the proposed methods provide significant improvements in terms of training and inference efficiency while maintaining, or even improving, the model's performance.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) capable of performing a wide range of visual understanding tasks. While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance on standard natural images, their capabilities have not been thoroughly explored in cluttered datasets where there is complex environment having deformed shaped objects. In this work, we introduce a novel dataset specifically designed for waste classification in real-world scenarios, characterized by complex environments and deformed shaped objects. Along with this dataset, we present an in-depth evaluation approach to rigorously assess the robustness and accuracy of VLLMs. The introduced dataset and comprehensive analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of VLLMs under challenging conditions. Our findings highlight the critical need for further advancements in VLLM's robustness to perform better in complex environments. The dataset and code for our experiments will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Over the past decades, alongside advancements in natural language processing, significant attention has been paid to training models to automatically extract, understand, test, and generate hypotheses in open and scientific domains. However, interpretations of the term \emph{hypothesis} for various natural language understanding (NLU) tasks have migrated from traditional definitions in the natural, social, and formal sciences. Even within NLU, we observe differences defining hypotheses across literature. In this paper, we overview and delineate various definitions of hypothesis. Especially, we discern the nuances of definitions across recently published NLU tasks. We highlight the importance of well-structured and well-defined hypotheses, particularly as we move toward a machine-interpretable scholarly record.

Abstract: Rapid advancements in generative modeling have made synthetic audio generation easy, making speech-based services vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Consequently, there is a dire need for robust countermeasures more than ever. Existing solutions for deepfake detection are often criticized for lacking generalizability and fail drastically when applied to real-world data. This study proposes a novel method for generalizable spoofing detection leveraging non-semantic universal audio representations. Extensive experiments have been performed to find suitable non-semantic features using TRILL and TRILLsson models. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance on the in-domain test set while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on out-of-domain test sets. Notably, it demonstrates superior generalization on public-domain data, surpassing methods based on hand-crafted features, semantic embeddings, and end-to-end architectures.

Abstract: Recent advances in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting have enabled large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step reasoning. However, the explainability of such reasoning remains limited, with prior work primarily focusing on local token-level attribution, such that the high-level semantic roles of reasoning steps and their transitions remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a state-aware transition framework that abstracts CoT trajectories into structured latent dynamics. Specifically, to capture the evolving semantics of CoT reasoning, each reasoning step is represented via spectral analysis of token-level embeddings and clustered into semantically coherent latent states. To characterize the global structure of reasoning, we model their progression as a Markov chain, yielding a structured and interpretable view of the reasoning process. This abstraction supports a range of analyses, including semantic role identification, temporal pattern visualization, and consistency evaluation.

Abstract: Achieving human-like reasoning in deep learning models for complex tasks in unknown environments remains a critical challenge in embodied intelligence. While advanced vision-language models (VLMs) excel in static scene understanding, their limitations in spatio-temporal reasoning and adaptation to dynamic, open-set tasks like task-oriented navigation and embodied question answering (EQA) persist due to inadequate modeling of fine-grained spatio-temporal cues and physical world comprehension. To address this, we propose VEME, a novel cross-modal alignment method that enhances generalization in unseen scenes by learning an ego-centric, experience-centered world model. Our framework integrates three key components: (1) a cross-modal alignment framework bridging objects, spatial representations, and visual semantics with spatio-temporal cues to enhance VLM in-context learning; (2) a dynamic, implicit cognitive map activated by world embedding to enable task-relevant geometric-semantic memory recall; and (3) an instruction-based navigation and reasoning framework leveraging embodied priors for long-term planning and efficient exploration. By embedding geometry-aware spatio-temporal episodic experiences, our method significantly improves reasoning and planning in dynamic environments. Experimental results on VSI-Bench and VLN-CE demonstrate 1%-3% accuracy and exploration efficiency improvement compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast lesions that are difficult to classify preoperatively due to their radiological similarity to benign fibroadenomas. This often leads to unnecessary surgical excisions. To address this, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates breast ultrasound (BUS) images with structured clinical data to improve diagnostic accuracy. We developed a dual-branch neural network that extracts and fuses features from ultrasound images and patient metadata from 81 subjects with confirmed PTs. Class-aware sampling and subject-stratified 5-fold cross-validation were applied to prevent class imbalance and data leakage. The results show that our proposed multimodal method outperforms unimodal baselines in classifying benign versus borderline/malignant PTs. Among six image encoders, ConvNeXt and ResNet18 achieved the best performance in the multimodal setting, with AUC-ROC scores of 0.9427 and 0.9349, and F1-scores of 0.6720 and 0.7294, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal AI to serve as a non-invasive diagnostic tool, reducing unnecessary biopsies and improving clinical decision-making in breast tumor management.

Abstract: There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that leverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While early gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared to derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical due to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can approximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver efficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts, which can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples trajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled using a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a learned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables efficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator gradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation rollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and speed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality of standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other first-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark control tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot, across both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.

Abstract: As organizations face increasing pressure to understand their corporate and products' carbon footprints, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted calculation systems for footprinting are proliferating, but with widely varying levels of rigor and transparency. Standards and guidance have not kept pace with the technology; evaluation datasets are nascent; and statistical approaches to uncertainty analysis are not yet practical to apply to scaled systems. We present a set of criteria to validate AI-assisted systems that calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for products and materials. We implement a three-step approach: (1) Identification of needs and constraints, (2) Draft criteria development and (3) Refinements through pilots. The process identifies three use cases of AI applications: Case 1 focuses on AI-assisted mapping to existing datasets for corporate GHG accounting and product hotspotting, automating repetitive manual tasks while maintaining mapping quality. Case 2 addresses AI systems that generate complete product models for corporate decision-making, which require comprehensive validation of both component tasks and end-to-end performance. We discuss the outlook for Case 3 applications, systems that generate standards-compliant models. We find that credible AI systems can be built and that they should be validated using system-level evaluations rather than line-item review, with metrics such as benchmark performance, indications of data quality and uncertainty, and transparent documentation. This approach may be used as a foundation for practitioners, auditors, and standards bodies to evaluate AI-assisted environmental assessment tools. By establishing evaluation criteria that balance scalability with credibility requirements, our approach contributes to the field's efforts to develop appropriate standards for AI-assisted carbon footprinting systems.

Abstract: The proliferation of methods for modeling of human meaning-making constitutes a powerful class of instruments for the analysis of complex semiotic systems. However, the field lacks a general theoretical framework for describing these modeling practices across various model types in an apples-to-apples way. In this paper, we propose such a framework grounded in the semiotic theory of C. S. Peirce. We argue that such models measure latent symbol geometries, which can be understood as hypotheses about the complex of semiotic agencies underlying a symbolic dataset. Further, we argue that in contexts where a model's value cannot be straightforwardly captured by proxy measures of performance, models can instead be understood relationally, so that the particular interpretive lens of a model becomes visible through its contrast with other models. This forms the basis of a theory of model semantics in which models, and the modeling decisions that constitute them, are themselves treated as signs. In addition to proposing the framework, we illustrate its empirical use with a few brief examples and consider foundational questions and future directions enabled by the framework.

Abstract: Earthquake prediction has long been one of the most elusive challenges in science. Laboratory experiments and simulations suggest that failure precursors should exist, yet reliable signals have remained unobserved in real-world seismic records, leaving open the question of whether they are absent in nature or simply hidden within noise. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transformation that tracks energy differences between adjacent frequency bands, isolating subtle spectral changes linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied to both laboratory acoustic emission data and seismic records from seven major earthquakes (Mw 5.9-9.0), including the 2011 Tohoku and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals precursory signatures, arc-like trajectories and accelerations toward extrema, emerging hours to days before rupture. These features are robust across diverse tectonic settings, from induced seismicity and volcanic collapse to continental strike-slip and subduction megathrust earthquakes. Our findings demonstrate that hidden precursors are indeed encoded in ambient seismic noise, offering a pathway toward real-time fault monitoring and actionable short-term earthquake forecasting.

Abstract: The emergence of large-language models (LLMs) has enabled a new class of semantic data processing systems (SDPSs) to support declarative queries against unstructured documents. Existing SDPSs are, however, lacking a unified algebraic foundation, making their queries difficult to compose, reason, and optimize. We propose a new semantic algebra, SABER (Semantic Algebra Based on Extended Relational algebra), opening the possibility of semantic operations' logical plan construction, optimization, and formal correctness guarantees. We further propose to implement SABER in a SQL-compatible syntax so that it natively supports mixed structured/unstructured data processing. With SABER, we showcase the feasibility of providing a unified interface for existing SDPSs so that it can effectively mix and match any semantically-compatible operator implementation from any SDPS, greatly enhancing SABER's applicability for community contributions.

Abstract: Industrial computer vision systems often struggle with noise, material variability, and uncontrolled imaging conditions, limiting the effectiveness of classical edge detectors and handcrafted pipelines. In this work, we present a language-guided generative vision system for remnant contour detection in manufacturing, designed to achieve CAD-level precision. The system is organized into three stages: data acquisition and preprocessing, contour generation using a conditional GAN, and multimodal contour refinement through vision-language modeling, where standardized prompts are crafted in a human-in-the-loop process and applied through image-text guided synthesis. On proprietary FabTrack datasets, the proposed system improved contour fidelity, enhancing edge continuity and geometric alignment while reducing manual tracing. For the refinement stage, we benchmarked several vision-language models, including Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, OpenAI's GPT-image-1 integrated within a VLM-guided workflow, and open-source baselines. Under standardized conditions, GPT-image-1 consistently outperformed Gemini 2.0 Flash in both structural accuracy and perceptual quality. These findings demonstrate the promise of VLM-guided generative workflows for advancing industrial computer vision beyond the limitations of classical pipelines.

Abstract: We study the problem of opinion highlights generation from large volumes of user reviews, often exceeding thousands per entity, where existing methods either fail to scale or produce generic, one-size-fits-all summaries that overlook personalized needs. To tackle this, we introduce OpinioRAG, a scalable, training-free framework that combines RAG-based evidence retrieval with LLMs to efficiently produce tailored summaries. Additionally, we propose novel reference-free verification metrics designed for sentiment-rich domains, where accurately capturing opinions and sentiment alignment is essential. These metrics offer a fine-grained, context-sensitive assessment of factual consistency. To facilitate evaluation, we contribute the first large-scale dataset of long-form user reviews, comprising entities with over a thousand reviews each, paired with unbiased expert summaries and manually annotated queries. Through extensive experiments, we identify key challenges, provide actionable insights into improving systems, pave the way for future research, and position OpinioRAG as a robust framework for generating accurate, relevant, and structured summaries at scale.

Abstract: Satellite Communication (SatCom) networks represent a fundamental pillar in modern global connectivity, facilitating reliable service and extensive coverage across a plethora of applications. The expanding demand for high-bandwidth services and the proliferation of mega satellite constellations highlight the limitations of traditional exclusive satellite spectrum allocation approaches. Cognitive Radio (CR) leading to Cognitive Satellite (CogSat) networks through Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM), which enables the dynamic adaptability of radio equipment to environmental conditions for optimal performance, presents a promising solution for the emerging spectrum scarcity. In this survey, we explore the adaptation of intelligent DSM methodologies to SatCom, leveraging satellite network integrations. We discuss contributions and hurdles in regulations and standardizations in realizing intelligent DSM in SatCom, and deep dive into DSM techniques, which enable CogSat networks. Furthermore, we extensively evaluate and categorize state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) methods leveraged for DSM while exploring operational resilience and robustness of such integrations. In addition, performance evaluation metrics critical for adaptive resource management and system optimization in CogSat networks are thoroughly investigated. This survey also identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions in regulatory frameworks, network architectures, and intelligent spectrum management, paving the way for sustainable and scalable SatCom networks for enhanced global connectivity.

Abstract: We present the LLM ORDER BY operator as a logical abstraction and study its physical implementations within a unified evaluation framework. Our experiments show that no single approach is universally optimal, with effectiveness depending on query characteristics and data. We introduce three new designs: an agreement-based batch-size policy, a majority voting mechanism for pairwise sorting, and a two-way external merge sort adapted for LLMs. With extensive experiments, our agreement-based procedure is effective at determining batch size for value-based methods, the majority-voting mechanism consistently strengthens pairwise comparisons on GPT-4o, and external merge sort achieves high accuracy-efficiency trade-offs across datasets and models. We further observe a log-linear scaling between compute cost and ordering quality, offering the first step toward principled cost models for LLM powered data systems.

Abstract: Robots often struggle to generalize from a single demonstration due to the lack of a transferable and interpretable spatial representation. In this work, we introduce TReF-6, a method that infers a simplified, abstracted 6DoF Task-Relevant Frame from a single trajectory. Our approach identifies an influence point purely from the trajectory geometry to define the origin for a local frame, which serves as a reference for parameterizing a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP). This influence point captures the task's spatial structure, extending the standard DMP formulation beyond start-goal imitation. The inferred frame is semantically grounded via a vision-language model and localized in novel scenes by Grounded-SAM, enabling functionally consistent skill generalization. We validate TReF-6 in simulation and demonstrate robustness to trajectory noise. We further deploy an end-to-end pipeline on real-world manipulation tasks, showing that TReF-6 supports one-shot imitation learning that preserves task intent across diverse object configurations.

Abstract: Annealing-based neural samplers seek to amortize sampling from unnormalized distributions by training neural networks to transport a family of densities interpolating from source to target. A crucial design choice in the training phase of such samplers is the proposal distribution by which locations are generated at which to evaluate the loss. Previous work has obtained such a proposal distribution by combining a partially learned transport with annealed Langevin dynamics. However, isolated modes and other pathological properties of the annealing path imply that such proposals achieve insufficient exploration and thereby lower performance post training. To remedy this, we propose continuously tempered diffusion samplers, which leverage exploration techniques developed in the context of molecular dynamics to improve proposal distributions. Specifically, a family of distributions across different temperatures is introduced to lower energy barriers at higher temperatures and drive exploration at the lower temperature of interest. We empirically validate improved sampler performance driven by extended exploration. Code is available at https://github.com/eje24/ctds.

<title>A Framework for Task and Motion Planning based on Expanding AND/OR Graphs</title>

Abstract: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs, referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph, which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence, TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii) bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of challenges in the benchmarks.

Abstract: Navigating a flexible robotic endoscope (FRE) through the gastrointestinal tract is critical for surgical diagnosis and treatment. However, navigation in the dynamic stomach is particularly challenging because the FRE must learn to effectively use contact with the deformable stomach walls to reach target locations. To address this, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based Contact-Aided Navigation (CAN) strategy for FREs, leveraging contact force feedback to enhance motion stability and navigation precision. The training environment is established using a physics-based finite element method (FEM) simulation of a deformable stomach. Trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, our approach achieves high navigation success rates (within 3 mm error between the FRE's end-effector and target) and significantly outperforms baseline policies. In both static and dynamic stomach environments, the CAN agent achieved a 100% success rate with 1.6 mm average error, and it maintained an 85% success rate in challenging unseen scenarios with stronger external disturbances. These results validate that the DRL-based CAN strategy substantially enhances FRE navigation performance over prior methods.

<title>Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Endoluminal Navigation of Deformable Continuum Robots</title>

Abstract: Deformable continuum robots (DCRs) present unique planning challenges due to nonlinear deformation mechanics and partial state observability, violating the Markov assumptions of conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods. While Jacobian-based approaches offer theoretical foundations for rigid manipulators, their direct application to DCRs remains limited by time-varying kinematics and underactuated deformation dynamics. This paper proposes Jacobian Exploratory Dual-Phase RL (JEDP-RL), a framework that decomposes planning into phased Jacobian estimation and policy execution. During each training step, we first perform small-scale local exploratory actions to estimate the deformation Jacobian matrix, then augment the state representation with Jacobian features to restore approximate Markovianity. Extensive SOFA surgical dynamic simulations demonstrate JEDP-RL's three key advantages over proximal policy optimization (PPO) baselines: 1) Convergence speed: 3.2x faster policy convergence, 2) Navigation efficiency: requires 25% fewer steps to reach the target, and 3) Generalization ability: achieve 92% success rate under material property variations and achieve 83% (33% higher than PPO) success rate in the unseen tissue environment.

Abstract: Hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to enable effective decision-making over long timescales. Existing approaches, while promising, have yet to realize the benefits of large-scale training. In this work, we identify and solve several key challenges in scaling hierarchical RL to high-throughput environments. We propose Scalable Option Learning (SOL), a highly scalable hierarchical RL algorithm which achieves a 25x higher throughput compared to existing hierarchical methods. We train our hierarchical agents using 20 billion frames of experience on the complex game of NetHack, significantly surpassing flat agents and demonstrating positive scaling trends. We also validate our algorithm on MiniHack and Mujoco environments, showcasing its general applicability. Our code is open sourced at github.com/facebookresearch/sol.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) is known for its strong decision-making capabilities and has been widely applied in various real-world scenarios. However, with the increasing availability of offline datasets and the lack of well-designed online environments from human experts, the challenge of generalization in offline RL has become more prominent. Due to the limitations of offline data, RL agents trained solely on collected experiences often struggle to generalize to new tasks or environments. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-Driven Policy Diffusion (LLMDPD), a novel approach that enhances generalization in offline RL using task-specific prompts. Our method incorporates both text-based task descriptions and trajectory prompts to guide policy learning. We leverage a large language model (LLM) to process text-based prompts, utilizing its natural language understanding and extensive knowledge base to provide rich task-relevant context. Simultaneously, we encode trajectory prompts using a transformer model, capturing structured behavioral patterns within the underlying transition dynamics. These prompts serve as conditional inputs to a context-aware policy-level diffusion model, enabling the RL agent to generalize effectively to unseen tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMDPD outperforms state-of-the-art offline RL methods on unseen tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in improving generalization and adaptability in diverse settings.

Abstract: Intensive studies have been conducted in recent years to integrate neural networks with physics models to balance model accuracy and interpretability. One recently proposed approach, named Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL), is to use learning to estimate the residual between the physics model prediction and the ground truth. Numeral examples suggested that integrating such residual with physics models in PERL has three advantages: (1) a reduction in the number of required neural network parameters; (2) faster convergence rates; and (3) fewer training samples needed for the same computational precision. However, these numerical results lack theoretical justification and cannot be adequately explained.
  This paper aims to explain these advantages of PERL from a theoretical perspective. We investigate a general class of problems with Lipschitz continuity properties. By examining the relationships between the bounds to the loss function and residual learning structure, this study rigorously proves a set of theorems explaining the three advantages of PERL.
  Several numerical examples in the context of automated vehicle trajectory prediction are conducted to illustrate the proposed theorems. The results confirm that, even with significantly fewer training samples, PERL consistently achieves higher accuracy than a pure neural network. These results demonstrate the practical value of PERL in real world autonomous driving applications where corner case data are costly or hard to obtain. PERL therefore improves predictive performance while reducing the amount of data required.

Abstract: Deep models trained on a single source domain often fail catastrophically under distribution shifts, a critical challenge in Single Domain Generalization (SDG). While existing methods focus on augmenting source data or learning invariant features, they neglect a readily available resource: textual descriptions of the target deployment environment. We propose Target-Oriented Single Domain Generalization (TO-SDG), a novel problem setup that leverages the textual description of the target domain, without requiring any target data, to guide model generalization. To address TO-SDG, we introduce Spectral TARget Alignment (STAR), a lightweight module that injects target semantics into source features by exploiting visual-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP. STAR uses a target-anchored subspace derived from the text embedding of the target description to recenter image features toward the deployment domain, then utilizes spectral projection to retain directions aligned with target cues while discarding source-specific noise. Moreover, we use a vision-language distillation to align backbone features with VLM's semantic geometry. STAR further employs feature-space Mixup to ensure smooth transitions between source and target-oriented representations. Experiments across various image classification and object detection benchmarks demonstrate STAR's superiority. This work establishes that minimal textual metadata, which is a practical and often overlooked resource, significantly enhances generalization under severe data constraints, opening new avenues for deploying robust models in target environments with unseen data.

Abstract: Air pollution monitoring in resource-constrained regions remains challenging due to sparse sensor deployment and limited infrastructure. This work introduces AQFusionNet, a multimodal deep learning framework for robust Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction. The framework integrates ground-level atmospheric imagery with pollutant concentration data using lightweight CNN backbones (MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNet-B0). Visual and sensor features are combined through semantically aligned embedding spaces, enabling accurate and efficient prediction. Experiments on more than 8,000 samples from India and Nepal demonstrate that AQFusionNet consistently outperforms unimodal baselines, achieving up to 92.02% classification accuracy and an RMSE of 7.70 with the EfficientNet-B0 backbone. The model delivers an 18.5% improvement over single-modality approaches while maintaining low computational overhead, making it suitable for deployment on edge devices. AQFusionNet provides a scalable and practical solution for AQI monitoring in infrastructure-limited environments, offering robust predictive capability even under partial sensor availability.

Abstract: Surgical video understanding is crucial for facilitating Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) systems. Despite significant progress in existing studies, two major limitations persist, including inadequate visual content perception and insufficient temporal awareness in surgical videos, and hinder the development of versatile CAS solutions. In this work, we propose the SurgLLM framework, an effective large multimodal model tailored for versatile surgical video understanding tasks with enhanced spatial focus and temporal awareness. Specifically, to empower the spatial focus of surgical videos, we first devise Surgical Context-aware Multimodal Pretraining (Surg-Pretrain) for the video encoder of SurgLLM, by performing instrument-centric Masked Video Reconstruction (MV-Recon) and subsequent multimodal alignment. To incorporate surgical temporal knowledge into SurgLLM, we further propose Temporal-aware Multimodal Tuning (TM-Tuning) to enhance temporal reasoning with interleaved multimodal embeddings. Moreover, to accommodate various understanding tasks of surgical videos without conflicts, we devise a Surgical Task Dynamic Ensemble to efficiently triage a query with optimal learnable parameters in our SurgLLM. Extensive experiments performed on diverse surgical video understanding tasks, including captioning, general VQA, and temporal VQA, demonstrate significant improvements over the state-of-the-art approaches, validating the effectiveness of our SurgLLM in versatile surgical video understanding.

<title>Activation Steering Meets Preference Optimization: Defense Against Jailbreaks in Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in integrating visual and textual information for understanding and reasoning, but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. While activation steering has emerged as a promising defence, existing approaches often rely on task-specific contrastive prompts to extract harmful directions, which exhibit suboptimal performance and can degrade visual grounding performance. To address these limitations, we propose \textit{Sequence-Level Preference Optimization} for VLM (\textit{SPO-VLM}), a novel two-stage defense framework that combines activation-level intervention with policy-level optimization to enhance model robustness. In \textit{Stage I}, we compute adaptive layer-specific steering vectors from diverse data sources, enabling generalized suppression of harmful behaviors during inference. In \textit{Stage II}, we refine these steering vectors through a sequence-level preference optimization process. This stage integrates automated toxicity assessment, as well as visual-consistency rewards based on caption-image alignment, to achieve safe and semantically grounded text generation. The two-stage structure of SPO-VLM balances efficiency and effectiveness by combining a lightweight mitigation foundation in Stage I with deeper policy refinement in Stage II. Extensive experiments shown SPO-VLM enhances safety against attacks via activation steering and preference optimization, while maintaining strong performance on benign tasks without compromising visual understanding capabilities. We will release our code, model weights, and evaluation toolkit to support reproducibility and future research. \textcolor{red}{Warning: This paper may contain examples of offensive or harmful text and images.}

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to go beyond simple factual queries toward Deep Research-tasks that require decomposing questions into sub-problems, coordinating multi-step reasoning, and synthesizing evidence from diverse sources. We formalize Deep Research tasks with verifiable answers as Hierarchical Constraint Satisfaction Problems (HCSPs), which are fundamentally different from single-constraint, multi-hop, or flat CSP formulations. However, existing benchmarks (e.g., Natural Questions, HotpotQA) fail to capture this complexity, while recent synthetic datasets often introduce shortcut reasoning, knowledge leakage, or lack sufficient structural depth. To address this gap, we introduce InfoSeek, a scalable framework for synthesizing complex Deep Research tasks. InfoSeek uses a dual-agent system to recursively build a Research Tree from large-scale webpages, blurring intermediate nodes into valid sub-problems, and converting these trees into natural language questions that require traversing the full hierarchy. It also enables rapid scaling, yielding over 50K training examples, a curated test set, and reasoning trajectories generated via reject sampling. Experiments show that models trained on InfoSeek consistently outperform strong baselines. On a challenging benchmark BrowseComp-Plus, 3B LLMs optimized with InfoSeek surpass much larger 32B models and lightweight commercial APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Flash), while achieving performance comparable to stronger APIs (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro). By preserving meta-information such as intermediate steps and retrieval labels, InfoSeek further supports advanced optimization strategies, including compound reward design and trajectory-level exploration. We provide our codes and datasets in \href{https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/InfoSeek}{this repository}.

Abstract: This paper studies the vulnerability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to adversarial attacks on node features and graph structure. Various methods have implemented adversarial training to augment graph data, aiming to bolster the robustness and generalization of GNNs. These methods typically involve applying perturbations to the node feature, weights, or graph structure and subsequently minimizing the loss by learning more robust graph model parameters under the adversarial perturbations. Despite the effectiveness of adversarial training in enhancing GNNs' robustness and generalization abilities, its application has been largely confined to specific datasets and GNN types. In this paper, we propose a novel method, PerturbEmbedding, that integrates adversarial perturbation and training, enhancing GNNs' resilience to such attacks and improving their generalization ability. PerturbEmbedding performs perturbation operations directly on every hidden embedding of GNNs and provides a unified framework for most existing perturbation strategies/methods. We also offer a unified perspective on the forms of perturbations, namely random and adversarial perturbations. Through experiments on various datasets using different backbone models, we demonstrate that PerturbEmbedding significantly improves both the robustness and generalization abilities of GNNs, outperforming existing methods. The rejection of both random (non-targeted) and adversarial (targeted) perturbations further enhances the backbone model's performance.

<title>Beyond Negative Transfer: Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion for Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation</title>

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) leverages user behaviors across domains to enhance recommendation quality. However, naive aggregation of sequential signals can introduce conflicting domain-specific preferences, leading to negative transfer. While Sequential Recommendation (SR) already suffers from noisy behaviors such as misclicks and impulsive actions, CDSR further amplifies this issue due to domain heterogeneity arising from diverse item types and user intents. The core challenge is disentangling three intertwined signals: domain-invariant preferences, domain-specific preferences, and noise. Diffusion Models (DMs) offer a generative denoising framework well-suited for disentangling complex user preferences and enhancing robustness to noise. Their iterative refinement process enables gradual denoising, making them effective at capturing subtle preference signals. However, existing applications in recommendation face notable limitations: sequential DMs often conflate shared and domain-specific preferences, while cross-domain collaborative filtering DMs neglect temporal dynamics, limiting their ability to model evolving user preferences. To bridge these gaps, we propose \textbf{DPG-Diff}, a novel Disentangled Preference-Guided Diffusion Model, the first diffusion-based approach tailored for CDSR, to or best knowledge. DPG-Diff decomposes user preferences into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, which jointly guide the reverse diffusion process. This disentangled guidance enables robust cross-domain knowledge transfer, mitigates negative transfer, and filters sequential noise. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DPG-Diff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Gradient-based adversarial prompting, such as the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) algorithm, has emerged as a powerful method for jailbreaking large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we present a systematic appraisal of GCG and its annealing-augmented variant, T-GCG, across open-source LLMs of varying scales. Using Qwen2.5-0.5B, LLaMA-3.2-1B, and GPT-OSS-20B, we evaluate attack effectiveness on both safety-oriented prompts (AdvBench) and reasoning-intensive coding prompts. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) attack success rates (ASR) decrease with model size, reflecting the increasing complexity and non-convexity of larger models' loss landscapes; (2) prefix-based heuristics substantially overestimate attack effectiveness compared to GPT-4o semantic judgments, which provide a stricter and more realistic evaluation; and (3) coding-related prompts are significantly more vulnerable than adversarial safety prompts, suggesting that reasoning itself can be exploited as an attack vector. In addition, preliminary results with T-GCG show that simulated annealing can diversify adversarial search and achieve competitive ASR under prefix evaluation, though its benefits under semantic judgment remain limited. Together, these findings highlight the scalability limits of GCG, expose overlooked vulnerabilities in reasoning tasks, and motivate further development of annealing-inspired strategies for more robust adversarial evaluation.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos that capture the entire surroundings are employed in a variety of fields such as VR applications and remote sensing. However, their wide field of view often causes unwanted objects to appear in the videos. This problem can be addressed by video inpainting, which enables the natural removal of such objects while preserving both spatial and temporal consistency. Nevertheless, most existing methods assume processing ordinary videos with a narrow field of view and do not tackle the distortion in equirectangular projection of omnidirectional videos. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model for omnidirectional video inpainting, called Distortion-Aware Omnidirectional Video Inpainting (DAOVI). DAOVI introduces a module that evaluates temporal motion information in the image space considering geodesic distance, as well as a depth-aware feature propagation module in the feature space that is designed to address the geometric distortion inherent to omnidirectional videos. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy, accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the positive societal contributions of AI technologies.

Abstract: Subgraph Federated Learning (FL) aims to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) across distributed private subgraphs, but it suffers from severe data heterogeneity. To mitigate data heterogeneity, weighted model aggregation personalizes each local GNN by assigning larger weights to parameters from clients with similar subgraph characteristics inferred from their current model states. However, the sparse and biased subgraphs often trigger rapid overfitting, causing the estimated client similarity matrix to stagnate or even collapse. As a result, aggregation loses effectiveness as clients reinforce their own biases instead of exploiting diverse knowledge otherwise available. To this end, we propose a novel personalized subgraph FL framework called Curriculum guided personalized sUbgraph Federated Learning (CUFL). On the client side, CUFL adopts Curriculum Learning (CL) that adaptively selects edges for training according to their reconstruction scores, exposing each GNN first to easier, generic cross-client substructures and only later to harder, client-specific ones. This paced exposure prevents early overfitting to biased patterns and enables gradual personalization. By regulating personalization, the curriculum also reshapes server aggregation from exchanging generic knowledge to propagating client-specific knowledge. Further, CUFL improves weighted aggregation by estimating client similarity using fine-grained structural indicators reconstructed on a random reference graph.

Abstract: In the digital age, people often turn to the Internet in search of medical advice and recommendations. With the increasing volume of online content, it has become difficult to distinguish reliable sources from misleading information. Similarly, millions of medical studies are published every year, making it challenging for researchers to keep track of the latest scientific findings. These evolving studies can reach differing conclusions, which is not reflected in traditional search tools. To address these challenges, we introduce MedSEBA, an interactive AI-powered system for synthesizing evidence-based answers to medical questions. It utilizes the power of Large Language Models to generate coherent and expressive answers, but grounds them in trustworthy medical studies dynamically retrieved from the research database PubMed. The answers consist of key points and arguments, which can be traced back to respective studies. Notably, the platform also provides an overview of the extent to which the most relevant studies support or refute the given medical claim, and a visualization of how the research consensus evolved through time. Our user study revealed that medical experts and lay users find the system usable and helpful, and the provided answers trustworthy and informative. This makes the system well-suited for both everyday health questions and advanced research insights.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) for open-ended language generation remains a critical yet underexplored challenge, especially under black-box constraints where internal model signals are inaccessible. In this paper, we introduce Token-Entropy Conformal Prediction (TECP), a novel framework that leverages token-level entropy as a logit-free, reference-free uncertainty measure and integrates it into a split conformal prediction (CP) pipeline to construct prediction sets with formal coverage guarantees. Unlike existing approaches that rely on semantic consistency heuristics or white-box features, TECP directly estimates epistemic uncertainty from the token entropy structure of sampled generations and calibrates uncertainty thresholds via CP quantiles to ensure provable error control. Empirical evaluations across six large language models and two benchmarks (CoQA and TriviaQA) demonstrate that TECP consistently achieves reliable coverage and compact prediction sets, outperforming prior self-consistency-based UQ methods. Our method provides a principled and efficient solution for trustworthy generation in black-box LLM settings.

Abstract: This thesis introduces "Embodied Spatial Intelligence" to address the challenge of creating robots that can perceive and act in the real world based on natural language instructions. To bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and physical embodiment, we present contributions on two fronts: scene representation and spatial reasoning. For perception, we develop robust, scalable, and accurate scene representations using implicit neural models, with contributions in self-supervised camera calibration, high-fidelity depth field generation, and large-scale reconstruction. For spatial reasoning, we enhance the spatial capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel navigation benchmark, a method for grounding language in 3D, and a state-feedback mechanism to improve long-horizon decision-making. This work lays a foundation for robots that can robustly perceive their surroundings and intelligently act upon complex, language-based commands.

Abstract: The escalating sophistication of malware necessitates robust detection mechanisms that generalize across diverse data sources. Traditional single-dataset models struggle with cross-domain generalization and often incur high computational costs. This paper presents a novel, lightweight framework for malware detection that employs probability-level fusion across three distinct datasets: EMBER (static features), API Call Sequences (behavioral features), and CIC Obfuscated Memory (memory patterns). Our method trains individual LightGBM classifiers on each dataset, selects top predictive features to ensure efficiency, and fuses their prediction probabilities using optimized weights determined via grid search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fusion approach achieves a macro F1-score of 0.823 on a cross-domain validation set, significantly outperforming individual models and providing superior generalization. The framework maintains low computational overhead, making it suitable for real-time deployment, and all code and data are provided for full reproducibility.

<title>A Novel Method to Determine Total Oxidant Concentration Produced by Non-Thermal Plasma Based on Image Processing and Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: Accurate determination of total oxidant concentration ([Ox]_{tot}) in non-thermal plasma (NTP)-treated aqueous systems remains a critical challenge due to the transient nature of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the subjectivity of conventional titration methods used for [Ox]_{tot} determination. This study introduces a novel, color-based computer analysis (CBCA) method that integrates advanced image processing with machine learning (ML) to quantify colorimetric shifts in potassium iodide (KI) solutions during oxidation. First, a custom-built visual data acquisition system captured high-resolution video of the color transitions in a KI solution during oxidation with an NTP system. The change in [Ox]_{tot} during the experiments was monitored with a standard titrimetric method. Second, the captured frames were processed using a robust image processing pipeline to extract RGB, HSV, and Lab color features. The extracted features were statistically evaluated, and the results revealed strong linear correlations with the measured [Ox]_{tot} values, particularly in the saturation (HSV), a and b (Lab), and blue (RGB) channels. Subsequently, the [Ox]_{tot} measurements and the extracted color features were used to train and validate five ML models. Among them, linear regression and gradient boosting models achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R^2 > 0.990). It was also found that reducing the feature set from nine to four resulted in comparable performance with improved prediction efficiency, especially for gradient boosting. Finally, comparison of the model predictions with real titration measurements revealed that the CBCA system successfully predicts the [Ox]_{tot} in KI solution with high accuracy (R^2 > 0.998) even with a reduced number of features.

Abstract: This report investigates approaches for prompting a tool-augmented large language model (LLM) to act as a role-playing dialogue agent in the API track of the Commonsense Persona-grounded Dialogue Challenge (CPDC) 2025. In this setting, dialogue agents often produce overly long in-character responses (over-speaking) while failing to use tools effectively according to the persona (under-acting), such as generating function calls that do not exist or making unnecessary tool calls before answering. We explore four prompting approaches to address these issues: 1) basic role prompting, 2) human-crafted role prompting, 3) automatic prompt optimization (APO), and 4) rule-based role prompting. The rule-based role prompting (RRP) approach achieved the best performance through two novel techniques--character-card/scene-contract design and strict enforcement of function calling--which led to an overall score of 0.571, improving on the zero-shot baseline score of 0.519. These findings demonstrate that RRP design can substantially improve the effectiveness and reliability of role-playing dialogue agents compared with more elaborate methods such as APO. To support future efforts in developing persona prompts, we are open-sourcing all of our best-performing prompts and the APO tool. Source code is available at https://github.com/scb-10x/apo.

Abstract: Multimodal reward models (MRMs) play a crucial role in the training, inference, and evaluation of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by assessing response quality. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating MRMs in the video domain suffer from a limited number and diversity of questions, a lack of comprehensive evaluation dimensions, and inadequate evaluation of diverse types of MRMs. To address these gaps, we introduce VideoRewardBench, the first comprehensive benchmark covering four core aspects of video understanding: perception, knowledge, reasoning, and safety. Through our AI-assisted data pipeline, we curate a high-quality preference dataset of 1,563 annotated samples, including 1,482 unique videos and 1,559 distinct questions--15 times the number found in the most question-rich prior benchmark. Each sample is a triplet consisting of a video-text prompt, a chosen response, and a rejected response. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 28 multimodal reward models spanning three categories: generative, discriminative, and semi-scalar. Results show that even the top-performing model GPT-4o achieves only 57.0% overall accuracy, and the state-of-the-art open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-72B reaches merely 53.3%. Our analysis further reveals three key insights: (i) MRMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) do not necessarily exhibit stronger cross-modal generalization than those trained without RL; (ii) except for discriminative MRMs, other types of MRMs across varying model capacities can benefit from inference-time scaling; and (iii) variations in input video frame count have different effects on different types of MRMs. We believe VideoRewardBench offers a challenging and valuable benchmark for advancing the evaluation and development of MRMs in the video domain.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of video data in various complex scenarios, quickly retrieving group activities has become an urgent problem. However, many tasks can only retrieve videos focusing on an entire video, not the activity granularity. To solve this problem, we propose a new STVH (spatiotemporal interleaved video hashing) technique for the first time. Through a unified framework, the STVH simultaneously models individual object dynamics and group interactions, capturing the spatiotemporal evolution on both group visual features and positional features. Moreover, in real-life video retrieval scenarios, it may sometimes require activity features, while at other times, it may require visual features of objects. We then further propose a novel M-STVH (multi-focused spatiotemporal video hashing) as an enhanced version to handle this difficult task. The advanced method incorporates hierarchical feature integration through multi-focused representation learning, allowing the model to jointly focus on activity semantics features and object visual features. We conducted comparative experiments on publicly available datasets, and both STVH and M-STVH can achieve excellent results.

Abstract: Evaluating long-form responses to research queries heavily relies on expert annotators, restricting attention to areas like AI where researchers can conveniently enlist colleagues. Yet, research expertise is widespread: survey articles synthesize knowledge distributed across the literature. We introduce ResearchQA, a resource for evaluating LLM systems by distilling survey articles from 75 research fields into 21K queries and 160K rubric items. Each rubric, derived jointly with queries from survey sections, lists query-specific answer evaluation criteria, i.e., citing papers, making explanations, and describing limitations. Assessments by 31 Ph.D. annotators in 8 fields indicate 96% of queries support Ph.D. information needs and 87% of rubric items should be addressed in system responses by a sentence or more. Using our rubrics, we are able to construct an automatic pairwise judge obtaining 74% agreement with expert judgments. We leverage ResearchQA to analyze competency gaps in 18 systems in over 7.6K pairwise evaluations. No parametric or retrieval-augmented system we evaluate exceeds 70% on covering rubric items, and the highest-ranking agentic system shows 75% coverage. Error analysis reveals that the highest-ranking system fully addresses less than 11% of citation rubric items, 48% of limitation items, and 49% of comparison items. We release our data to facilitate more comprehensive multi-field evaluations.

Abstract: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and reliable Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning. Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points, whereas SVCD continuously checks for collisions along the entire trajectory. Existing SVCD methods typically face a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, limiting practical use. In this paper, we introduce NeuralSVCD, a novel neural encoder-decoder architecture tailored to overcome this trade-off. Our approach leverages shape locality and temporal locality through distributed geometric representations and temporal optimization. This enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive experiments show that NeuralSVCD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SVCD methods in terms of both collision detection accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating its robust applicability across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion-based Image Editing has achieved significant success in recent years. However, it remains challenging to achieve high-quality image editing while maintaining the background similarity without sacrificing speed or memory efficiency. In this work, we introduce LatentEdit, an adaptive latent fusion framework that dynamically combines the current latent code with a reference latent code inverted from the source image. By selectively preserving source features in high-similarity, semantically important regions while generating target content in other regions guided by the target prompt, LatentEdit enables fine-grained, controllable editing. Critically, the method requires no internal model modifications or complex attention mechanisms, offering a lightweight, plug-and-play solution compatible with both UNet-based and DiT-based architectures. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench dataset demonstrate that our proposed LatentEdit achieves an optimal balance between fidelity and editability, outperforming the state-of-the-art method even in 8-15 steps. Additionally, its inversion-free variant further halves the number of neural function evaluations and eliminates the need for storing any intermediate variables, substantially enhancing real-time deployment efficiency.

Abstract: Auditability is defined as the capacity of AI systems to be independently assessed for compliance with ethical, legal, and technical standards throughout their lifecycle. The chapter explores how auditability is being formalized through emerging regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, which mandate documentation, risk assessments, and governance structures. It analyzes the diverse challenges facing AI auditability, including technical opacity, inconsistent documentation practices, lack of standardized audit tools and metrics, and conflicting principles within existing responsible AI frameworks. The discussion highlights the need for clear guidelines, harmonized international regulations, and robust socio-technical methodologies to operationalize auditability at scale. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of multi-stakeholder collaboration and auditor empowerment in building an effective AI audit ecosystem. It argues that auditability must be embedded in AI development practices and governance infrastructures to ensure that AI systems are not only functional but also ethically and legally aligned.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive potential in various practical applications. However, long context inference poses a significant challenge due to the enormous memory requirements of the key-value (KV) cache, which can scale to multiple gigabytes as sequence length and batch size increase. In this paper, we present KVComp, a generic and efficient KV cache management framework optimized for long-text generation that synergistically works with both latency-critical and throughput-critical inference systems. KVComp employs novel lossy compression techniques specifically designed for KV cache data characteristics, featuring careful co-design of compression algorithms and system architecture. Our approach maintains compatibility with the growing nature of KV cache while preserving high computational efficiency. Experimental results show that KVComp achieves on average 47\% and up to 83\% higher memory reduction rate compared to existing methods with little/no model accuracy degradation. Furthermore, KVComp achieves extremely high execution throughput, effectively reducing decompression overhead and, in some cases, even accelerating the matrix-vector multiplication operation and outperform cuBLAS-based attention kernels with less data movement.

Abstract: We investigate how to calculate Kaplan-Meier survival curves across multiple health-care jurisdictions while protecting patient privacy with node-level differential privacy. Each site discloses its curve only once, adding Laplace noise whose scale is determined by the length of the common time grid; the server then averages the noisy curves, so the overall privacy budget remains unchanged. We benchmark four one-shot smoothing techniques: Discrete Cosine Transform, Haar Wavelet shrinkage, adaptive Total-Variation denoising, and a parametric Weibull fit on the NCCTG lung-cancer cohort under five privacy levels and three partition scenarios (uniform, moderately skewed, highly imbalanced). Total-Variation gives the best mean accuracy, whereas the frequency-domain smoothers offer stronger worst-case robustness and the Weibull model shows the most stable behaviour at the strictest privacy setting. Across all methods the released curves keep the empirical log-rank type-I error below fifteen percent for privacy budgets of 0.5 and higher, demonstrating that clinically useful survival information can be shared without iterative training or heavy cryptography.

Abstract: We introduce TimeCopilot, the first open-source agentic framework for forecasting that combines multiple Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) with Large Language Models (LLMs) through a single unified API. TimeCopilot automates the forecasting pipeline: feature analysis, model selection, cross-validation, and forecast generation, while providing natural language explanations and supporting direct queries about the future. The framework is LLM-agnostic, compatible with both commercial and open-source models, and supports ensembles across diverse forecasting families. Results on the large-scale GIFT-Eval benchmark show that TimeCopilot achieves state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting performance at low cost. Our framework provides a practical foundation for reproducible, explainable, and accessible agentic forecasting systems.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.

Abstract: The ionosphere critically influences Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), satellite communications, and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operations, yet accurate prediction of its variability remains challenging due to nonlinear couplings between solar, geomagnetic, and thermospheric drivers. Total Electron Content (TEC), a key ionospheric parameter, is derived from GNSS observations, but its reliable forecasting is limited by the sparse nature of global measurements and the limited accuracy of empirical models, especially during strong space weather conditions. In this work, we present a machine learning framework for ionospheric TEC forecasting that leverages Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to predict sparse ionosphere data. Our approach accommodates heterogeneous input sources, including solar irradiance, geomagnetic indices, and GNSS-derived vertical TEC, and applies preprocessing and temporal alignment strategies. Experiments spanning 2010-2025 demonstrate that the model achieves robust predictions up to 24 hours ahead, with root mean square errors as low as 3.33 TECU. Results highlight that solar EUV irradiance provides the strongest predictive signals. Beyond forecasting accuracy, the framework offers interpretability through attention-based analysis, supporting both operational applications and scientific discovery. To encourage reproducibility and community-driven development, we release the full implementation as the open-source toolkit \texttt{ionopy}.

<title>Enabling Trustworthy Federated Learning via Remote Attestation for Mitigating Byzantine Threats</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has gained significant attention for its privacy-preserving capabilities, enabling distributed devices to collaboratively train a global model without sharing raw data. However, its distributed nature forces the central server to blindly trust the local training process and aggregate uncertain model updates, making it susceptible to Byzantine attacks from malicious participants, especially in mission-critical scenarios. Detecting such attacks is challenging due to the diverse knowledge across clients, where variations in model updates may stem from benign factors, such as non-IID data, rather than adversarial behavior. Existing data-driven defenses struggle to distinguish malicious updates from natural variations, leading to high false positive rates and poor filtering performance.
  To address this challenge, we propose Sentinel, a remote attestation (RA)-based scheme for FL systems that regains client-side transparency and mitigates Byzantine attacks from a system security perspective. Our system employs code instrumentation to track control-flow and monitor critical variables in the local training process. Additionally, we utilize a trusted training recorder within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to generate an attestation report, which is cryptographically signed and securely transmitted to the server. Upon verification, the server ensures that legitimate client training processes remain free from program behavior violation or data manipulation, allowing only trusted model updates to be aggregated into the global model. Experimental results on IoT devices demonstrate that Sentinel ensures the trustworthiness of the local training integrity with low runtime and memory overhead.

Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful and widely used tools for molecular structure elucidation in organic chemistry. However, the interpretation of NMR spectra to determine unknown molecular structures remains a labor-intensive and expertise-dependent process, particularly for complex or novel compounds. Although recent methods have been proposed for molecular structure elucidation, they often underperform in real-world applications due to inherent algorithmic limitations and limited high-quality data. Here, we present NMR-Solver, a practical and interpretable framework for the automated determination of small organic molecule structures from $^1$H and $^{13}$C NMR spectra. Our method introduces an automated framework for molecular structure elucidation, integrating large-scale spectral matching with physics-guided fragment-based optimization that exploits atomic-level structure-spectrum relationships in NMR. We evaluate NMR-Solver on simulated benchmarks, curated experimental data from the literature, and real-world experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization, robustness, and practical utility in challenging, real-life scenarios. NMR-Solver unifies computational NMR analysis, deep learning, and interpretable chemical reasoning into a coherent system. By incorporating the physical principles of NMR into molecular optimization, it enables scalable, automated, and chemically meaningful molecular identification, establishing a generalizable paradigm for solving inverse problems in molecular science.

Abstract: The rapid digital transformation of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening skill gaps, especially for older workers. With growing emphasis on STEM skills such as robotics, automation, artificial intelligence (AI), and security, large-scale re-skilling and up-skilling are required. Training programs must address diverse backgrounds, learning styles, and motivations to improve persistence and success, while ensuring rapid, cost-effective workforce development through experiential learning. To meet these challenges, we present an adaptive tutoring framework that combines generative AI with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver personalized training. The framework leverages document hit rate and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) to optimize content for each learner, and is benchmarked against human-generated training for alignment and relevance. We demonstrate the framework in 4IR cybersecurity learning by creating a synthetic QA dataset emulating trainee behavior, while RAG is tuned on curated cybersecurity materials. Evaluation compares its generated training with manually curated queries representing realistic student interactions. Responses are produced using large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, assessed for faithfulness and content alignment. GPT-4 achieves the best performance with 87% relevancy and 100% alignment. Results show this dual-mode approach enables the adaptive tutor to act as both a personalized topic recommender and content generator, offering a scalable solution for rapid, tailored learning in 4IR education and workforce development.

<title>LLM-HyPZ: Hardware Vulnerability Discovery using an LLM-Assisted Hybrid Platform for Zero-Shot Knowledge Extraction and Refinement</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of hardware vulnerabilities has created an urgent need for systematic and scalable analysis methods. Unlike software flaws, which are often patchable post-deployment, hardware weaknesses remain embedded across product lifecycles, posing persistent risks to processors, embedded devices, and IoT platforms. Existing efforts such as the MITRE CWE Hardware List (2021) relied on expert-driven Delphi surveys, which lack statistical rigor and introduce subjective bias, while large-scale data-driven foundations for hardware weaknesses have been largely absent. In this work, we propose LLM-HyPZ, an LLM-assisted hybrid framework for zero-shot knowledge extraction and refinement from vulnerability corpora. Our approach integrates zero-shot LLM classification, contextualized embeddings, unsupervised clustering, and prompt-driven summarization to mine hardware-related CVEs at scale. Applying LLM-HyPZ to the 2021-2024 CVE corpus (114,836 entries), we identified 1,742 hardware-related vulnerabilities. We distilled them into five recurring themes, including privilege escalation via firmware and BIOS, memory corruption in mobile and IoT systems, and physical access exploits. Benchmarking across seven LLMs shows that LLaMA 3.3 70B achieves near-perfect classification accuracy (99.5%) on a curated validation set. Beyond methodological contributions, our framework directly supported the MITRE CWE Most Important Hardware Weaknesses (MIHW) 2025 update by narrowing the candidate search space. Specifically, our pipeline surfaced 411 of the 1,026 CVEs used for downstream MIHW analysis, thereby reducing expert workload and accelerating evidence gathering. These results establish LLM-HyPZ as the first data-driven, scalable approach for systematically discovering hardware vulnerabilities, thereby bridging the gap between expert knowledge and real-world vulnerability evidence.

Abstract: Regional weather forecasting is a critical problem for localized climate adaptation, disaster mitigation, and sustainable development. While machine learning has shown impressive progress in global weather forecasting, regional forecasting remains comparatively underexplored. Existing efforts often use different datasets and experimental setups, limiting fair comparison and reproducibility. We introduce IndiaWeatherBench, a comprehensive benchmark for data-driven regional weather forecasting focused on the Indian subcontinent. IndiaWeatherBench provides a curated dataset built from high-resolution regional reanalysis products, along with a suite of deterministic and probabilistic metrics to facilitate consistent training and evaluation. To establish strong baselines, we implement and evaluate a range of models across diverse architectures, including UNets, Transformers, and Graph-based networks, as well as different boundary conditioning strategies and training objectives. While focused on India, IndiaWeatherBench is easily extensible to other geographic regions. We open-source all raw and preprocessed datasets, model implementations, and evaluation pipelines to promote accessibility and future development. We hope IndiaWeatherBench will serve as a foundation for advancing regional weather forecasting research. Code is available at https://github.com/tung-nd/IndiaWeatherBench.

<title>The Name-Free Gap: Policy-Aware Stylistic Control in Music Generation</title>

Abstract: Text-to-music models capture broad attributes such as instrumentation or mood, but fine-grained stylistic control remains an open challenge. Existing stylization methods typically require retraining or specialized conditioning, which complicates reproducibility and limits policy compliance when artist names are restricted. We study whether lightweight, human-readable modifiers sampled from a large language model can provide a policy-robust alternative for stylistic control. Using MusicGen-small, we evaluate two artists: Billie Eilish (vocal pop) and Ludovico Einaudi (instrumental piano). For each artist, we use fifteen reference excerpts and evaluate matched seeds under three conditions: baseline prompts, artist-name prompts, and five descriptor sets. All prompts are generated using a large language model. Evaluation uses both VGGish and CLAP embeddings with distributional and per-clip similarity measures, including a new min-distance attribution metric. Results show that artist names are the strongest control signal across both artists, while name-free descriptors recover much of this effect. This highlights that existing safeguards such as the restriction of artist names in music generation prompts may not fully prevent style imitation. Cross-artist transfers reduce alignment, showing that descriptors encode targeted stylistic cues. We also present a descriptor table across ten contemporary artists to illustrate the breadth of the tokens. Together these findings define the name-free gap, the controllability difference between artist-name prompts and policy-compliant descriptors, shown through a reproducible evaluation protocol for prompt-level controllability.

<title>Fusion to Enhance: Fusion Visual Encoder to Enhance Multimodal Language Model</title>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in bridging visual perception with high-level textual reasoning. However, they face a fundamental contradiction: while excelling at complex semantic understanding, these models often fail at basic visual tasks that require precise detail perception. This deficiency primarily stems from the prevalent architectural reliance on a single vision encoder optimized for high-level semantic alignment, which inherently sacrifices the ability to capture fine-grained visual information. To address this issue, we introduce Fusion to Enhance (FtZ), a novel vision tower framework. FtZ moves beyond the single-encoder design by innovatively composing a semantically powerful anchor encoder with a perception-rich augmenting encoder via a lightweight Multi-Head Cross-Attention mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that on several challenging benchmarks demanding fine-grained visual understanding, such as TextVQA, POPE, MMMU, MME and MM-Vet, our FtZ model significantly outperforms baselines that use only a single encoder or existing feature fusion methods. This work proves that composing heterogeneous expert encoders is an efficient and effective path to overcoming the visual perception bottleneck in current MLLMs, offering a new design paradigm for building next-generation AI systems with stronger perceptual capabilities.

<title>Confident, Calibrated, or Complicit: Probing the Trade-offs between Safety Alignment and Ideological Bias in Language Models in Detecting Hate Speech</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting implicit and explicit hate speech, examining whether models with minimal safety alignment (uncensored) might provide more objective classification capabilities compared to their heavily-aligned (censored) counterparts. While uncensored models theoretically offer a less constrained perspective free from moral guardrails that could bias classification decisions, our results reveal a surprising trade-off: censored models significantly outperform their uncensored counterparts in both accuracy and robustness, achieving 78.7% versus 64.1% strict accuracy. However, this enhanced performance comes with its own limitation -- the safety alignment acts as a strong ideological anchor, making censored models resistant to persona-based influence, while uncensored models prove highly malleable to ideological framing. Furthermore, we identify critical failures across all models in understanding nuanced language such as irony. We also find alarming fairness disparities in performance across different targeted groups and systemic overconfidence that renders self-reported certainty unreliable. These findings challenge the notion of LLMs as objective arbiters and highlight the need for more sophisticated auditing frameworks that account for fairness, calibration, and ideological consistency.

Abstract: Efficiently steering generative models toward pharmacologically relevant regions of chemical space remains a major obstacle in molecular drug discovery under low-data regimes. We present VECTOR+: Valid-property-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Targeted Optimization and Resampling, a framework that couples property-guided representation learning with controllable molecule generation. VECTOR+ applies to both regression and classification tasks and enables interpretable, data-efficient exploration of functional chemical space. We evaluate on two datasets: a curated PD-L1 inhibitor set (296 compounds with experimental $IC_{50}$ values) and a receptor kinase inhibitor set (2,056 molecules by binding mode). Despite limited training data, VECTOR+ generates novel, synthetically tractable candidates. Against PD-L1 (PDB 5J89), 100 of 8,374 generated molecules surpass a docking threshold of $-15.0$ kcal/mol, with the best scoring $-17.6$ kcal/mol compared to the top reference inhibitor ($-15.4$ kcal/mol). The best-performing molecules retain the conserved biphenyl pharmacophore while introducing novel motifs. Molecular dynamics (250 ns) confirm binding stability (ligand RMSD < $2.5$ angstroms). VECTOR+ generalizes to kinase inhibitors, producing compounds with stronger docking scores than established drugs such as brigatinib and sorafenib. Benchmarking against JT-VAE and MolGPT across docking, novelty, uniqueness, and Tanimoto similarity highlights the superior performance of our method. These results position our work as a robust, extensible approach for property-conditioned molecular design in low-data settings, bridging contrastive learning and generative modeling for reproducible, AI-accelerated discovery.

Abstract: In real-world applications, domain data often contains identifiable or sensitive attributes, is subject to strict regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR), and requires explicit data feature engineering for interpretability and transparency. Existing feature engineering primarily focuses on advancing downstream task performance, often risking privacy leakage. We generalize this learning task under such new requirements as Privacy-Preserving Data Reprogramming (PPDR): given a dataset, transforming features to maximize target attribute prediction accuracy while minimizing sensitive attribute prediction accuracy. PPDR poses challenges for existing systems: 1) generating high-utility feature transformations without being overwhelmed by a large search space, and 2) disentangling and eliminating sensitive information from utility-oriented features to reduce privacy inferability. To tackle these challenges, we propose DELTA, a two-phase variational disentangled generative learning framework. Phase I uses policy-guided reinforcement learning to discover feature transformations with downstream task utility, without any regard to privacy inferability. Phase II employs a variational LSTM seq2seq encoder-decoder with a utility-privacy disentangled latent space design and adversarial-causal disentanglement regularization to suppress privacy signals during feature generation. Experiments on eight datasets show DELTA improves predictive performance by ~9.3% and reduces privacy leakage by ~35%, demonstrating robust, privacy-aware data transformation.

Abstract: The pervasiveness of online toxicity, including hate speech and trolling, disrupts digital interactions and online well-being. Previous research has mainly focused on post-hoc moderation, overlooking the real-time emotional dynamics of online conversations and the impact of users' emotions on others. This paper presents a graph-based framework to identify the need for emotion regulation within online conversations. This framework promotes self-reflection to manage emotional responses and encourage responsible behaviour in real time. Additionally, a comment queuing mechanism is proposed to address intentional trolls who exploit emotions to inflame conversations. This mechanism introduces a delay in publishing comments, giving users time to self-regulate before further engaging in the conversation and helping maintain emotional balance. Analysis of social media data from Twitter and Reddit demonstrates that the graph-based framework reduced toxicity by 12%, while the comment queuing mechanism decreased the spread of anger by 15%, with only 4% of comments being temporarily held on average. These findings indicate that combining real-time emotion regulation with delayed moderation can significantly improve well-being in online environments.

Abstract: Traffic classification, a technique for assigning network flows to predefined categories, has been widely deployed in enterprise and carrier networks. With the massive adoption of mobile devices, encryption is increasingly used in mobile applications to address privacy concerns. Consequently, traditional methods such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) fail to distinguish encrypted traffic. To tackle this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular Machine Learning (ML), has emerged as a promising solution for encrypted traffic classification. A crucial prerequisite for any ML-based approach is traffic data cleaning, which removes flows that are not useful for training (e.g., irrelevant protocols, background activity, control-plane messages, and long-lived sessions). Existing cleaning solutions depend on manual inspection of every captured packet, making the process both costly and time-consuming. In this poster, we present an unsupervised framework that automatically cleans encrypted mobile traffic. Evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our framework incurs only a 2%~2.5% reduction in classification accuracy compared with manual cleaning. These results demonstrate that our method offers an efficient and effective preprocessing step for ML-based encrypted traffic classification.

Abstract: The scalability of pool-based active learning is limited by the computational cost of evaluating large unlabeled datasets, a challenge that is particularly acute in virtual screening for drug discovery. While active learning strategies such as Bayesian Active Learning by Disagreement (BALD) prioritize informative samples, it remains computationally intensive when scaled to libraries containing billions samples. In this work, we introduce BALD-GFlowNet, a generative active learning framework that circumvents this issue. Our method leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to directly sample objects in proportion to the BALD reward. By replacing traditional pool-based acquisition with generative sampling, BALD-GFlowNet achieves scalability that is independent of the size of the unlabeled pool. In our virtual screening experiment, we show that BALD-GFlowNet achieves a performance comparable to that of standard BALD baseline while generating more structurally diverse molecules, offering a promising direction for efficient and scalable molecular discovery.

<title>Reward-Weighted Sampling: Enhancing Non-Autoregressive Characteristics in Masked Diffusion LLMs</title>

arXiv:2509.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for large language modeling. Standard decoding methods for MDMs, such as confidence-based sampling, select tokens independently based on individual token confidences at each diffusion step. However, we observe that this independent token selection often results in generation orders resembling sequential autoregressive processes, limiting the advantages of non-autoregressive modeling. To mitigate this pheonomenon, we propose Reward-Weighted Sampling (RWS), a novel decoding strategy that leverages an external reward model to provide a principled global signal during the iterative diffusion process. Specifically, at each diffusion step, RWS evaluates the quality of the entire intermediate sequence and scales token logits accordingly, guiding token selection by integrating global sequence-level coherence. This method selectively increases the confidence of tokens that initially have lower scores, thereby promoting a more non-autoregressive generation order. Furthermore, we provide theoretical justification showing that reward-weighted logit scaling induces beneficial rank reversals in token selection and consistently improves expected reward. Experiments demonstrate that RWS significantly promotes non-autoregressive generation orders, leading to improvements across multiple evaluation metrics. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating global signals in enhancing both the non-autoregressive properties and overall performance of MDMs.

Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) promises compact function approximators with access to vast Hilbert spaces, but its practical progress is slowed by NISQ-era constraints such as limited qubits and noise accumulation. We introduce a multi-chip ensemble framework using multiple small Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) to overcome these constraints. Our approach partitions complex, high-dimensional observations from the Super Mario Bros environment across independent quantum circuits, then classically aggregates their outputs within a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) framework. This modular architecture enables QRL in complex environments previously inaccessible to quantum agents, achieving superior performance and learning stability compared to classical baselines and single-chip quantum models. The multi-chip ensemble demonstrates enhanced scalability by reducing information loss from dimensionality reduction while remaining implementable on near-term quantum hardware, providing a practical pathway for applying QRL to real-world problems.

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for an Exam Readiness Index (ERI): a composite, blueprint-aware score R in [0,100] that summarizes a learner's readiness for a high-stakes exam while remaining interpretable and actionable. The ERI aggregates six signals -- Mastery (M), Coverage (C), Retention (R), Pace (P), Volatility (V), and Endurance (E) -- each derived from a stream of practice and mock-test interactions. We formalize axioms for component maps and the composite, prove monotonicity, Lipschitz stability, and bounded drift under blueprint re-weighting, and show existence and uniqueness of the optimal linear composite under convex design constraints. We further characterize confidence bands via blueprint-weighted concentration and prove compatibility with prerequisite-admissible curricula (knowledge spaces / learning spaces). The paper focuses on theory; empirical study is left to future work.

<title>Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation: A Replay-Free and Resource-Efficient Approach For Continual Graph Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual Graph Learning(CGL)focuses on acquiring new knowledge while retaining previously learned information, essential for real-world graph applications. Current methods grapple with two main issues:1) The Stability-Plasticity Dilemma: Replay-based methods often create an imbalance between the Dilemma, while incurring significant storage costs.2) The Resource-Heavy Pre-training: Leading replay-free methods critically depend on extensively pre-trained backbones, this reliance imposes a substantial resource burden.In this paper, we argue that the key to overcoming these challenges lies not in replaying data or fine-tuning the entire network, but in dynamically modulating the internal computational flow of a frozen backbone. We posit that lightweight, task-specific modules can effectively steer a GNN's reasoning process. Motivated by this insight, we propose Task-Aware Adaptive Modulation(TAAM), a replay-free, resource-efficient approach that charts a new path for navigating the stability-plasticity dilemma. TAAM's core is its Neural Synapse Modulators(NSM), which are trained and then frozen for each task to store expert knowledge. A pivotal prototype-guided strategy governs these modulators: 1) For training, it initializes a new NSM by deep-copying from a similar past modulator to boost knowledge transfer. 2) For inference, it selects the most relevant frozen NSM for each task. These NSMs insert into a frozen GNN backbone to perform fine-grained, node-attentive modulation of its internal flow-different from the static perturbations of prior methods. Extensive experiments show that TAAM comprehensively outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six GCIL benchmark datasets. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Distinguishing correlation from causation is a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence, often representing a critical barrier to building robust and trustworthy systems. While Pearl's $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus provides a rigorous framework for causal inference, a parallel challenge lies in its physical implementation. Here, we apply and experimentally validate a quantum algorithmic framework for performing causal interventions. Our approach maps causal networks onto quantum circuits where probabilistic links are encoded by controlled-rotation gates, and interventions are realized by a structural remodeling of the circuit -- a physical analogue to Pearl's ``graph surgery''. We demonstrate the method's efficacy by resolving Simpson's Paradox in a 3-qubit model, and show its scalability by quantifying confounding bias in a 10-qubit healthcare simulation. Critically, we provide a proof-of-principle experimental validation on an IonQ Aria quantum computer, successfully reproducing the paradox and its resolution in the presence of real-world noise. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum causal inference, offering a new computational tool to address deep-rooted challenges in algorithmic fairness and explainable AI (XAI).

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy of skin lesion classification models, supporting medical diagnoses and promoting equitable healthcare. However, concerns remain about potential biases related to skin color, which can impact diagnostic outcomes. Ensuring fairness is challenging due to difficulties in classifying skin tones, high computational demands, and the complexity of objectively verifying fairness. To address these challenges, we propose a fairness algorithm for skin lesion classification that overcomes the challenges associated with achieving diagnostic fairness across varying skin tones. By calculating the skewness of the feature map in the convolution layer of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) network and the patches and the heads of the Vision Transformer, our method reduces unnecessary channels related to skin tone, focusing instead on the lesion area. This approach lowers computational costs and mitigates bias without relying on conventional statistical methods. It potentially reduces model size while maintaining fairness, making it more practical for real-world applications.

<title>Causal Interpretation of Sparse Autoencoder Features in Vision</title>

Abstract: Understanding what sparse auto-encoder (SAE) features in vision transformers truly represent is usually done by inspecting the patches where a feature's activation is highest. However, self-attention mixes information across the entire image, so an activated patch often co-occurs with-but does not cause-the feature's firing. We propose Causal Feature Explanation (CaFE), which leverages Effective Receptive Field (ERF). We consider each activation of an SAE feature to be a target and apply input-attribution methods to identify the image patches that causally drive that activation. Across CLIP-ViT features, ERF maps frequently diverge from naive activation maps, revealing hidden context dependencies (e.g., a "roaring face" feature that requires the co-occurrence of eyes and nose, rather than merely an open mouth). Patch insertion tests confirm that CaFE more effectively recovers or suppresses feature activations than activation-ranked patches. Our results show that CaFE yields more faithful and semantically precise explanations of vision-SAE features, highlighting the risk of misinterpretation when relying solely on activation location.

Abstract: This paper proposes an low power approximate multiplier architecture for deep neural network (DNN) applications. A 4:2 compressor, introducing only a single combination error, is designed and integrated into an 8x8 unsigned multiplier. This integration significantly reduces the usage of exact compressors while preserving low error rates. The proposed multiplier is employed within a custom convolution layer and evaluated on neural network tasks, including image recognition and denoising. Hardware evaluation demonstrates that the proposed design achieves up to 30.24% energy savings compared to the best among existing multipliers. In image denoising, the custom approximate convolution layer achieves improved Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) compared to other approximate designs. Additionally, when applied to handwritten digit recognition, the model maintains high classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed architecture offers a favorable balance between energy efficiency and computational precision, making it suitable for low-power AI hardware implementations.

<title>LegalChainReasoner: A Legal Chain-guided Framework for Criminal Judicial Opinion Generation</title>

Abstract: A criminal judicial opinion represents the judge's disposition of a case, including the decision rationale and sentencing. Automatically generating such opinions can assist in analyzing sentencing consistency and provide judges with references to similar past cases. However, current research typically approaches this task by dividing it into two isolated subtasks: legal reasoning and sentencing prediction. This separation often leads to inconsistency between the reasoning and predictions, failing to meet real-world judicial requirements. Furthermore, prior studies rely on manually curated knowledge to enhance applicability, yet such methods remain limited in practical deployment. To address these limitations and better align with legal practice, we propose a new LegalAI task: Judicial Opinion Generation, which simultaneously produces both legal reasoning and sentencing decisions. To achieve this, we introduce LegalChainReasoner, a framework that applies structured legal chains to guide the model through comprehensive case assessments. By integrating factual premises, composite legal conditions, and sentencing conclusions, our approach ensures flexible knowledge injection and end-to-end opinion generation. Experiments on two real-world and open-source Chinese legal case datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline models.

<title>ProCause: Generating Counterfactual Outcomes to Evaluate Prescriptive Process Monitoring Methods</title>

Abstract: Prescriptive Process Monitoring (PresPM) is the subfield of Process Mining that focuses on optimizing processes through real-time interventions based on event log data. Evaluating PresPM methods is challenging due to the lack of ground-truth outcomes for all intervention actions in datasets. A generative deep learning approach from the field of Causal Inference (CI), RealCause, has been commonly used to estimate the outcomes for proposed intervention actions to evaluate a new policy. However, RealCause overlooks the temporal dependencies in process data, and relies on a single CI model architecture, TARNet, limiting its effectiveness. To address both shortcomings, we introduce ProCause, a generative approach that supports both sequential (e.g., LSTMs) and non-sequential models while integrating multiple CI architectures (S-Learner, T-Learner, TARNet, and an ensemble). Our research using a simulator with known ground truths reveals that TARNet is not always the best choice; instead, an ensemble of models offers more consistent reliability, and leveraging LSTMs shows potential for improved evaluations when temporal dependencies are present. We further validate ProCause's practical effectiveness through a real-world data analysis, ensuring a more reliable evaluation of PresPM methods.

<title>Multimodal Iterative RAG for Knowledge Visual Question Answering</title>

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding, their performance remains limited on knowledge-intensive visual questions that require external knowledge beyond the image. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for providing models with external knowledge, its conventional single-pass framework often fails to gather sufficient knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we propose MI-RAG, a Multimodal Iterative RAG framework that leverages reasoning to enhance retrieval and update reasoning over newly retrieved knowledge across modalities. At each iteration, MI-RAG leverages an accumulated reasoning record to dynamically formulate a multi-query. These queries then drive a joint search across heterogeneous knowledge bases containing both visually-grounded and textual knowledge. The newly acquired knowledge is synthesized into the reasoning record, progressively refining understanding across iterations. Experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Encyclopedic VQA, InfoSeek, and OK-VQA, show that MI-RAG significantly improves both retrieval recall and answer accuracy, establishing a scalable approach for compositional reasoning in knowledge-intensive VQA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evident for accurate question answering across various domains. However, rigorous evaluation of their performance on complex question-answering (QA) capabilities is essential before deployment in real-world biomedical and healthcare applications. This paper presents our approach to the MedHopQA track of the BioCreative IX shared task, which focuses on multi-hop biomedical question answering involving diseases, genes, and chemicals. We adopt a supervised fine-tuning strategy leveraging LLaMA 3 8B, enhanced with a curated biomedical question-answer dataset compiled from external sources including BioASQ, MedQuAD, and TREC. Three experimental setups are explored: fine-tuning on combined short and long answers, short answers only, and long answers only. While our models demonstrate strong domain understanding, achieving concept-level accuracy scores of up to 0.8, their Exact Match (EM) scores remain significantly lower, particularly in the test phase. We introduce a two-stage inference pipeline for precise short-answer extraction to mitigate verbosity and improve alignment with evaluation metrics. Despite partial improvements, challenges persist in generating strictly formatted outputs. Our findings highlight the gap between semantic understanding and exact answer evaluation in biomedical LLM applications, motivating further research in output control and post-processing strategies.

<title>Adaptive Contrast Adjustment Module: A Clinically-Inspired Plug-and-Play Approach for Enhanced Fetal Plane Classification</title>

Abstract: Fetal ultrasound standard plane classification is essential for reliable prenatal diagnosis but faces inherent challenges, including low tissue contrast, boundary ambiguity, and operator-dependent image quality variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a plug-and-play adaptive contrast adjustment module (ACAM), whose core design is inspired by the clinical practice of doctors adjusting image contrast to obtain clearer and more discriminative structural information. The module employs a shallow texture-sensitive network to predict clinically plausible contrast parameters, transforms input images into multiple contrast-enhanced views through differentiable mapping, and fuses them within downstream classifiers. Validated on a multi-center dataset of 12,400 images across six anatomical categories, the module consistently improves performance across diverse models, with accuracy of lightweight models increasing by 2.02 percent, accuracy of traditional models increasing by 1.29 percent, and accuracy of state-of-the-art models increasing by 1.15 percent. The innovation of the module lies in its content-aware adaptation capability, replacing random preprocessing with physics-informed transformations that align with sonographer workflows while improving robustness to imaging heterogeneity through multi-view fusion. This approach effectively bridges low-level image features with high-level semantics, establishing a new paradigm for medical image analysis under real-world image quality variations.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-music (TTM) generation have enabled controllable and expressive music creation using natural language prompts. However, the emotional fidelity of TTM systems remains largely underexplored compared to human preference or text alignment. In this study, we introduce AImoclips, a benchmark for evaluating how well TTM systems convey intended emotions to human listeners, covering both open-source and commercial models. We selected 12 emotion intents spanning four quadrants of the valence-arousal space, and used six state-of-the-art TTM systems to generate over 1,000 music clips. A total of 111 participants rated the perceived valence and arousal of each clip on a 9-point Likert scale. Our results show that commercial systems tend to produce music perceived as more pleasant than intended, while open-source systems tend to perform the opposite. Emotions are more accurately conveyed under high-arousal conditions across all models. Additionally, all systems exhibit a bias toward emotional neutrality, highlighting a key limitation in affective controllability. This benchmark offers valuable insights into model-specific emotion rendering characteristics and supports future development of emotionally aligned TTM systems.

<title>Sequential Difference Maximization: Generating Adversarial Examples via Multi-Stage Optimization</title>

Abstract: Efficient adversarial attack methods are critical for assessing the robustness of computer vision models. In this paper, we reconstruct the optimization objective for generating adversarial examples as "maximizing the difference between the non-true labels' probability upper bound and the true label's probability," and propose a gradient-based attack method termed Sequential Difference Maximization (SDM). SDM establishes a three-layer optimization framework of "cycle-stage-step." The processes between cycles and between iterative steps are respectively identical, while optimization stages differ in terms of loss functions: in the initial stage, the negative probability of the true label is used as the loss function to compress the solution space; in subsequent stages, we introduce the Directional Probability Difference Ratio (DPDR) loss function to gradually increase the non-true labels' probability upper bound by compressing the irrelevant labels' probabilities. Experiments demonstrate that compared with previous SOTA methods, SDM not only exhibits stronger attack performance but also achieves higher attack cost-effectiveness. Additionally, SDM can be combined with adversarial training methods to enhance their defensive effects. The code is available at https://github.com/X-L-Liu/SDM.

Abstract: Traffic congestion remains a pressing urban challenge, requiring intelligent transportation systems for real-time management. We present a hybrid framework that combines deep learning and reinforcement learning for acoustic vehicle speed classification. A dual-branch BMCNN processes MFCC and wavelet features to capture complementary frequency patterns. An attention-enhanced DQN adaptively selects the minimal number of audio frames and triggers early decisions once confidence thresholds are reached. Evaluations on IDMT-Traffic and our SZUR-Acoustic (Suzhou) datasets show 95.99% and 92.3% accuracy, with up to 1.63x faster average processing via early termination. Compared with A3C, DDDQN, SA2C, PPO, and TD3, the method provides a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off and is suitable for real-time ITS deployment in heterogeneous urban environments.

<title>Look Beyond: Two-Stage Scene View Generation via Panorama and Video Diffusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from a single image is highly ill-posed due to large unobserved regions, especially for views that deviate significantly from the input. While existing methods focus on consistency between the source and generated views, they often fail to maintain coherence and correct view alignment across long-range or looped trajectories. We propose a model that addresses this by decomposing single-view NVS into a 360-degree scene extrapolation followed by novel view interpolation. This design ensures long-term view and scene consistency by conditioning on keyframes extracted and warped from a generated panoramic representation. In the first stage, a panorama diffusion model learns the scene prior from the input perspective image. Perspective keyframes are then sampled and warped from the panorama and used as anchor frames in a pre-trained video diffusion model, which generates novel views through a proposed spatial noise diffusion process. Compared to prior work, our method produces globally consistent novel views -- even in loop closure scenarios -- while enabling flexible camera control. Experiments on diverse scene datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in generating coherent views along user-defined trajectories. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/YiGuYT/LookBeyond.

Abstract: Explaining machine learning (ML) predictions has become crucial as ML models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains such as healthcare. While SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is widely used for model interpretability, it fails to differentiate between causality and correlation, often misattributing feature importance when features are highly correlated. We propose Causal SHAP, a novel framework that integrates causal relationships into feature attribution while preserving many desirable properties of SHAP. By combining the Peter-Clark (PC) algorithm for causal discovery and the Intervention Calculus when the DAG is Absent (IDA) algorithm for causal strength quantification, our approach addresses the weakness of SHAP. Specifically, Causal SHAP reduces attribution scores for features that are merely correlated with the target, as validated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. This study contributes to the field of Explainable AI (XAI) by providing a practical framework for causal-aware model explanations. Our approach is particularly valuable in domains such as healthcare, where understanding true causal relationships is critical for informed decision-making.

Abstract: Students routinely use ChatGPT and the like now to help them with their homework, such as writing an essay. It takes less effort to complete and is easier to do than by hand. It can even produce as good if not better output than the student's own work. However, there is a growing concern that over-reliance on using GenAI in this way will stifle the development of learning writing and critical thinking skills. How might this trend be reversed? What if students were required to make more effort when using GenAI to do their homework? It might be more challenging, but the additional effort involved could result in them learning more and having a greater sense of achievement. This tension can be viewed as a form of effort paradox; where effort is both viewed as something to be avoided but at the same time is valued. Is it possible to let students learn sometimes with less and other times more effort? Students are already adept at the former but what about the latter? Could we design new kinds of AI tools that deliberately require more effort to use to deepen the learning experience? In this paper, I begin to outline what form these might take, for example, asking students to use a combination of GenAI tools with traditional learning approaches (e.g. note-taking while reading). I also discuss how else to design tools to think with that augments human cognition; where students learn more the skills of metacognition and reflection.

Abstract: This paper presents a low-resource speech-command recognizer combining energy-based voice activity detection (VAD), an optimized Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) pipeline, and the LogNNet reservoir-computing classifier. Using four commands from the Speech Commands da-taset downsampled to 8 kHz, we evaluate four MFCC aggregation schemes and find that adaptive binning (64-dimensional feature vector) offers the best accuracy-to-compactness trade-off. The LogNNet classifier with architecture 64:33:9:4 reaches 92.04% accuracy under speaker-independent evaluation, while requiring significantly fewer parameters than conventional deep learn-ing models. Hardware implementation on Arduino Nano 33 IoT (ARM Cor-tex-M0+, 48 MHz, 32 KB RAM) validates the practical feasibility, achieving ~90% real-time recognition accuracy while consuming only 18 KB RAM (55% utilization). The complete pipeline (VAD -> MFCC -> LogNNet) thus enables reliable on-device speech-command recognition under strict memory and compute limits, making it suitable for battery-powered IoT nodes, wire-less sensor networks, and hands-free control interfaces.

<title>Can General-Purpose Omnimodels Compete with Specialists? A Case Study in Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: The emergence of powerful, general-purpose omnimodels capable of processing diverse data modalities has raised a critical question: can these ``jack-of-all-trades'' systems perform on par with highly specialized models in knowledge-intensive domains? This work investigates this question within the high-stakes field of medical image segmentation. We conduct a comparative study analyzing the zero-shot performance of a state-of-the-art omnimodel (Gemini 2.5 Pro, the ``Nano Banana'' model) against domain-specific deep learning models on three distinct tasks: polyp (endoscopy), retinal vessel (fundus), and breast tumor segmentation (ultrasound). Our study focuses on performance at the extremes by curating subsets of the ``easiest'' and ``hardest'' cases based on the specialist models' accuracy. Our findings reveal a nuanced and task-dependent landscape. For polyp and breast tumor segmentation, specialist models excel on easy samples, but the omnimodel demonstrates greater robustness on hard samples where specialists fail catastrophically. Conversely, for the fine-grained task of retinal vessel segmentation, the specialist model maintains superior performance across both easy and hard cases. Intriguingly, qualitative analysis suggests omnimodels may possess higher sensitivity, identifying subtle anatomical features missed by human annotators. Our results indicate that while current omnimodels are not yet a universal replacement for specialists, their unique strengths suggest a potential complementary role with specialist models, particularly in enhancing robustness on challenging edge cases.

Abstract: Recent AI-based scoliosis screening methods primarily rely on large-scale silhouette datasets, often neglecting clinically relevant postural asymmetries-key indicators in traditional screening. In contrast, pose data provide an intuitive skeletal representation, enhancing clinical interpretability across various medical applications. However, pose-based scoliosis screening remains underexplored due to two main challenges: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, annotated pose datasets; and (2) the discrete and noise-sensitive nature of raw pose coordinates, which hinders the modeling of subtle asymmetries. To address these limitations, we introduce Scoliosis1K-Pose, a 2D human pose annotation set that extends the original Scoliosis1K dataset, comprising 447,900 frames of 2D keypoints from 1,050 adolescents. Building on this dataset, we introduce the Dual Representation Framework (DRF), which integrates a continuous skeleton map to preserve spatial structure with a discrete Postural Asymmetry Vector (PAV) that encodes clinically relevant asymmetry descriptors. A novel PAV-Guided Attention (PGA) module further uses the PAV as clinical prior to direct feature extraction from the skeleton map, focusing on clinically meaningful asymmetries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRF achieves state-of-the-art performance. Visualizations further confirm that the model leverages clinical asymmetry cues to guide feature extraction and promote synergy between its dual representations. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://zhouzi180.github.io/Scoliosis1K/.

Abstract: Latency-critical applications tend to show low utilization of functional units due to frequent cache misses and mispredictions during speculative execution in high-performance superscalar processors. However, due to significant impact on single-thread performance, Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) technology is rarely used with heavy threads of latency-critical applications. In this paper, we explore utilization of SMT technology to support fine-grained parallelization of latency-critical applications. Following the advancements in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce Aira, an AI-powered Parallelization Adviser. To implement Aira, we extend AI Coding Agent in Cursor IDE with additional tools connected through Model Context Protocol, enabling end-to-end AI Agent for parallelization. Additional connected tools enable LLM-guided hotspot detection, collection of dynamic dependencies with Dynamic Binary Instrumentation, SMT-aware performance simulation to estimate performance gains. We apply Aira with Relic parallel framework for fine-grained task parallelism on SMT cores to parallelize latency-critical benchmarks representing real-world applications used in industry. We show 17% geomean performance gain from parallelization of latency-critical benchmarks using Aira with Relic framework.

Abstract: Explainable machine learning has attracted much interest in the community where the stakes are high. Counterfactual explanations methods have become an important tool in explaining a black-box model. The recent advances have leveraged the power of generative models such as an autoencoder. In this paper, we propose a novel method using a Gaussian process to construct the auto-encoder architecture for generating counterfactual samples. The resulting model requires fewer learnable parameters and thus is less prone to overfitting. We also introduce a novel density estimator that allows for searching for in-distribution samples. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithm for selecting the optimal regularization rate on density estimator while searching for counterfactuals. We experiment with our method in several large-scale tabular datasets and compare with other auto-encoder-based methods. The results show that our method is capable of generating diversified and in-distribution counterfactual samples.

Abstract: CLIP's success has demonstrated that prompt tuning can achieve robust cross-modal semantic alignment for tasks ranging from open-domain recognition to fine-grained classification. However, redundant or weakly relevant feature components introduce noise and incur unnecessary computational costs. In this work, we propose Spotlighter, a lightweight token-selection framework that simultaneously enhances accuracy and efficiency in prompt tuning. Spotlighter evaluates each visual token's activation from both sample-wise and semantic-wise perspectives and retains only the top-scoring tokens for downstream prediction. A class-specific semantic memory bank of learned prototypes refines this selection, ensuring semantic representativeness and compensating for discarded features. To further prioritize informative signals, we introduce a two-level ranking mechanism that dynamically weights token--prototype interactions. Across 11 few-shot benchmarks, Spotlighter outperforms CLIP by up to 11.19\% in harmonic mean accuracy and achieves up to 0.8K additional FPS, with only 21 extra parameters. These results establish Spotlighter as an effective and scalable baseline for prompt tuning. Code for our method will be available at https://github.com/greatest-gourmet/Spotlighter.

Abstract: The success of the generative model has gained unprecedented attention in the music generation area. Transformer-based architectures have set new benchmarks for model performance. However, their practical adoption is hindered by some critical challenges: the demand for massive computational resources and inference time, due to their large number of parameters. These obstacles make them infeasible to deploy on edge devices, such as smartphones and wearables, with limited computational resources. In this work, we present TinyMusician, a lightweight music generation model distilled from MusicGen (a State-of-the-art music generation model). TinyMusician integrates two innovations: (i) Stage-mixed Bidirectional and Skewed KL-Divergence and (ii) Adaptive Mixed-Precision Quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that TinyMusician retains 93% of the MusicGen-Small performance with 55% less model size. TinyMusician is the first mobile-deployable music generation model that eliminates cloud dependency while maintaining high audio fidelity and efficient resource usage

Abstract: Interpreting graph neural networks (GNNs) is difficult because message passing mixes signals and internal channels rarely align with human concepts. We study superposition, the sharing of directions by multiple features, directly in the latent space of GNNs. Using controlled experiments with unambiguous graph concepts, we extract features as (i) class-conditional centroids at the graph level and (ii) linear-probe directions at the node level, and then analyze their geometry with simple basis-invariant diagnostics. Across GCN/GIN/GAT we find: increasing width produces a phase pattern in overlap; topology imprints overlap onto node-level features that pooling partially remixes into task-aligned graph axes; sharper pooling increases axis alignment and reduces channel sharing; and shallow models can settle into metastable low-rank embeddings. These results connect representational geometry with concrete design choices (width, pooling, and final-layer activations) and suggest practical approaches for more interpretable GNNs.

Abstract: We present MedCOD (Medical Chain-of-Dictionary), a hybrid framework designed to improve English-to-Spanish medical translation by integrating domain-specific structured knowledge into large language models (LLMs). MedCOD integrates domain-specific knowledge from both the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and the LLM-as-Knowledge-Base (LLM-KB) paradigm to enhance structured prompting and fine-tuning. We constructed a parallel corpus of 2,999 English-Spanish MedlinePlus articles and a 100-sentence test set annotated with structured medical contexts. Four open-source LLMs (Phi-4, Qwen2.5-14B, Qwen2.5-7B, and LLaMA-3.1-8B) were evaluated using structured prompts that incorporated multilingual variants, medical synonyms, and UMLS-derived definitions, combined with LoRA-based fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCOD significantly improves translation quality across all models. For example, Phi-4 with MedCOD and fine-tuning achieved BLEU 44.23, chrF++ 28.91, and COMET 0.863, surpassing strong baseline models like GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini. Ablation studies confirm that both MedCOD prompting and model adaptation independently contribute to performance gains, with their combination yielding the highest improvements. These findings highlight the potential of structured knowledge integration to enhance LLMs for medical translation tasks.

<title>SCOUT: Toward Sub-Quadratic Attention via Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of sequence modeling tasks, but their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability to long sequences. Linear models such as Mamba and sliding-window attention (SWA) address this by mixing tokens through recurrent or localized operations with fixed-size memory, achieving efficient inference. However, these methods risk degrading performance on long sequences due to their inability to retain detailed information from distant tokens. We propose SCOUT (Segment Compression for Optimized Utility in Transformers), a hybrid architecture that compresses tokens locally within fixed-size segments and applies attention only over these compressed representations. Each token embedding is first enriched via a linear local mixer, Mamba or SWA, that integrates recent context. Then, instead of attending to all previous tokens, each token sparsely attends to a small number of compressed checkpoint tokens that summarize the input history. This design retains much of the expressivity of full attention while substantially reducing the computational and memory cost. By attending to compressed history rather than all previous tokens, SCOUT incurs slightly higher memory than purely linear models, but its growth rate remains sub-quadratic and far more scalable than that of full Transformers. We analyze SCOUT's computational and memory efficiency and evaluate it empirically on long-context language modeling and reasoning tasks. SCOUT with both Mamba and SWA mixers outperforms strong long-sequence baselines under the same computational budget, matches full-attention Transformers on language modeling and common-sense reasoning tasks at 400M and 1.3B scales. Moreover, our SCOUT achieves higher end-to-end throughput than SOTA models, while delivering comparable results on long sequence benchmarks.

<title>Structure and Destructure: Dual Forces in the Making of Knowledge Engines</title>

Abstract: The making of knowledge engines in natural language processing has been shaped by two seemingly distinct paradigms: one grounded in structure, the other driven by massively available unstructured data. The structured paradigm leverages predefined symbolic interactions, such as knowledge graphs, as priors and designs models to capture them. In contrast, the unstructured paradigm centers on scaling transformer architectures with increasingly vast data and model sizes, as seen in modern large language models. Despite their divergence, this thesis seeks to establish conceptual connections bridging these paradigms. Two complementary forces, structure and destructure, emerge across both paradigms: structure organizes seen symbolic interactions, while destructure, through periodic embedding resets, improves model plasticity and generalization to unseen scenarios. These connections form a new recipe for developing general knowledge engines that can support transparent, controllable, and adaptable intelligent systems.

<title>ART: Adaptive Resampling-based Training for Imbalanced Classification</title>

Abstract: Traditional resampling methods for handling class imbalance typically uses fixed distributions, undersampling the majority or oversampling the minority. These static strategies ignore changes in class-wise learning difficulty, which can limit the overall performance of the model.
  This paper proposes an Adaptive Resampling-based Training (ART) method that periodically updates the distribution of the training data based on the class-wise performance of the model. Specifically, ART uses class-wise macro F1 scores, computed at fixed intervals, to determine the degree of resampling to be performed.
  Unlike instance-level difficulty modeling, which is noisy and outlier-sensitive, ART adapts at the class level. This allows the model to incrementally shift its attention towards underperforming classes in a way that better aligns with the optimization objective.
  Results on diverse benchmarks, including Pima Indians Diabetes and Yeast dataset demonstrate that ART consistently outperforms both resampling-based and algorithm-level methods, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), NearMiss Undersampling, and Cost-sensitive Learning on binary as well as multi-class classification tasks with varying degrees of imbalance.
  In most settings, these improvements are statistically significant. On tabular datasets, gains are significant under paired t-tests and Wilcoxon tests (p < 0.05), while results on text and image tasks remain favorable. Compared to training on the original imbalanced data, ART improves macro F1 by an average of 2.64 percentage points across all tested tabular datasets. Unlike existing methods, whose performance varies by task, ART consistently delivers the strongest macro F1, making it a reliable choice for imbalanced classification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for accessibility guidance, yet many disability groups remain underserved by their advice. To address this gap, we present taxonomy aligned benchmark1 of human validated, general purpose accessibility questions, designed to systematically audit inclusivity across disabilities. Our benchmark evaluates models along three dimensions: Question-Level Coverage (breadth within answers), Disability-Level Coverage (balance across nine disability categories), and Depth (specificity of support). Applying this framework to 17 proprietary and open-weight models reveals persistent inclusivity gaps: Vision, Hearing, and Mobility are frequently addressed, while Speech, Genetic/Developmental, Sensory-Cognitive, and Mental Health remain under served. Depth is similarly concentrated in a few categories but sparse elsewhere. These findings reveal who gets left behind in current LLM accessibility guidance and highlight actionable levers: taxonomy-aware prompting/training and evaluations that jointly audit breadth, balance, and depth.

<title>Clone What You Can't Steal: Black-Box LLM Replication via Logit Leakage and Distillation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical systems, facilitating tasks such as satellite operations, command-and-control, military decision support, and cyber defense. Many of these systems are accessed through application programming interfaces (APIs). When such APIs lack robust access controls, they can expose full or top-k logits, creating a significant and often overlooked attack surface. Prior art has mainly focused on reconstructing the output projection layer or distilling surface-level behaviors. However, regenerating a black-box model under tight query constraints remains underexplored. We address that gap by introducing a constrained replication pipeline that transforms partial logit leakage into a functional deployable substitute model clone. Our two-stage approach (i) reconstructs the output projection matrix by collecting top-k logits from under 10k black-box queries via singular value decomposition (SVD) over the logits, then (ii) distills the remaining architecture into compact student models with varying transformer depths, trained on an open source dataset. A 6-layer student recreates 97.6% of the 6-layer teacher model's hidden-state geometry, with only a 7.31% perplexity increase, and a 7.58 Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL). A 4-layer variant achieves 17.1% faster inference and 18.1% parameter reduction with comparable performance. The entire attack completes in under 24 graphics processing unit (GPU) hours and avoids triggering API rate-limit defenses. These results demonstrate how quickly a cost-limited adversary can clone an LLM, underscoring the urgent need for hardened inference APIs and secure on-premise defense deployments.

Abstract: Multi-task learning is an effective way to address the challenge of model personalization caused by high data heterogeneity in federated learning. However, extending multi-task learning to the online decentralized federated learning setting is yet to be explored. The online decentralized federated learning setting considers many real-world applications of federated learning, such as autonomous systems, where clients communicate peer-to-peer and the data distribution of each client is time-varying. A more serious problem in real-world applications of federated learning is the presence of Byzantine clients. Byzantine-resilient approaches used in federated learning work only when the number of Byzantine clients is less than one-half the total number of clients. Yet, it is difficult to put a limit on the number of Byzantine clients within a system in reality. However, recent work in robotics shows that it is possible to exploit cyber-physical properties of a system to predict clients' behavior and assign a trust probability to received signals. This can help to achieve resiliency in the presence of a dominating number of Byzantine clients. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an online decentralized federated multi-task learning algorithm to provide model personalization and resiliency when the number of Byzantine clients dominates the number of honest clients. Our proposed algorithm leverages cyber-physical properties, such as the received signal strength in wireless systems or side information, to assign a trust probability to local models received from neighbors in each iteration. Our simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs close to a Byzantine-free setting.

Abstract: Considering deep neural networks as manifold mappers, the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm can be interpreted as a two-stage process: pretrain establishes a broad knowledge base, and fine-tune adjusts the model parameters to activate specific neural pathways to align with the target manifold. Although prior fine-tuning approaches demonstrate success, their rigid parameter space limits their ability to dynamically activate appropriate neural pathways, rendering them ill-equipped to adapt flexibly to the diverse and evolving data distributions. In light of this view, we propose a novel approach, Mixture of Expert Prompt Tuning (MEPT), as an effective and efficient manifold-mapping framework. MEPT leverages the Mixture of Experts architecture by integrating multiple prompt experts to adaptively learn diverse and non-stationary data distributions. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MEPT outperforms several state-of-the-art parameter efficient baselines on SuperGLUE, achieving notable improvements in mean accuracy (e.g., 1.94%) while significantly reducing activated prompts by 79.25%. The effectiveness of MEPT is further supported by theoretical insights from manifold learning and validated through neural activation pathway visualization results. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/runtsang/MEPT.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors is crucial for healthcare, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet cross-user variability -- stemming from diverse motion patterns, sensor placements, and physiological traits -- hampers generalization in real-world settings. Conventional supervised learning methods often overfit to user-specific patterns, leading to poor performance on unseen users. Existing domain generalization approaches, while promising, frequently overlook temporal dependencies or depend on impractical domain-specific labels. We propose Temporal-Preserving Reinforcement Learning Domain Generalization (TPRL-DG), a novel framework that redefines feature extraction as a sequential decision-making process driven by reinforcement learning. TPRL-DG leverages a Transformer-based autoregressive generator to produce temporal tokens that capture user-invariant activity dynamics, optimized via a multi-objective reward function balancing class discrimination and cross-user invariance. Key innovations include: (1) an RL-driven approach for domain generalization, (2) autoregressive tokenization to preserve temporal coherence, and (3) a label-free reward design eliminating the need for target user annotations. Evaluations on the DSADS and PAMAP2 datasets show that TPRL-DG surpasses state-of-the-art methods in cross-user generalization, achieving superior accuracy without per-user calibration. By learning robust, user-invariant temporal patterns, TPRL-DG enables scalable HAR systems, facilitating advancements in personalized healthcare, adaptive fitness tracking, and context-aware environments.

Abstract: Images taken through window glass are often degraded by contaminants adhered to the glass surfaces. Such contaminants cause occlusions that attenuate the incoming light and scatter stray light towards the camera. Most of existing deep learning methods for neutralizing the effects of contaminated glasses relied on synthetic training data. Few researchers used real degraded and clean image pairs, but they only considered removing or alleviating the effects of rain drops on glasses. This paper is concerned with the more challenging task of learning the restoration of images taken through glasses contaminated by a wide range of occluders, including muddy water, dirt and other small foreign particles found in reality. To facilitate the learning task we have gone to a great length to acquire real paired images with and without glass contaminants. More importantly, we propose an all-in-one model to neutralize contaminants of different types by utilizing the one-shot test-time adaptation mechanism. It involves a self-supervised auxiliary learning task to update the trained model for the unique occlusion type of each test image. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively in cleaning realistic contaminated images, especially the unseen ones.

Abstract: Cooperation emergence in multi-agent systems represents a fundamental statistical physics problem where microscopic learning rules drive macroscopic collective behavior transitions. We propose a Q-learning-based variant of adaptive rewiring that builds on mechanisms studied in the literature. This method combines temporal difference learning with network restructuring so that agents can optimize strategies and social connections based on interaction histories. Through neighbor-specific Q-learning, agents develop sophisticated partnership management strategies that enable cooperator cluster formation, creating spatial separation between cooperative and defective regions. Using power-law networks that reflect real-world heterogeneous connectivity patterns, we evaluate emergent behaviors under varying rewiring constraint levels, revealing distinct cooperation patterns across parameter space rather than sharp thermodynamic transitions. Our systematic analysis identifies three behavioral regimes: a permissive regime (low constraints) enabling rapid cooperative cluster formation, an intermediate regime with sensitive dependence on dilemma strength, and a patient regime (high constraints) where strategic accumulation gradually optimizes network structure. Simulation results show that while moderate constraints create transition-like zones that suppress cooperation, fully adaptive rewiring enhances cooperation levels through systematic exploration of favorable network configurations. Quantitative analysis reveals that increased rewiring frequency drives large-scale cluster formation with power-law size distributions. Our results establish a new paradigm for understanding intelligence-driven cooperation pattern formation in complex adaptive systems, revealing how machine learning serves as an alternative driving force for spontaneous organization in multi-agent networks.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, necessitating early detection to prevent vision loss. Current automated DR detection systems often struggle with poor-quality images, lack interpretability, and insufficient integration of domain-specific knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework that integrates three innovative contributions: (1) Adaptive Retinal Image Enhancement Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs): this technique dynamically enhances retinal images by incorporating physical constraints, improving the visibility of critical features such as microaneurysms, hemorrhages, and exudates; (2) Hybrid Feature Fusion Network (HFFN): by combining deep learning embeddings with handcrafted features, HFFN leverages both learned representations and domain-specific knowledge to enhance generalization and accuracy; (3) Multi-Stage Classifier with Uncertainty Quantification: this method breaks down the classification process into logical stages, providing interpretable predictions and confidence scores, thereby improving clinical trust. The proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 92.7%, a precision of 92.5%, a recall of 92.6%, an F1-score of 92.5%, an AUC of 97.8%, a mAP of 0.96, and an MCC of 0.85. Ophthalmologists rated the framework's predictions as highly clinically relevant (4.8/5), highlighting its alignment with real-world diagnostic needs. Qualitative analyses, including Grad-CAM visualizations and uncertainty heatmaps, further enhance the interpretability and trustworthiness of the system. The framework demonstrates robust performance across diverse conditions, including low-quality images, noisy data, and unseen datasets. These features make the proposed framework a promising tool for clinical adoption, enabling more accurate and reliable DR detection in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the knowledge and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models in Islamic inheritance law, known as 'ilm al-mawarith. We assess the performance of seven LLMs using a benchmark of 1,000 multiple-choice questions covering diverse inheritance scenarios, designed to test models' ability to understand the inheritance context and compute the distribution of shares prescribed by Islamic jurisprudence. The results reveal a significant performance gap: o3 and Gemini 2.5 achieved accuracies above 90%, whereas ALLaM, Fanar, LLaMA, and Mistral scored below 50%. These disparities reflect important differences in reasoning ability and domain adaptation. We conduct a detailed error analysis to identify recurring failure patterns across models, including misunderstandings of inheritance scenarios, incorrect application of legal rules, and insufficient domain knowledge. Our findings highlight limitations in handling structured legal reasoning and suggest directions for improving performance in Islamic legal reasoning.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model inference, but its reliance on a fixed speculation length is suboptimal in large-batch serving environments with diverse requests. This paper explores a new direction for dynamic adaptation by investigating a novel class of post-hoc, diagnostic signals. We propose Dynamic Speculative Decoding Engine (DSDE), a training-free framework built on two primary components: (1) a predictive signal based on the variance of the Kullback-Leibler (KLD) divergence, which diagnoses the generation's regional stability, and (2) an adaptive speculation length cap to mitigate the straggler problem in per-sequence decoding. Experiments demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across diverse workloads. This robustness is particularly valuable in challenging low-acceptance-rate regimes, where the proposed signal maintains its diagnostic utility. Collectively, these findings validate post-hoc signals as a valuable component for building more robust and intelligent LLM inference systems, and highlight a promising direction for future research on dynamic speculation length adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in leveraging extensive external knowledge to enhance responses in multi-turn and agentic applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However, processing long-context inputs introduces significant system latency and demands substantial memory for the key-value cache, resulting in reduced throughput and a fundamental trade-off between knowledge enrichment and system efficiency. While minimizing latency for long-context inputs is a primary objective for LLMs, we contend that RAG require specialized consideration. In RAG, much of the LLM context consists of concatenated passages from retrieval, with only a small subset directly relevant to the query. These passages often exhibit low semantic similarity due to diversity or deduplication during re-ranking, leading to block-diagonal attention patterns that differ from those in standard LLM generation tasks. Based on this observation, we argue that most computations over the RAG context during decoding are unnecessary and can be eliminated with minimal impact on performance. To this end, we propose REFRAG, an efficient decoding framework that compresses, senses, and expands to improve latency in RAG applications. By exploiting the sparsity structure, we demonstrate a 30.85 the time-to-first-token acceleration (3.75 improvement to previous work) without loss in perplexity. In addition, our optimization framework for large context enables REFRAG to extend the context size of LLMs by 16. We provide rigorous validation of REFRAG across diverse long-context tasks, including RAG, multi-turn conversations, and long document summarization, spanning a wide range of datasets. Experimental results confirm that REFRAG delivers substantial speedup with no loss in accuracy compared to LLaMA models and other state-of-the-art baselines across various context sizes.

Abstract: How does the natural evolution of context paragraphs affect question answering in generative Large Language Models (LLMs)? To investigate this, we propose a framework for curating naturally evolved, human-edited variants of reading passages from contemporary QA benchmarks and for analyzing LLM performance across a range of semantic similarity scores, which quantify how closely each variant aligns with content seen during pretraining. Using this framework, we evaluate six QA datasets and eight LLMs with publicly available training data. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance declines as reading passages naturally diverge from the versions encountered during pretraining-even when the question and all necessary information remains present at inference time. For instance, average model accuracy on BoolQ drops by over 30% from the highest to lowest similarity bins, with slopes exceeding 70 across several LLMs. These findings suggest that natural text evolution poses a significant challenge to the language understanding capabilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Time Series Anomaly Detection metrics serve as crucial tools for model evaluation. However, existing metrics suffer from several limitations: insufficient discriminative power, strong hyperparameter dependency, sensitivity to perturbations, and high computational overhead. This paper introduces Confidence-Consistency Evaluation (CCE), a novel evaluation metric that simultaneously measures prediction confidence and uncertainty consistency. By employing Bayesian estimation to quantify the uncertainty of anomaly scores, we construct both global and event-level confidence and consistency scores for model predictions, resulting in a concise CCE metric. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that CCE possesses strict boundedness, Lipschitz robustness against score perturbations, and linear time complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Furthermore, we establish RankEval, a benchmark for comparing the ranking capabilities of various metrics. RankEval represents the first standardized and reproducible evaluation pipeline that enables objective comparison of evaluation metrics. Both CCE and RankEval implementations are fully open-source.

Abstract: Goal-oriented semantic communication (SC) aims to revolutionize communication systems by transmitting only task-essential information. However, current approaches face challenges such as joint training at transceivers, leading to redundant data exchange and reliance on labeled datasets, which limits their task-agnostic utility. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Goal-oriented Invariant Representation-based SC (SC-GIR) for image transmission. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to extract an invariant representation that encapsulates crucial information from the source data, independent of the specific downstream task. This compressed representation facilitates efficient communication while retaining key features for successful downstream task execution. Focusing on machine-to-machine tasks, we utilize covariance-based contrastive learning techniques to obtain a latent representation that is both meaningful and semantically dense. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on downstream tasks, we apply it to various image datasets for lossy compression. The compressed representations are then used in a goal-oriented AI task. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SC-GIR outperforms baseline schemes by nearly 10%,, and achieves over 85% classification accuracy for compressed data under different SNR conditions. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in learning compact and informative latent representations.

<title>MATL-DC: A Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning Framework for EEG Emotion Recognition with Domain-Class Prototype under Unseen Targets</title>

Abstract: Emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals is increasingly becoming a key research hotspot in affective Brain-Computer Interfaces (aBCIs). However, the current transfer learning model greatly depends on the source domain and target domain data, which hinder the practical application of emotion recognition. Therefore, we propose a Multi-domain Aggregation Transfer Learning framework for EEG emotion recognition with Domain-Class prototype under unseen targets (MATL-DC). We design the feature decoupling module to decouple class-invariant domain features from domain-invariant class features from shallow features. In the model training stage, the multi-domain aggregation mechanism aggregates the domain feature space to form a superdomain, which enhances the characteristics of emotional EEG signals. In each superdomain, we further extract the class prototype representation by class features. In addition, we adopt the pairwise learning strategy to transform the sample classification problem into the similarity problem between sample pairs, which effectively alleviates the influence of label noise. It is worth noting that the target domain is completely unseen during the training process. In the inference stage, we use the trained domain-class prototypes for inference, and then realize emotion recognition. We rigorously validate it on the publicly available databases (SEED, SEED-IV and SEED-V). The results show that the accuracy of MATL-DC model is 84.70\%, 68.11\% and 61.08\%, respectively. MATL-DC achieves comparable or even better performance than methods that rely on both source and target domains. The source code is available at https://github.com/WuCB-BCI/MATL-DC.

Abstract: Auscultation is a key method for early diagnosis of respiratory and pulmonary diseases, relying on skilled healthcare professionals. However, the process is often subjective, with variability between experts. As a result, numerous deep learning-based automatic classification methods have emerged, most of which focus on respiratory sound classification. In contrast, research on respiratory sound event detection remains limited. Existing sound event detection methods typically rely on frame-level predictions followed by post-processing to generate event-level outputs, making interval boundaries challenging to learn directly. Furthermore, many approaches can only handle fixed-length audio, lim- iting their applicability to variable-length respiratory sounds. Additionally, the impact of respiratory sound location information on detection performance has not been extensively explored. To address these issues, we propose a graph neural network-based framework with anchor intervals, capable of handling variable-length audio and providing more precise temporal localization for abnormal respi- ratory sound events. Our method improves both the flexibility and applicability of respiratory sound detection. Experiments on the SPRSound 2024 and HF Lung V1 datasets demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the proposed approach, and incorporating respiratory position information enhances the discrimination between abnormal sounds.

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to infer new knowledge and make predictions from knowledge graphs. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities. LLM-enhanced KGC methods primarily focus on designing task-specific instructions, achieving promising advancements. However, there are still two critical challenges. First, existing methods often ignore the inconsistent representation spaces between natural language and graph structures. Second, most approaches design separate instructions for different KGC tasks, leading to duplicate works and time-consuming processes. To address these challenges, we propose SAT, a novel framework that enhances LLMs for KGC via structure-aware alignment-tuning. Specifically, we first introduce hierarchical knowledge alignment to align graph embeddings with the natural language space through multi-task contrastive learning. Then, we propose structural instruction tuning to guide LLMs in performing structure-aware reasoning over KGs, using a unified graph instruction combined with a lightweight knowledge adapter. Experimental results on two KGC tasks across four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in the link prediction task with improvements ranging from 8.7% to 29.8%.

<title>DynaMind: Reconstructing Dynamic Visual Scenes from EEG by Aligning Temporal Dynamics and Multimodal Semantics to Guided Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01177</link>

Abstract: Reconstruction dynamic visual scenes from electroencephalography (EEG) signals remains a primary challenge in brain decoding, limited by the low spatial resolution of EEG, a temporal mismatch between neural recordings and video dynamics, and the insufficient use of semantic information within brain activity. Therefore, existing methods often inadequately resolve both the dynamic coherence and the complex semantic context of the perceived visual stimuli. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DynaMind, a novel framework that reconstructs video by jointly modeling neural dynamics and semantic features via three core modules: a Regional-aware Semantic Mapper (RSM), a Temporal-aware Dynamic Aligner (TDA), and a Dual-Guidance Video Reconstructor (DGVR). The RSM first utilizes a regional-aware encoder to extract multimodal semantic features from EEG signals across distinct brain regions, aggregating them into a unified diffusion prior. In the mean time, the TDA generates a dynamic latent sequence, or blueprint, to enforce temporal consistency between the feature representations and the original neural recordings. Together, guided by the semantic diffusion prior, the DGVR translates the temporal-aware blueprint into a high-fidelity video reconstruction. On the SEED-DV dataset, DynaMind sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), boosting reconstructed video accuracies (video- and frame-based) by 12.5 and 10.3 percentage points, respectively. It also achieves a leap in pixel-level quality, showing exceptional visual fidelity and temporal coherence with a 9.4% SSIM improvement and a 19.7% FVMD reduction. This marks a critical advancement, bridging the gap between neural dynamics and high-fidelity visual semantics.

Abstract: Multi-subject personalized image generation aims to synthesize customized images containing multiple specified subjects without requiring test-time optimization. However, achieving fine-grained independent control over multiple subjects remains challenging due to difficulties in preserving subject fidelity and preventing cross-subject attribute leakage. We present FocusDPO, a framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic correspondence and supervision image complexity. During training, our method progressively adjusts these focal areas across noise timesteps, implementing a weighted strategy that rewards information-rich patches while penalizing regions with low prediction confidence. The framework dynamically adjusts focus allocation during the DPO process according to the semantic complexity of reference images and establishes robust correspondence mappings between generated and reference subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the performance of existing pre-trained personalized generation models, achieving state-of-the-art results on both single-subject and multi-subject personalized image synthesis benchmarks. Our method effectively mitigates attribute leakage while preserving superior subject fidelity across diverse generation scenarios, advancing the frontier of controllable multi-subject image synthesis.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to process and reason over long textual inputs is critical for a wide range of real-world applications. However, progress in this area is significantly constrained by the absence of high-quality, diverse, and verifiable long-context datasets suitable for both training and evaluation. This work introduces a modular, extensible framework for synthetic long-context data generation via prompt-based interaction with LLMs. The framework supports multiple training and alignment objectives, including Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). It encompasses four core generation paradigms: multi-turn conversational dialogues, document-grounded input-output pairs, verifiable instruction-response tasks, and long-context reasoning examples. Through templated prompting, a model-agnostic architecture, and metadata-enriched outputs, the proposed approach facilitates scalable, controllable, and purpose-aligned dataset creation for advancing long-context capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly governed by natural language principles, yet a key challenge arising from reliance on language remains underexplored: interpretive ambiguity. As in legal systems, ambiguity arises both from how these principles are written and how they are applied. But while legal systems use institutional safeguards to manage such ambiguity, such as transparent appellate review policing interpretive constraints, AI alignment pipelines offer no comparable protections. Different interpretations of the same rule can lead to inconsistent or unstable model behavior. Drawing on legal theory, we identify key gaps in current alignment pipelines by examining how legal systems constrain ambiguity at both the rule creation and rule application steps. We then propose a computational framework that mirrors two legal mechanisms: (1) a rule refinement pipeline that minimizes interpretive disagreement by revising ambiguous rules (analogous to agency rulemaking or iterative legislative action), and (2) prompt-based interpretive constraints that reduce inconsistency in rule application (analogous to legal canons that guide judicial discretion). We evaluate our framework on a 5,000-scenario subset of the WildChat dataset and show that both interventions significantly improve judgment consistency across a panel of reasonable interpreters. Our approach offers a first step toward systematically managing interpretive ambiguity, an essential step for building more robust, law-following AI systems.

<title>Preserving Vector Space Properties in Dimensionality Reduction: A Relationship Preserving Loss Framework</title>

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction can distort vector space properties such as orthogonality and linear independence, which are critical for tasks including cross-modal retrieval, clustering, and classification. We propose a Relationship Preserving Loss (RPL), a loss function that preserves these properties by minimizing discrepancies between relationship matrices (e.g., Gram or cosine) of high-dimensional data and their low-dimensional embeddings. RPL trains neural networks for non-linear projections and is supported by error bounds derived from matrix perturbation theory. Initial experiments suggest that RPL reduces embedding dimensions while largely retaining performance on downstream tasks, likely due to its preservation of key vector space properties. While we describe here the use of RPL in dimensionality reduction, this loss can also be applied more broadly, for example to cross-domain alignment and transfer learning, knowledge distillation, fairness and invariance, dehubbing, graph and manifold learning, and federated learning, where distributed embeddings must remain geometrically consistent.

Abstract: Self-supervised monocular depth estimation is a significant task for low-cost and efficient three-dimensional scene perception in endoscopy. The variety of illumination conditions and scene features is still the primary challenge for generalizable depth estimation in endoscopic scenes. In this work, a self-supervised framework is proposed for monocular depth estimation in various endoscopy. Firstly, due to various features in endoscopic scenes with different tissues, a novel block-wise mixture of dynamic low-rank experts is proposed to efficiently finetuning the foundation model for endoscopic depth estimation. In the proposed module, based on the input feature, different experts with a small amount of trainable parameters are adaptively selected for weighted inference, from various mixture of low-rank experts which are allocated based on the training quality of each block. Moreover, a novel self-supervised training framework is proposed to jointly cope with the inconsistency of brightness and reflectance. The proposed method outperform state-of-the-art works on both realistic and simulated endoscopic datasets. Furthermore, the proposed network also achieves the best generalization based on zero-shot depth estimation on diverse endoscopic scenes. The proposed method could contribute to accurate endoscopic perception for minimally invasive measurement and surgery. The code will be released upon acceptance, while the demo video can be found on here: https://endo-gede.netlify.app/.

Abstract: With the proliferation of applications built upon LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MAS), the security of Web links has become a critical concern in ensuring system reliability. Once an agent is induced to visit a malicious website, attackers can use it as a springboard to conduct diverse subsequent attacks, which will drastically expand the attack surface. In this paper, we propose Web Fraud Attacks, a novel type of attack aiming at inducing MAS to visit malicious websites. We design 11 representative attack variants that encompass domain name tampering (homoglyph deception, character substitution, etc.), link structure camouflage (sub-directory nesting, sub-domain grafting, parameter obfuscation, etc.), and other deceptive techniques tailored to exploit MAS's vulnerabilities in link validation. Through extensive experiments on these crafted attack vectors, we demonstrate that Web fraud attacks not only exhibit significant destructive potential across different MAS architectures but also possess a distinct advantage in evasion: they circumvent the need for complex input formats such as jailbreaking, which inherently carry higher exposure risks. These results underscore the importance of addressing Web fraud attacks in LLM-driven MAS, as their stealthiness and destructiveness pose non-negligible threats to system security and user safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with domain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many open-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream tasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal LLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses this challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering methodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three distinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods, and (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the density of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we use an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model Level: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and remove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging paradigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible. Extensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&amp;A, financial Q&amp;A, general Q&amp;A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while saving approximately 20-fold in training time.

Abstract: Quantization is a critical technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing memory footprint and improving computational efficiency. Among various schemes, 4-bit weight and 8-bit activation quantization (W4A8) offers a strong balance between accuracy and performance. However, existing W4A8 GEMM kernels fall short in practice due to inefficient dequantization on CUDA Cores, which cannot keep pace with the high throughput of Tensor Cores. In this paper, we present LiquidGEMM, a hardware-efficient W4A8 GEMM kernel for efficient LLM serving. LiquidGEMM designs two key techniques: LiquidQuant, a hardware-efficient quantization method that enables fast, overflow-safe dequantization using just two arithmetic instructions per four elements; and an implicit fine-grained pipeline that fully overlaps weight loading, dequantization, and MMA across warp groups without software synchronization or redundant memory traffic. Experimental results show that LiquidGEMM achieves up to 2.90x speedup over state-of-the-art W4A8 kernels and up to 4.94x end-to-end system-level speedup. Compared to various quantized GEMM kernels in NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM, LiquidGEMM delivers 1.12-1.63x performance gains, and achieves up to 1.63x system-level speedup.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought reasoning has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing model inference capabilities. Despite growing interest in Chain-of-Thought reasoning, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This paper explores the working mechanisms of Chain-of-Thought reasoning from the perspective of the dual relationship between in-context learning and pretrained priors. We first conduct a fine-grained lexical-level analysis of rationales to examine the model's reasoning behavior. Then, by incrementally introducing noisy exemplars, we examine how the model balances pretrained priors against erroneous in-context information. Finally, we investigate whether prompt engineering can induce slow thinking in large language models. Our extensive experiments reveal three key findings: (1) The model not only quickly learns the reasoning structure at the lexical level but also grasps deeper logical reasoning patterns, yet it heavily relies on pretrained priors. (2) Providing sufficient exemplars shifts the model's decision-making from pretrained priors to in-context signals, while misleading prompts introduce instability. (3) Long Chain-of-Thought prompting can induce the model to generate longer reasoning chains, thereby improving its performance on downstream tasks.

Abstract: Object detection architectures are notoriously difficult to understand, often more so than large language models. While RT-DETRv2 represents an important advance in real-time detection, most existing diagrams do little to clarify how its components actually work and fit together. In this article, we explain the architecture of RT-DETRv2 through a series of eight carefully designed illustrations, moving from the overall pipeline down to critical components such as the encoder, decoder, and multi-scale deformable attention. Our goal is to make the existing one genuinely understandable. By visualizing the flow of tensors and unpacking the logic behind each module, we hope to provide researchers and practitioners with a clearer mental model of how RT-DETRv2 works under the hood.

Abstract: In edge computing systems, autonomous agents must make fast local decisions while competing for shared resources. Existing MARL methods often resume to centralized critics or frequent communication, which fail under limited observability and communication constraints. We propose a decentralized framework in which each agent solves a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), coordinating implicitly through a shared constraint vector. For the specific case of offloading, e.g., constraints prevent overloading shared server resources. Coordination constraints are updated infrequently and act as a lightweight coordination mechanism. They enable agents to align with global resource usage objectives but require little direct communication. Using safe reinforcement learning, agents learn policies that meet both local and global goals. We establish theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions and validate our approach experimentally, showing improved performance over centralized and independent baselines, especially in large-scale settings.

Abstract: Sample efficiency in the face of computationally expensive simulations is a common concern in surrogate modeling. Current strategies to minimize the number of samples needed are not as effective in simulated environments with wide state spaces. As a response to this challenge, we propose a novel method to efficiently sample simulated deterministic environments by using policies trained by Reinforcement Learning. We provide an extensive analysis of these surrogate-building strategies with respect to Latin-Hypercube sampling or Active Learning and Kriging, cross-validating performances with all sampled datasets. The analysis shows that a mixed dataset that includes samples acquired by random agents, expert agents, and agents trained to explore the regions of maximum entropy of the state transition distribution provides the best scores through all datasets, which is crucial for a meaningful state space representation. We conclude that the proposed method improves the state-of-the-art and clears the path to enable the application of surrogate-aided Reinforcement Learning policy optimization strategies on complex simulators.

Abstract: In a context where the social sciences and humanities are experimenting with non-anthropocentric analytical frames, this article proposes a semiotic (structural) reading of the hybridization between symbolic AI and neural (or sub-symbolic) AI based on a field of application: the design and use of a knowledge base for area studies. We describe the LaCAS ecosystem -- Open Archives in Linguistic and Cultural Studies (thesaurus; RDF/OWL ontology; LOD services; harvesting; expertise; publication), deployed at Inalco (National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations) in Paris with the Okapi (Open Knowledge and Annotation Interface) software environment from Ina (National Audiovisual Institute), which now has around 160,000 documentary resources and ten knowledge macro-domains grouping together several thousand knowledge objects. We illustrate this approach using the knowledge domain ''Languages of the world'' (~540 languages) and the knowledge object ''Quechua (language)''. On this basis, we discuss the controlled integration of neural tools, more specifically generative tools, into the life cycle of a knowledge base: assistance with data localization/qualification, index extraction and aggregation, property suggestion and testing, dynamic file generation, and engineering of contextualized prompts (generic, contextual, explanatory, adjustment, procedural) aligned with a domain ontology. We outline an ecosystem of specialized agents capable of animating the database while respecting its symbolic constraints, by articulating model-driven and data-driven methods.

<title>Towards Trustworthy Vital Sign Forecasting: Leveraging Uncertainty for Prediction Intervals</title>

Abstract: Vital signs, such as heart rate and blood pressure, are critical indicators of patient health and are widely used in clinical monitoring and decision-making. While deep learning models have shown promise in forecasting these signals, their deployment in healthcare remains limited in part because clinicians must be able to trust and interpret model outputs. Without reliable uncertainty quantification -- particularly calibrated prediction intervals (PIs) -- it is unclear whether a forecasted abnormality constitutes a meaningful warning or merely reflects model noise, hindering clinical decision-making. To address this, we present two methods for deriving PIs from the Reconstruction Uncertainty Estimate (RUE), an uncertainty measure well-suited to vital-sign forecasting due to its sensitivity to data shifts and support for label-free calibration. Our parametric approach assumes that prediction errors and uncertainty estimates follow a Gaussian copula distribution, enabling closed-form PI computation. Our non-parametric approach, based on k-nearest neighbours (KNN), empirically estimates the conditional error distribution using similar validation instances. We evaluate these methods on two large public datasets with minute- and hour-level sampling, representing high- and low-frequency health signals. Experiments demonstrate that the Gaussian copula method consistently outperforms conformal prediction baselines on low-frequency data, while the KNN approach performs best on high-frequency data. These results underscore the clinical promise of RUE-derived PIs for delivering interpretable, uncertainty-aware vital sign forecasts.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash, a 560-billion-parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model designed for both computational efficiency and advanced agentic capabilities. Stemming from the need for scalable efficiency, LongCat-Flash adopts two novel designs: (a) Zero-computation Experts, which enables dynamic computational budget allocation and activates 18.6B-31.3B (27B on average) per token depending on contextual demands, optimizing resource usage. (b) Shortcut-connected MoE, which enlarges the computation-communication overlap window, demonstrating notable gains in inference efficiency and throughput compared to models of a comparable scale. We develop a comprehensive scaling framework for large models that combines hyperparameter transfer, model-growth initialization, a multi-pronged stability suite, and deterministic computation to achieve stable and reproducible training. Notably, leveraging the synergy among scalable architectural design and infrastructure efforts, we complete model training on more than 20 trillion tokens within 30 days, while achieving over 100 tokens per second (TPS) for inference at a cost of \$0.70 per million output tokens. To cultivate LongCat-Flash towards agentic intelligence, we conduct a large-scale pre-training on optimized mixtures, followed by targeted mid- and post-training on reasoning, code, and instructions, with further augmentation from synthetic data and tool use tasks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, as a non-thinking foundation model, LongCat-Flash delivers highly competitive performance among other leading models, with exceptional strengths in agentic tasks. The model checkpoint of LongCat-Flash is open-sourced to foster community research.

Abstract: Industrial-scale battery management involves various types of tasks, such as estimation, prediction, and system-level diagnostics. Each task employs distinct data across temporal scales, sensor resolutions, and data channels. Building task-specific methods requires a great deal of data and engineering effort, which limits the scalability of intelligent battery management. Here we present the Flexible Masked Autoencoder (FMAE), a flexible pretraining framework that can learn with missing battery data channels and capture inter-correlations across data snippets. FMAE learns unified battery representations from heterogeneous data and can be adopted by different tasks with minimal data and engineering efforts. Experimentally, FMAE consistently outperforms all task-specific methods across five battery management tasks with eleven battery datasets. On remaining life prediction tasks, FMAE uses 50 times less inference data while maintaining state-of-the-art results. Moreover, when real-world data lack certain information, such as system voltage, FMAE can still be applied with marginal performance impact, achieving comparable results with the best hand-crafted features. FMAE demonstrates a practical route to a flexible, data-efficient model that simplifies real-world multi-task management of dynamical systems.

<title>LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning for Multimodal Intent Recognition</title>

Abstract: Understanding human intents from multimodal signals is critical for analyzing human behaviors and enhancing human-machine interactions in real-world scenarios. However, existing methods exhibit limitations in their modality-level reliance, constraining relational reasoning over fine-grained semantics for complex intent understanding. This paper proposes a novel LLM-Guided Semantic Relational Reasoning (LGSRR) method, which harnesses the expansive knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to establish semantic foundations that boost smaller models' relational reasoning performance. Specifically, an LLM-based strategy is proposed to extract fine-grained semantics as guidance for subsequent reasoning, driven by a shallow-to-deep Chain-of-Thought (CoT) that autonomously uncovers, describes, and ranks semantic cues by their importance without relying on manually defined priors. Besides, we formally model three fundamental types of semantic relations grounded in logical principles and analyze their nuanced interplay to enable more effective relational reasoning. Extensive experiments on multimodal intent and dialogue act recognition tasks demonstrate LGSRR's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, with consistent performance gains across diverse semantic understanding scenarios. The complete data and code are available at https://github.com/thuiar/LGSRR.

<title>Street-Level Geolocalization Using Multimodal Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Street-level geolocalization from images is crucial for a wide range of essential applications and services, such as navigation, location-based recommendations, and urban planning. With the growing popularity of social media data and cameras embedded in smartphones, applying traditional computer vision techniques to localize images has become increasingly challenging, yet highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates open-weight and publicly accessible multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation. The method constructs a vector database using the SigLIP encoder on two large-scale datasets (EMP-16 and OSV-5M). Query images are augmented with prompts containing both similar and dissimilar geolocation information retrieved from this database before being processed by the multimodal large language models. Our approach has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving higher accuracy compared against three widely used benchmark datasets (IM2GPS, IM2GPS3k, and YFCC4k). Importantly, our solution eliminates the need for expensive fine-tuning or retraining and scales seamlessly to incorporate new data sources. The effectiveness of retrieval-augmented generation-based multimodal large language models in geolocation estimation demonstrated by this paper suggests an alternative path to the traditional methods which rely on the training models from scratch, opening new possibilities for more accessible and scalable solutions in GeoAI.

<title>AT Loss: Advanced Torrential Loss Function for Precipitation Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is becoming increasingly important in the context of climate change. In response, machine learning-based approaches have recently gained attention as an emerging alternative to traditional methods such as numerical weather prediction and climate models. Nonetheless, many recent approaches still rely on off-the-shelf loss functions, and even the more advanced ones merely involve optimization processes based on the critical success index (CSI). The problem, however, is that CSI may become ineffective during extended dry periods when precipitation remains below the threshold, rendering it less than ideal as a criterion for optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce a simple penalty expression and reinterpret it as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation. Ultimately, the resulting QUBO formulation is relaxed into a differentiable advanced torrential (AT) loss function through an approximation process. The proposed AT loss demonstrates its superiority through the Lipschitz constant, forecast performance evaluations, consistency experiments, and ablation studies with the operational model.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel generative method to identify the causal impact and apply it to prediction tasks. We conduct causal impact analysis using interventional and counterfactual perspectives. First, applying interventions, we identify features that have a causal influence on the predicted outcome, which we refer to as causally sensitive features, and second, applying counterfactuals, we evaluate how changes in the cause affect the effect. Our method exploits the Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to identify the causal impact and serve as a generative predictor. We are able to reduce confounding bias by identifying causally sensitive features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by recommending the most likely locations a user will visit next in their spatiotemporal trajectory influenced by the causal relationships among various features. Experiments on the large-scale GeoLife [Zheng et al., 2010] dataset and the benchmark Asia Bayesian network validate the ability of our method to identify causal impact and improve predictive performance.

<title>DPF-CM: A Data Processing Framework with Privacy-Preserving Vector Databases for Chinese Medical LLMs Training and Deployment</title>

Abstract: Current open-source training pipelines for Chinese medical language models predominantly emphasize optimizing training methodologies to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs), yet lack comprehensive exploration into training data processing. To address this gap, we propose DPF-CM, a holistic Data Processing Framework for Chinese Medical LLMs training and deployment. DPF-CM comprises two core modules. The first module is a data processing pipeline tailored for model training. Beyond standard data processing operations, we (1) introduce a chained examples context-learning strategy to generate question-oriented instructions to mitigate the lack of instruction content, and (2) implement an ensemble-based filtering mechanism for preference data curation that averages multiple reward models to suppress noisy samples. The second module focuses on privacy preservation during model deployment. To prevent privacy risks from the inadvertent exposure of training data, we propose a Privacy Preserving Vector Database (PPVD) approach, which involves model memory search, high-risk database construction, secure database construction, and match-and-replace, four key stages to minimize privacy leakage during inference collectively. Experimental results show that DPF-CM significantly improves model accuracy, enabling our trained Chinese medical LLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source counterparts. Moreover, the framework reduces training data privacy leakage by 27%.

Abstract: Real-time video analytics on high-resolution cameras has become a popular technology for various intelligent services like traffic control and crowd monitoring. While extensive work has been done on improving analytics accuracy with timing guarantees, virtually all of them target static viewpoint cameras. In this paper, we present Uirapuru, a novel framework for real-time, edge-based video analytics on high-resolution steerable cameras. The actuation performed by those cameras brings significant dynamism to the scene, presenting a critical challenge to existing popular approaches such as frame tiling. To address this problem, Uirapuru incorporates a comprehensive understanding of camera actuation into the system design paired with fast adaptive tiling at a per-frame level. We evaluate Uirapuru on a high-resolution video dataset, augmented by pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) movements typical for steerable cameras and on real-world videos collected from an actual PTZ camera. Our experimental results show that Uirapuru provides up to 1.45x improvement in accuracy while respecting specified latency budgets or reaches up to 4.53x inference speedup with on-par accuracy compared to state-of-the-art static camera approaches.

Abstract: Nowadays, the volume of network traffic continues to grow, along with the frequency and sophistication of attacks. This scenario highlights the need for solutions capable of continuously adapting, since network behavior is dynamic and changes over time. This work presents an anomaly detection model for network flows using unsupervised machine learning with online learning capabilities. This approach allows the system to dynamically learn the normal behavior of the network and detect deviations without requiring labeled data, which is particularly useful in real-world environments where traffic is constantly changing and labeled data is scarce. The model was implemented using the River library with a One-Class SVM and evaluated on the NF-UNSW-NB15 dataset and its extended version v2, which contain network flows labeled with different attack categories. The results show an accuracy above 98%, a false positive rate below 3.1%, and a recall of 100% in the most advanced version of the dataset. In addition, the low processing time per flow (<0.033 ms) demonstrates the feasibility of the approach for real-time applications.

Abstract: Magnetic levitation is poised to revolutionize industrial automation by integrating flexible in-machine product transport and seamless manipulation. It is expected to become the standard drive for automated manufacturing. However, controlling such systems is inherently challenging due to their complex, unstable dynamics. Traditional control approaches, which rely on hand-crafted control engineering, typically yield robust but conservative solutions, with their performance closely tied to the expertise of the engineering team. In contrast, neural control learning presents a promising alternative. This paper presents the first neural controller for 6D magnetic levitation. Trained end-to-end on interaction data from a proprietary controller, it directly maps raw sensor data and 6D reference poses to coil current commands. The neural controller can effectively generalize to previously unseen situations while maintaining accurate and robust control. These results underscore the practical feasibility of learning-based neural control in complex physical systems and suggest a future where such a paradigm could enhance or even substitute traditional engineering approaches in demanding real-world applications. The trained neural controller, source code, and demonstration videos are publicly available at https://sites.google.com/view/neural-maglev.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance on math word problems, yet they have been shown to struggle with meta-reasoning tasks such as identifying errors in student solutions. In this work, we investigate the challenge of locating the first error step in stepwise solutions using two error reasoning datasets: VtG and PRM800K. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to locate the first error step in student solutions even when given access to the reference solution. To that end, we propose an approach that generates an intermediate corrected student solution, aligning more closely with the original student's solution, which helps improve performance.

Abstract: Separating overlapping speech from multiple speakers is crucial for effective human-vehicle interaction. This paper proposes CabinSep, a lightweight neural mask-based minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) speech separation approach, to reduce speech recognition errors in back-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. Our contributions are threefold: First, we utilize channel information to extract spatial features, which improves the estimation of speech and noise masks. Second, we employ MVDR during inference, reducing speech distortion to make it more ASR-friendly. Third, we introduce a data augmentation method combining simulated and real-recorded impulse responses (IRs), improving speaker localization at zone boundaries and further reducing speech recognition errors. With a computational complexity of only 0.4 GMACs, CabinSep achieves a 17.5% relative reduction in speech recognition error rate in a real-recorded dataset compared to the state-of-the-art DualSep model.

Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8\% and silhouette coefficient by 29\%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. Codes and models will be released soon.

Abstract: Community detection in graphs is crucial for understanding the organization of nodes into densely connected clusters. While numerous strategies have been developed to identify these clusters, the success of community detection can lead to privacy and information security concerns, as individuals may not want their personal information exposed. To address this, community deception methods have been proposed to reduce the effectiveness of detection algorithms. Nevertheless, several limitations, such as the rationality of evaluation metrics and the unnoticeability of attacks, have been ignored in current deception methods. Therefore, in this work, we first investigate the limitations of the widely used deception metric, i.e., the decrease of modularity, through empirical studies. Then, we propose a new deception metric, and combine this new metric together with the attack budget to model the unnoticeable community deception task as a multi-objective optimization problem. To further improve the deception performance, we propose two variant methods by incorporating the degree-biased and community-biased candidate node selection mechanisms. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed community deception strategies.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to extract key shots from longer videos to produce concise and informative summaries. One of its most common applications is in sports, where highlight reels capture the most important moments of a game, along with notable reactions and specific contextual events. Automatic summary generation can support video editors in the sports media industry by reducing the time and effort required to identify key segments. However, the lack of publicly available datasets poses a challenge in developing robust models for sports highlight generation. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a curated dataset for soccer video summarization, designed to serve as a benchmark for the task. The dataset includes shot boundaries for 237 matches from the Spanish, French, and Italian leagues, using broadcast footage sourced from the SoccerNet dataset. Alongside the dataset, we propose a baseline model specifically designed for this task, which achieves an F1 score of 0.3956 in the test set. Furthermore, we propose a new metric constrained by the length of each target summary, enabling a more objective evaluation of the generated content. The dataset and code are available at https://ipcv.github.io/SoccerHigh/.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Models (LLMs) occasionally generate plausible yet factually incorrect responses, known as hallucinations. Researchers are primarily using two approaches to mitigate hallucinations, namely Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) and refusal post-training. However, current research predominantly emphasizes their individual effectiveness while overlooking the evaluation of the refusal capability of RALMs. In this study, we ask the fundamental question: Do RALMs know when they don't know? Specifically, we ask three questions. First, are RALMs well-calibrated regarding different internal and external knowledge states? We examine the influence of various factors. Contrary to expectations, we find that LLMs exhibit significant \textbf{over-refusal} behavior. Then, how does refusal post-training affect the over-refusal issue? We investigate the Refusal-aware Instruction Tuning and In-Context Fine-tuning methods. Our results show that the over-refusal problem is mitigated by In-context fine-tuning. but magnified by R-tuning. However, we also find that the refusal ability may conflict with the quality of the answer. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective refusal method for refusal post-trained models to improve their overall answer quality in terms of refusal and correct answers. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the influence of important factors on RALM systems.

Abstract: Explainable systems expose information about why certain observed effects are happening to the agents interacting with them. We argue that this constitutes a positive flow of information that needs to be specified, verified, and balanced against negative information flow that may, e.g., violate privacy guarantees. Since both explainability and privacy require reasoning about knowledge, we tackle these tasks with epistemic temporal logic extended with quantification over counterfactual causes. This allows us to specify that a multi-agent system exposes enough information such that agents acquire knowledge on why some effect occurred. We show how this principle can be used to specify explainability as a system-level requirement and provide an algorithm for checking finite-state models against such specifications. We present a prototype implementation of the algorithm and evaluate it on several benchmarks, illustrating how our approach distinguishes between explainable and unexplainable systems, and how it allows to pose additional privacy requirements.

Abstract: The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module, to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps. Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder, utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets, respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical image segmentation tasks across various datasets.

Abstract: In clinical practice, automatic analysis of electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely applied to identify irregular heart rhythms and other electrical anomalies of the heart, enabling timely intervention and potentially improving clinical outcomes. However, due to the limited samples in certain types of ECG signals, the class imbalance issues pose a challenge for ECG-based detection. In addition, as the volume of patient data grows, long-term storage of all historical data becomes increasingly burdensome as training samples to recognize new patterns and classify existing ECG signals accurately. Therefore, to enhance the performance of anomaly detection while addressing storage limitations, we propose a pseudo-replay based semi-supervised continual learning framework, which consists of two components: unsupervised identification and replay-based detection. For unsupervised identification, an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN)-based framework is integrated to detect novel patterns. Besides, instead of directly storing all historical data, a pseudo replay-based learning strategy is proposed which utilizes a generator to learn the data distribution for each individual task. When a new task arises, the generator synthesizes pseudo data representative of previous learnt classes, enabling the model to detect both the existed patterns and the newly presented anomalies. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated in four public ECG datasets, which leverages supervised classification problems for anomaly detection. The experimental results show that the developed approach is very promising in identifying novel anomalies while maintaining good performance on detecting existing ECG signals.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically face constraints because of their inherent mechanism: a simple top-k semantic search [1]. The approach often leads to the incorporation of irrelevant or redundant information in the context, degrading performance and efficiency [10][11]. This paper presents MeVe, a novel modular architecture intended for Memory Verification and smart context composition. MeVe rethinks the RAG paradigm by proposing a five-phase modular design that distinctly breaks down the retrieval and context composition process into distinct, auditable, and independently tunable phases: initial retrieval, relevance verification, fallback retrieval, context prioritization, and token budgeting. This architecture enables fine-grained control of what knowledge is made available to an LLM, enabling task-dependent filtering and adaptation. We release a reference implementation of MeVe as a proof of concept and evaluate its performance on knowledge-heavy QA tasks over a subset of English Wikipedia [22]. Our results demonstrate that by actively verifying information before composition, MeVe significantly improves context efficiency, achieving a 57% reduction on the Wikipedia dataset and a 75% reduction on the more complex HotpotQA dataset compared to standard RAG implementations [25]. This work provides a framework for more scalable and reliable LLM applications. By refining and distilling contextual information, MeVe offers a path toward better grounding and more accurate factual support [16].

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents, agentic workflows are showing transformative potential in education. This study introduces the Agentic Workflow for Education (AWE), a four-component model comprising self-reflection, tool invocation, task planning, and multi-agent collaboration. We distinguish AWE from traditional LLM-based linear interactions and propose a theoretical framework grounded in the von Neumann Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture. Through a paradigm shift from static prompt-response systems to dynamic, nonlinear workflows, AWE enables scalable, personalized, and collaborative task execution. We further identify four core application domains: integrated learning environments, personalized AI-assisted learning, simulation-based experimentation, and data-driven decision-making. A case study on automated math test generation shows that AWE-generated items are statistically comparable to real exam questions, validating the model's effectiveness. AWE offers a promising path toward reducing teacher workload, enhancing instructional quality, and enabling broader educational innovation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various domains. However, a fundamental question remains: Can LLMs effectively utilize causal knowledge for prediction and generation? Through empirical studies, we find that LLMs trained directly on large-scale data often capture spurious correlations rather than true causal relationships, leading to suboptimal performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose Causal Attention Tuning (CAT), a novel approach that injects fine-grained causal knowledge into the attention mechanism. We propose an automated pipeline that leverages human priors to automatically generate token-level causal signals and introduce the Re-Attention mechanism to guide training, helping the model focus on causal structures while mitigating noise and biases in attention scores. Experimental results on our proposed Spurious Token Game (STG) benchmark and multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that our approach effectively leverages causal knowledge for prediction and remains robust in OOD scenarios. Implementation details can be found at https://github.com/Kairong-Han/CAT.

Abstract: General-purpose vision-language models (VLMs) have emerged as promising tools in radiology, offering zero-shot capabilities that mitigate the need for large labeled datasets. However, in high-stakes domains like diagnostic radiology, these models often lack the discriminative precision required for reliable clinical use. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and heterogeneity of publicly available volumetric CT datasets, which vary widely in annotation formats and granularity. To address these limitations, we introduce Uniferum, a volumetric VLM that unifies diverse supervision signals, encoded in classification labels and segmentation masks, into a single training framework. By harmonizing three public 3D CT datasets with distinct annotations, Uniferum achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC on the CT-RATE benchmark by 7% compared to CLIP-based and conventional multi-label convolutional models. The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, with observed evidence of unexpected zero-shot performance on the RAD-CHEST and INSPECT datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating heterogeneous annotations and body segmentation to enhance model performance, setting a new direction for clinically reliable, data-efficient VLMs in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Tool agents -- LLM-based systems that interact with external APIs -- offer a way to execute real-world tasks. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, these agents struggle to identify and call the correct APIs in the proper order. To tackle this problem, we investigate converting API documentation into a structured API graph that captures API dependencies and leveraging it for multi-tool queries that require compositional API calls. To support this, we introduce In-N-Out, the first expert-annotated dataset of API graphs built from two real-world API benchmarks and their documentation. Using In-N-Out significantly improves performance on both tool retrieval and multi-tool query generation, nearly doubling that of LLMs using documentation alone. Moreover, graphs generated by models fine-tuned on In-N-Out close 90% of this gap, showing that our dataset helps models learn to comprehend API documentation and parameter relationships. Our findings highlight the promise of using explicit API graphs for tool agents and the utility of In-N-Out as a valuable resource. We will release the dataset and code publicly.

Abstract: Trisomy 21 results in Down syndrome, a multifaceted genetic disorder with diverse clinical phenotypes, including heart defects, immune dysfunction, neurodevelopmental differences, and early-onset dementia risk. Heterogeneity and fragmented data across studies challenge comprehensive research and translational discovery. The NIH INCLUDE (INvestigation of Co-occurring conditions across the Lifespan to Understand Down syndromE) initiative has assembled harmonized participant-level datasets, yet realizing their potential requires integrative analytical frameworks. We developed a knowledge graph-driven platform transforming nine INCLUDE studies, comprising 7,148 participants, 456 conditions, 501 phenotypes, and over 37,000 biospecimens, into a unified semantic infrastructure. Cross-resource enrichment with Monarch Initiative data expands coverage to 4,281 genes and 7,077 variants. The resulting knowledge graph contains over 1.6 million semantic associations, enabling AI-ready analysis with graph embeddings and path-based reasoning for hypothesis generation. Researchers can query the graph via SPARQL or natural language interfaces. This framework converts static data repositories into dynamic discovery environments, supporting cross-study pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and systematic exploration of genotype-phenotype relationships in Down syndrome.

<title>One-Shot Clustering for Federated Learning Under Clustering-Agnostic Assumption</title>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a widespread and well-adopted paradigm of decentralised learning that allows training one model from multiple sources without the need to transfer data between participating clients directly. Since its inception in 2015, it has been divided into numerous subfields that deal with application-specific issues, such as data heterogeneity or resource allocation. One such sub-field, Clustered Federated Learning (CFL), deals with the problem of clustering the population of clients into separate cohorts to deliver personalised models. Although a few remarkable works have been published in this domain, the problem remains largely unexplored, as its basic assumptions and settings differ slightly from those of standard FL. In this work, we present One-Shot Clustered Federated Learning (OCFL), a clustering-agnostic algorithm that can automatically detect the earliest suitable moment for clustering. Our algorithm is based on computing the cosine distance between the gradients of the clients and a temperature measure that detects when the federated model starts to converge. We empirically evaluate our methodology by testing various one-shot clustering algorithms for over forty different tasks on five benchmark datasets. Our experiments showcase the good performance of our approach when used to perform CFL in an automated manner without the need to adjust hyperparameters. We also revisit the practical feasibility of CFL algorithms based on the gradients of the clients, providing firm evidence of the high efficiency of density-based clustering methods when used to differentiate between the loss surfaces of neural networks trained on different distributions. Moreover, by inspecting the feasibility of local explanations generated with the help of GradCAM, we can provide more insights into the relationship between personalisation and the explainability of local predictions.

Abstract: Audio Chord Estimation (ACE) holds a pivotal role in music information research, having garnered attention for over two decades due to its relevance for music transcription and analysis. Despite notable advancements, challenges persist in the task, particularly concerning unique characteristics of harmonic content, which have resulted in existing systems' performances reaching a glass ceiling. These challenges include annotator subjectivity, where varying interpretations among annotators lead to inconsistencies, and class imbalance within chord datasets, where certain chord classes are over-represented compared to others, posing difficulties in model training and evaluation. As a first contribution, this paper presents an evaluation of inter-annotator agreement in chord annotations, using metrics that extend beyond traditional binary measures. In addition, we propose a consonance-informed distance metric that reflects the perceptual similarity between harmonic annotations. Our analysis suggests that consonance-based distance metrics more effectively capture musically meaningful agreement between annotations. Expanding on these findings, we introduce a novel ACE conformer-based model that integrates consonance concepts into the model through consonance-based label smoothing. The proposed model also addresses class imbalance by separately estimating root, bass, and all note activations, enabling the reconstruction of chord labels from decomposed outputs.

Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) play a vital role in ensuring public safety across various settings, from nuclear facilities to medical environments. However, these systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as data injection, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, ICMP floods, botnet attacks, privilege escalation, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Such threats could compromise the integrity and reliability of radiation measurements, posing significant public health and safety risks. This paper presents a new synthetic radiation dataset and an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for resource-constrained environments, bringing Machine Learning (ML) predictive capabilities closer to the sensing edge layer of critical infrastructure. Leveraging TinyML techniques, the proposed IDS employs an optimized XGBoost model enhanced with pruning, quantization, feature selection, and sampling. These TinyML techniques significantly reduce the size of the model and computational demands, enabling real-time intrusion detection on low-resource devices while maintaining a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video editing, yet controllable editing remains challenging due to the need for precise manipulation of diverse object properties. Current methods require different control signal for diverse editing tasks, which complicates model design and demands significant training resources. To address this, we propose O-DisCo-Edit, a unified framework that incorporates a novel object distortion control (O-DisCo). This signal, based on random and adaptive noise, flexibly encapsulates a wide range of editing cues within a single representation. Paired with a "copy-form" preservation module for preserving non-edited regions, O-DisCo-Edit enables efficient, high-fidelity editing through an effective training paradigm. Extensive experiments and comprehensive human evaluations consistently demonstrate that O-DisCo-Edit surpasses both specialized and multitask state-of-the-art methods across various video editing tasks. https://cyqii.github.io/O-DisCo-Edit.github.io/

Abstract: Radiation Detection Systems (RDSs) are used to measure and detect abnormal levels of radioactive material in the environment. These systems are used in many applications to mitigate threats posed by high levels of radioactive material. However, these systems lack protection against malicious external attacks to modify the data. The novelty of applying Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) in RDSs is a crucial element in safeguarding these critical infrastructures. While IDSs are widely used in networking environments to safeguard against various attacks, their application in RDSs is novel. A common attack on RDSs is Denial of Service (DoS), where the attacker aims to overwhelm the system, causing malfunctioning RDSs. This paper proposes an efficient Machine Learning (ML)-based IDS to detect anomalies in radiation data, focusing on DoS attacks. This work explores the use of sampling methods to create a simulated DoS attack based on a real radiation dataset, followed by an evaluation of various ML algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), logistic regression, and Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), to detect DoS attacks on RDSs. LightGBM is emphasized for its superior accuracy and low computational resource consumption, making it particularly suitable for real-time intrusion detection. Additionally, model optimization and TinyML techniques, including feature selection, parallel execution, and random search methods, are used to improve the efficiency of the proposed IDS. Finally, an optimized and efficient LightGBM-based IDS is developed to achieve accurate intrusion detection for RDSs.

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of multitask deep learning models has enhanced catheterization procedures by providing tactile and visual perception data through an end-to-end architec- ture. This information is derived from a segmentation and force estimation head, which localizes the catheter in X-ray images and estimates the applied pressure based on its deflection within the image. These stereo vision architectures incorporate a CNN- based encoder-decoder that captures the dependencies between X-ray images from two viewpoints, enabling simultaneous 3D force estimation and stereo segmentation of the catheter. With these tasks in mind, this work approaches the problem from a new perspective. We propose a novel encoder-decoder Vision Transformer model that processes two input X-ray images as separate sequences. Given sequences of X-ray patches from two perspectives, the transformer captures long-range dependencies without the need to gradually expand the receptive field for either image. The embeddings generated by both the encoder and decoder are fed into two shared segmentation heads, while a regression head employs the fused information from the decoder for 3D force estimation. The proposed model is a stereo Vision Transformer capable of simultaneously segmenting the catheter from two angles while estimating the generated forces at its tip in 3D. This model has undergone extensive experiments on synthetic X-ray images with various noise levels and has been compared against state-of-the-art pure segmentation models, vision-based catheter force estimation methods, and a multitask catheter segmentation and force estimation approach. It outperforms existing models, setting a new state-of-the-art in both catheter segmentation and force estimation.

Abstract: The increasing availability of big mobility data from ubiquitous portable devices enables human mobility prediction through deep learning approaches. However, the diverse complexity of human mobility data impedes model training, leading to inefficient gradient updates and potential underfitting. Meanwhile, exclusively predicting next locations neglects implicit determinants, including distances and directions, thereby yielding suboptimal prediction results. This paper presents a unified training framework that integrates entropy-driven curriculum and multi-task learning to address these challenges. The proposed entropy-driven curriculum learning strategy quantifies trajectory predictability based on Lempel-Ziv compression and organizes training from simple to complex for faster convergence and enhanced performance. The multi-task training simultaneously optimizes the primary location prediction alongside auxiliary estimation of movement distance and direction for learning realistic mobility patterns, and improve prediction accuracy through complementary supervision signals. Extensive experiments conducted in accordance with the HuMob Challenge demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEO-BLEU (0.354) and DTW (26.15) metrics with up to 2.92-fold convergence speed compared to training without curriculum learning.

Abstract: If one looks at contemporary mainstream development practices for conceptual modelling in computer science, these so clearly focus on a conceptual schema completely separated from its information base that the conceptual schema is often just called the conceptual model. These schema-centric practices are crystallized in almost every database textbook. We call this strong, almost universal, bias towards conceptual schemas the schema turn. The focus of this paper is on disentangling this turn within (computer science) conceptual modeling. It aims to shed some light on how it emerged and so show that it is not fundamental. To show that modern technology enables the adoption of an inclusive schema-and-base conceptual modelling approach, which in turn enables more automated, and empirically motivated practices. And to show, more generally, the space of possible conceptual modelling practices is wider than currently assumed. It also uses the example of bCLEARer to show that the implementations in this wider space will probably need to rely on new pipeline-based conceptual modelling techniques. So, it is possible that the schema turn's complete exclusion of the information base could be merely a temporary evolutionary detour.

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced large language models (LLMs) has made AI-generated text indistinguishable from human-written text. Previous work on detecting AI-generated text has made effective progress, but has not involved modern Chinese poetry. Due to the distinctive characteristics of modern Chinese poetry, it is difficult to identify whether a poem originated from humans or AI. The proliferation of AI-generated modern Chinese poetry has significantly disrupted the poetry ecosystem. Based on the urgency of identifying AI-generated poetry in the real Chinese world, this paper proposes a novel benchmark for detecting LLMs-generated modern Chinese poetry. We first construct a high-quality dataset, which includes both 800 poems written by six professional poets and 41,600 poems generated by four mainstream LLMs. Subsequently, we conduct systematic performance assessments of six detectors on this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that current detectors cannot be used as reliable tools to detect modern Chinese poems generated by LLMs. The most difficult poetic features to detect are intrinsic qualities, especially style. The detection results verify the effectiveness and necessity of our proposed benchmark. Our work lays a foundation for future detection of AI-generated poetry.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models are computationally intensive, often requiring dozens of forward passes through large transformer backbones. For instance, Stable Diffusion XL generates high-quality images with 50 evaluations of a 2.6B-parameter model, an expensive process even for a single batch. Few-step diffusion models reduce this cost to 2-8 denoising steps but still depend on large, uncompressed U-Net or diffusion transformer backbones, which are often too costly for full-precision inference without datacenter GPUs. These requirements also limit existing post-training quantization methods that rely on full-precision calibration. We introduce Q-Sched, a new paradigm for post-training quantization that modifies the diffusion model scheduler rather than model weights. By adjusting the few-step sampling trajectory, Q-Sched achieves full-precision accuracy with a 4x reduction in model size. To learn quantization-aware pre-conditioning coefficients, we propose the JAQ loss, which combines text-image compatibility with an image quality metric for fine-grained optimization. JAQ is reference-free and requires only a handful of calibration prompts, avoiding full-precision inference during calibration. Q-Sched delivers substantial gains: a 15.5% FID improvement over the FP16 4-step Latent Consistency Model and a 16.6% improvement over the FP16 8-step Phased Consistency Model, showing that quantization and few-step distillation are complementary for high-fidelity generation. A large-scale user study with more than 80,000 annotations further confirms Q-Sched's effectiveness on both FLUX.1[schnell] and SDXL-Turbo.

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion model, termed the non-identical diffusion model, and investigate its application to wireless orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channel generation. Unlike the standard diffusion model that uses a scalar-valued time index to represent the global noise level, we extend this notion to an element-wise time indicator to capture local error variations more accurately. Non-identical diffusion enables us to characterize the reliability of each element (e.g., subcarriers in OFDM) within the noisy input, leading to improved generation results when the initialization is biased. Specifically, we focus on the recovery of wireless multi-input multi-output (MIMO) OFDM channel matrices, where the initial channel estimates exhibit highly uneven reliability across elements due to the pilot scheme. Conventional time embeddings, which assume uniform noise progression, fail to capture such variability across pilot schemes and noise levels. We introduce a matrix that matches the input size to control element-wise noise progression. Following a similar diffusion procedure to existing methods, we show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed non-identical diffusion scheme both theoretically and numerically. For MIMO-OFDM channel generation, we propose a dimension-wise time embedding strategy. We also develop and evaluate multiple training and generation methods and compare them through numerical experiments.

Abstract: While large-scale robot datasets have propelled recent progress in imitation learning, learning from smaller task specific datasets remains critical for deployment in new environments and unseen tasks. One such approach to few-shot imitation learning is retrieval-based imitation learning, which extracts relevant samples from large, widely available prior datasets to augment a limited demonstration dataset. To determine the relevant data from prior datasets, retrieval-based approaches most commonly calculate a prior data point's minimum distance to a point in the target dataset in latent space. While retrieval-based methods have shown success using this metric for data selection, we demonstrate its equivalence to the limit of a Gaussian kernel density (KDE) estimate of the target data distribution. This reveals two shortcomings of the retrieval rule used in prior work. First, it relies on high-variance nearest neighbor estimates that are susceptible to noise. Second, it does not account for the distribution of prior data when retrieving data. To address these issues, we introduce Importance Weighted Retrieval (IWR), which estimates importance weights, or the ratio between the target and prior data distributions for retrieval, using Gaussian KDEs. By considering the probability ratio, IWR seeks to mitigate the bias of previous selection rules, and by using reasonable modeling parameters, IWR effectively smooths estimates using all data points. Across both simulation environments and real-world evaluations on the Bridge dataset we find that our method, IWR, consistently improves performance of existing retrieval-based methods, despite only requiring minor modifications.

Abstract: Existing agents for solving tasks such as ML engineering rely on prompting powerful language models. As a result, these agents do not improve with more experience. In this paper, we show that agents backed by weaker models that improve via reinforcement learning (RL) can outperform agents backed by much larger, but static models. We identify two major challenges with RL in this setting. First, actions can take a variable amount of time (e.g., executing code for different solutions), which leads to asynchronous policy gradient updates that favor faster but suboptimal solutions. To tackle variable-duration actions, we propose duration- aware gradient updates in a distributed asynchronous RL framework to amplify high-cost but high-reward actions. Second, using only test split performance as a reward provides limited feedback. A program that is nearly correct is treated the same as one that fails entirely. To address this, we propose environment instrumentation to offer partial credit, distinguishing almost-correct programs from those that fail early (e.g., during data loading). Environment instrumentation uses a separate static language model to insert print statement to an existing program to log the agent's experimental progress, from which partial credit can be extracted as reward signals for learning. Our experimental results on MLEBench suggest that performing gradient updates on a much smaller model (Qwen2.5-3B) trained with RL outperforms prompting a much larger model (Claude-3.5-Sonnet) with agent scaffolds, by an average of 22% across 12 Kaggle tasks.

Abstract: Accurate classification of rock sizes is a vital component in geotechnical engineering, mining, and resource management, where precise estimation influences operational efficiency and safety. In this paper, we propose an enhanced deep learning model based on the ConvNeXt architecture, augmented with both self-attention and channel attention mechanisms. Building upon the foundation of ConvNext, our proposed model, termed CNSCA, introduces self-attention to capture long-range spatial dependencies and channel attention to emphasize informative feature channels. This hybrid design enables the model to effectively capture both fine-grained local patterns and broader contextual relationships within rock imagery, leading to improved classification accuracy and robustness. We evaluate our model on a rock size classification dataset and compare it against three strong baseline. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of attention mechanisms significantly enhances the models capability for fine-grained classification tasks involving natural textures like rocks.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have substantially advanced natural language processing by providing context-sensitive text representations. However, the Algerian dialect remains under-represented, with few dedicated models available. Processing this dialect is challenging due to its complex morphology, frequent code-switching, multiple scripts, and strong lexical influences from other languages. These characteristics complicate tokenization and reduce the effectiveness of conventional word- or subword-level approaches.
  To address this gap, we introduce chDzDT, a character-level pre-trained language model tailored for Algerian morphology. Unlike conventional PLMs that rely on token sequences, chDzDT is trained on isolated words. This design allows the model to encode morphological patterns robustly, without depending on token boundaries or standardized orthography. The training corpus draws from diverse sources, including YouTube comments, French, English, and Berber Wikipedia, as well as the Tatoeba project. It covers multiple scripts and linguistic varieties, resulting in a substantial pre-training workload.
  Our contributions are threefold: (i) a detailed morphological analysis of Algerian dialect using YouTube comments; (ii) the construction of a multilingual Algerian lexicon dataset; and (iii) the development and extensive evaluation of a character-level PLM as a morphology-focused encoder for downstream tasks. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of character-level modeling for morphologically rich, low-resource dialects and lays a foundation for more inclusive and adaptable NLP systems.

<title>AHAMask: Reliable Task Specification for Large Audio Language Models without Instructions</title>

Abstract: Although current large audio language models (LALMs) extend text large language models (LLMs) with generic acoustic understanding abilities, they usually suffer from instruction sensitivity, where different instructions of the same intention can yield drastically different outcomes. In this work, we propose AHAMask, where we simply mask some of the attention heads in the decoder-only LLM backbone of LALMs, to trigger specific acoustic task functionalities without instructions. These masks are efficiently obtained by training on an LALM, with the number of trainable parameters equal to the attention head count in its LLM backbone. We show by experiments that applying such selective attention head masks achieves comparable or even better performance than using instructions, either on single or composite tasks. Besides achieving reliable acoustic task specification for LALMs, this also reveals that LALMs exhibit certain "functional pathways" in their attention heads.

<title>Flaw or Artifact? Rethinking Prompt Sensitivity in Evaluating LLMs</title>

Abstract: Prompt sensitivity, referring to the phenomenon where paraphrasing (i.e., repeating something written or spoken using different words) leads to significant changes in large language model (LLM) performance, has been widely accepted as a core limitation of LLMs. In this work, we revisit this issue and ask: Is the widely reported high prompt sensitivity truly an inherent weakness of LLMs, or is it largely an artifact of evaluation processes? To answer this question, we systematically evaluate 7 LLMs (e.g., GPT and Gemini family) across 6 benchmarks, including both multiple-choice and open-ended tasks on 12 diverse prompt templates. We find that much of the prompt sensitivity stems from heuristic evaluation methods, including log-likelihood scoring and rigid answer matching, which often overlook semantically correct responses expressed through alternative phrasings, such as synonyms or paraphrases. When we adopt LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations, we observe a substantial reduction in performance variance and a consistently higher correlation in model rankings across prompts. Our findings suggest that modern LLMs are more robust to prompt templates than previously believed, and that prompt sensitivity may be more an artifact of evaluation than a flaw in the models.

Abstract: Every day, our inboxes are flooded with unsolicited emails, ranging between annoying spam to more subtle phishing scams. Unfortunately, despite abundant prior efforts proposing solutions achieving near-perfect accuracy, the reality is that countering malicious emails still remains an unsolved dilemma.
  This "open problem" paper carries out a critical assessment of scientific works in the context of phishing email detection. First, we focus on the benchmark datasets that have been used to assess the methods proposed in research. We find that most prior work relied on datasets containing emails that -- we argue -- are not representative of current trends, and mostly encompass the English language. Based on this finding, we then re-implement and re-assess a variety of detection methods reliant on machine learning (ML), including large-language models (LLM), and release all of our codebase -- an (unfortunately) uncommon practice in related research. We show that most such methods achieve near-perfect performance when trained and tested on the same dataset -- a result which intrinsically hinders development (how can future research outperform methods that are already near perfect?). To foster the creation of "more challenging benchmarks" that reflect current phishing trends, we propose E-PhishGEN, an LLM-based (and privacy-savvy) framework to generate novel phishing-email datasets. We use our E-PhishGEN to create E-PhishLLM, a novel phishing-email detection dataset containing 16616 emails in three languages. We use E-PhishLLM to test the detectors we considered, showing a much lower performance than that achieved on existing benchmarks -- indicating a larger room for improvement. We also validate the quality of E-PhishLLM with a user study (n=30). To sum up, we show that phishing email detection is still an open problem -- and provide the means to tackle such a problem by future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents have achieved strong results on benchmarks such as Atari100k, yet they remain limited in robustness to real-world conditions. Model-Based RL approaches that rely on learned World Models often struggle in environments with true stochasticity and partial observability, despite their theoretical grounding in POMDPs. Current benchmarks rarely capture these challenges, focusing instead on deterministic or overly simplified settings, and the lack of a clear taxonomy of stochasticity further hampers systematic evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce STORI (STOchastic-ataRI), a benchmark that incorporates diverse stochastic effects and enables rigorous assessment of RL methods under varied forms of uncertainty. In addition, we propose a taxonomy of stochasticity in RL environments, providing a unified framework for analyzing and comparing approaches.

<title>A Multi-target Bayesian Transformer Framework for Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Biomarkers during Pandemics</title>

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide, disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning (ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns, and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties, embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887, RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support clinical decision-making during pandemics.

Abstract: Intrusion detection in unmanned-aerial-vehicle (UAV) swarms is complicated by high mobility, non-stationary traffic, and severe class imbalance. Leveraging a 120 k-flow simulation corpus that covers five attack types, we benchmark three quantum-machine-learning (QML) approaches - quantum kernels, variational quantum neural networks (QNNs), and hybrid quantum-trained neural networks (QT-NNs) - against strong classical baselines. All models consume an 8-feature flow representation and are evaluated under identical preprocessing, balancing, and noise-model assumptions. We analyse the influence of encoding strategy, circuit depth, qubit count, and shot noise, reporting accuracy, macro-F1, ROC-AUC, Matthews correlation, and quantum-resource footprints. Results reveal clear trade-offs: quantum kernels and QT-NNs excel in low-data, nonlinear regimes, while deeper QNNs suffer from trainability issues, and CNNs dominate when abundant data offset their larger parameter count. The complete codebase and dataset partitions are publicly released to enable reproducible QML research in network security.

Abstract: Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have paved the way for "AI interviewers" that can administer voice-based surveys with respondents in real-time. This position paper reviews emerging evidence to understand when such AI interviewing systems are fit for purpose for collecting data within quantitative and qualitative research contexts. We evaluate the capabilities of AI interviewers as well as current Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems across two dimensions: input/output performance (i.e., speech recognition, answer recording, emotion handling) and verbal reasoning (i.e., ability to probe, clarify, and handle branching logic). Field studies suggest that AI interviewers already exceed IVR capabilities for both quantitative and qualitative data collection, but real-time transcription error rates, limited emotion detection abilities, and uneven follow-up quality indicate that the utility, use and adoption of current AI interviewer technology may be context-dependent for qualitative data collection efforts.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their application to time series analysis tasks. However, their ability to perform complex reasoning over temporal data in real-world application domains remains underexplored. To move toward this goal, a first step is to establish a rigorous benchmark dataset for evaluation. In this work, we introduce the TSAIA Benchmark, a first attempt to evaluate LLMs as time-series AI assistants. To ensure both scientific rigor and practical relevance, we surveyed over 20 academic publications and identified 33 real-world task formulations. The benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of challenges, ranging from constraint-aware forecasting to anomaly detection with threshold calibration: tasks that require compositional reasoning and multi-step time series analysis. The question generator is designed to be dynamic and extensible, supporting continuous expansion as new datasets or task types are introduced. Given the heterogeneous nature of the tasks, we adopt task-specific success criteria and tailored inference-quality metrics to ensure meaningful evaluation for each task. We apply this benchmark to assess eight state-of-the-art LLMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our analysis reveals limitations in current models' ability to assemble complex time series analysis workflows, underscoring the need for specialized methodologies for domain-specific adaptation. Our benchmark is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Melady/TSAIA, and the code is available at https://github.com/USC-Melady/TSAIA.

Abstract: This study examines journalists' perceptions of the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on disinformation, a growing concern in journalism due to the rapid expansion of generative AI and its influence on news production and media organizations. Using a quantitative approach, a structured survey was administered to 504 journalists in the Basque Country, identified through official media directories and with the support of the Basque Association of Journalists. This survey, conducted online and via telephone between May and June 2024, included questions on sociodemographic and professional variables, as well as attitudes toward AI's impact on journalism. The results indicate that a large majority of journalists (89.88%) believe AI will considerably or significantly increase the risks of disinformation, and this perception is consistent across genders and media types, but more pronounced among those with greater professional experience. Statistical analyses reveal a significant association between years of experience and perceived risk, and between AI use and risk perception. The main risks identified are the difficulty in detecting false content and deepfakes, and the risk of obtaining inaccurate or erroneous data. Co-occurrence analysis shows that these risks are often perceived as interconnected. These findings highlight the complex and multifaceted concerns of journalists regarding AI's role in the information ecosystem.

Abstract: Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is essential for enhancing situational awareness and preventing collisions. Still, existing data-driven models are constrained mainly to single-vessel forecasting, overlooking vessel interactions, navigation rules, and explicit collision risk assessment. We present a transformer-based framework for multi-vessel trajectory prediction with integrated collision risk analysis. For a given target vessel, the framework identifies nearby vessels. It jointly predicts their future trajectories through parallel streams encoding kinematic and derived physical features, causal convolutions for temporal locality, spatial transformations for positional encoding, and hybrid positional embeddings that capture both local motion patterns and long-range dependencies. Evaluated on large-scale real-world AIS data using joint multi-vessel metrics, the model demonstrates superior forecasting capabilities beyond traditional single-vessel displacement errors. By simulating interactions among predicted trajectories, the framework further quantifies potential collision risks, offering actionable insights to strengthen maritime safety and decision support.

Abstract: Routing vessels through narrow and dynamic waterways is challenging due to changing environmental conditions and operational constraints. Existing vessel-routing studies typically fail to generalize across multiple origin-destination pairs and do not exploit large-scale, data-driven traffic graphs. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning solution for big maritime data that can learn to find a route across multiple origin-destination pairs while adapting to different hexagonal grid resolutions. Agents learn to select direction and speed under continuous observations in a multi-discrete action space. A reward function balances fuel efficiency, travel time, wind resistance, and route diversity, using an Automatic Identification System (AIS)-derived traffic graph with ERA5 wind fields. The approach is demonstrated in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, one of the largest estuaries in the world. We evaluate configurations that combine Proximal Policy Optimization with recurrent networks, invalid-action masking, and exploration strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that action masking yields a clear improvement in policy performance and that supplementing penalty-only feedback with positive shaping rewards produces additional gains.

Abstract: Currently, prominent Transformer architectures applied on graphs and meshes for shape analysis tasks employ traditional attention layers that heavily utilize spectral features requiring costly eigenvalue decomposition-based methods. To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional embeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations, e.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then concatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach inspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in Discrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and exterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \star_0^{-1} d_0^T \star_1 d_0)$. We adjust the Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the multi-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\star_0$, $\star_1$ and $\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act on mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a computationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in mesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning framework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition operations or complex preprocessing operations.

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose GradES, a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning. GradES tracks the magnitude of gradients in backpropagation for these matrices during training. When a projection matrix's gradients fall below a convergence threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow converging matrices to continue learning. By strategically freezing parameters when their gradients converge, GradES speeds up training time by 1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2% higher average accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents an overview of a human-centered initiative aimed at strengthening climate resilience along Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore. This region, a collection of rural villages with deep ties to the sea, faces existential threats from climate change that endanger its way of life. Our project moves beyond a purely technical response, weaving together expertise from Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, and Coastal Geography to co-create tools with the community. By integrating generational knowledge of residents, particularly elders, through the Eastern Shore Citizen Science Coastal Monitoring Network, this project aims to collaborate in building a living digital archive. This effort is hosted under Dalhousie University's Transforming Climate Action (TCA) initiative, specifically through its Transformative Adaptations to Social-Ecological Climate Change Trajectories (TranSECT) and TCA Artificial Intelligence (TCA-AI) projects. This work is driven by a collaboration model in which student teams work directly with residents. We present a detailed project timeline and a replicable model for how technology can support traditional communities, enabling them to navigate climate transformation more effectively.

Abstract: Modern deep learning developments create new opportunities for 3D mapping technology, scene reconstruction pipelines, and virtual reality development. Despite advances in 3D deep learning technology, direct training of deep learning models on 3D data faces challenges due to the high dimensionality inherent in 3D data and the scarcity of labeled datasets. Structure-from-motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) exhibit robust performance when applied to structured indoor environments but often struggle with ambiguous features in unstructured environments. These techniques often struggle to generate detailed geometric representations effective for downstream tasks such as rendering and semantic analysis. Current limitations require the development of 3D representation methods that combine traditional geometric techniques with deep learning capabilities to generate robust geometry-aware deep learning models.
  The dissertation provides solutions to the fundamental challenges in 3D vision by developing geometric deep learning methods tailored for essential tasks such as camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth prediction, and 3D reconstruction. The integration of geometric priors or constraints, such as including depth information, surface normals, and equivariance into deep learning models, enhances both the accuracy and robustness of geometric representations. This study systematically investigates key components of 3D vision, including camera pose estimation, point cloud registration, depth estimation, and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, demonstrating their effectiveness across real-world applications such as digital cultural heritage preservation and immersive VR/AR environments.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of machine learning models is critical for ensuring their reliability and robustness. Whilst many techniques in mechanistic interpretability focus on activation driven analyses, being able to derive meaningful features directly from the weights of a neural network would provide greater guarantees and more computational efficiency. Existing techniques for analyzing model features through weights suffer from drawbacks such as reduced performance and data inefficiency. In this paper, we introduce Signed Quadratic Shrink (SQS), an activation function designed to allow Gated Linear Units (GLUs) to learn interpretable features without these drawbacks. Our experimental results show that SQS achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art activation functions whilst enabling weight-based interpretability

Abstract: Ongoing advancements in computer vision, particularly in pattern recognition and scene classification, have enabled new applications in environmental monitoring. Deep learning now offers non-contact methods for assessing water quality and detecting contamination, both critical for disaster response and public health protection. This work introduces HydroVision, a deep learning-based scene classification framework that estimates optically active water quality parameters including Chlorophyll-Alpha, Chlorophylls, Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), Phycocyanins, Suspended Sediments, and Turbidity from standard Red-Green-Blue (RGB) images of surface water. HydroVision supports early detection of contamination trends and strengthens monitoring by regulatory agencies during external environmental stressors, industrial activities, and force majeure events. The model is trained on more than 500,000 seasonally varied images collected from the United States Geological Survey Hydrologic Imagery Visualization and Information System between 2022 and 2024. This approach leverages widely available RGB imagery as a scalable, cost-effective alternative to traditional multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing. Four state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (VGG-16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121) and a Vision Transformer are evaluated through transfer learning to identify the best-performing architecture. DenseNet121 achieves the highest validation performance, with an R2 score of 0.89 in predicting CDOM, demonstrating the framework's promise for real-world water quality monitoring across diverse conditions. While the current model is optimized for well-lit imagery, future work will focus on improving robustness under low-light and obstructed scenarios to expand its operational utility.

Abstract: The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics. This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs, thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing patient care outcomes.

Abstract: We propose VISP: Volatility Informed Stochastic Projection, an adaptive regularization method that leverages gradient volatility to guide stochastic noise injection in deep neural networks. Unlike conventional techniques that apply uniform noise or fixed dropout rates, VISP dynamically computes volatility from gradient statistics and uses it to scale a stochastic projection matrix. This mechanism selectively regularizes inputs and hidden nodes that exhibit higher gradient volatility while preserving stable representations, thereby mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and SVHN demonstrate that VISP consistently improves generalization performance over baseline models and fixed-noise alternatives. In addition, detailed analyses of the evolution of volatility, the spectral properties of the projection matrix, and activation distributions reveal that VISP not only stabilizes the internal dynamics of the network but also fosters a more robust feature representation.

Abstract: Worldwide geo-localization involves determining the exact geographic location of images captured globally, typically guided by geographic cues such as climate, landmarks, and architectural styles. Despite advancements in geo-localization models like GeoCLIP, which leverages images and location alignment via contrastive learning for accurate predictions, the interpretability of these models remains insufficiently explored. Current concept-based interpretability methods fail to align effectively with Geo-alignment image-location embedding objectives, resulting in suboptimal interpretability and performance. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework integrating global geo-localization with concept bottlenecks. Our method inserts a Concept-Aware Alignment Module that jointly projects image and location embeddings onto a shared bank of geographic concepts (e.g., tropical climate, mountain, cathedral) and minimizes a concept-level loss, enhancing alignment in a concept-specific subspace and enabling robust interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce interpretability into geo-localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses GeoCLIP in geo-localization accuracy and boosts performance across diverse geospatial prediction tasks, revealing richer semantic insights into geographic decision-making processes.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is an attractive approach to automate the design of optimized architectures but is constrained by high computational budget, especially when optimizing for multiple, important conflicting objectives. To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.

Abstract: Multimodal models, such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, have demonstrated remarkable success in aligning visual and linguistic representations. However, these models exhibit limitations when applied to specialised visual domains, such as diagrams, which encode structured, symbolic information distinct from that of natural imagery.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel training paradigm explicitly designed to enhance the comprehension of diagrammatic images within vision-language models. Our approach uses ``hard'' samples for our proposed contrastive learning that incorporates two specialised loss functions that leverage the inherent structural properties of diagrams. By integrating these objectives into model training, our method enables models to develop a more structured and semantically coherent understanding of diagrammatic content.
  We empirically validate our approach on a benchmark dataset of flowcharts, as a representative class of diagrammatic imagery, demonstrating substantial improvements over standard CLIP and conventional hard negative CLIP learning paradigms for both image-text matching and visual question answering tasks. Our findings underscore the significance of tailored training strategies for specialised tasks and contribute to advancing diagrammatic understanding within the broader landscape of vision-language integration.

<title>2D Gaussian Splatting with Semantic Alignment for Image Inpainting</title>

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS), a recent technique for converting discrete points into continuous spatial representations, has shown promising results in 3D scene modeling and 2D image super-resolution. In this paper, we explore its untapped potential for image inpainting, which demands both locally coherent pixel synthesis and globally consistent semantic restoration. We propose the first image inpainting framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting, which encodes incomplete images into a continuous field of 2D Gaussian splat coefficients and reconstructs the final image via a differentiable rasterization process. The continuous rendering paradigm of GS inherently promotes pixel-level coherence in the inpainted results. To improve efficiency and scalability, we introduce a patch-wise rasterization strategy that reduces memory overhead and accelerates inference. For global semantic consistency, we incorporate features from a pretrained DINO model. We observe that DINO's global features are naturally robust to small missing regions and can be effectively adapted to guide semantic alignment in large-mask scenarios, ensuring that the inpainted content remains contextually consistent with the surrounding scene. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality, establishing a new direction for applying Gaussian Splatting to 2D image processing.

<title>Draw-In-Mind: Learning Precise Image Editing via Chain-of-Thought Imagination</title>

Abstract: In recent years, integrating multimodal understanding and generation into a single unified model has emerged as a promising paradigm. While this approach achieves strong results in text-to-image (T2I) generation, it still struggles with precise image editing. We attribute this limitation to an imbalanced division of responsibilities. The understanding module primarily functions as a translator that encodes user instructions into semantic conditions, while the generation module must simultaneously act as designer and painter, inferring the original layout, identifying the target editing region, and rendering the new content. This imbalance is counterintuitive because the understanding module is typically trained with several times more data on complex reasoning tasks than the generation module. To address this issue, we introduce Draw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i) DIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex instruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K chain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design blueprints for image edits. We connect a frozen Qwen2.5-VL-3B with a trainable SANA1.5-1.6B via a lightweight two-layer MLP, and train it on the proposed DIM dataset, resulting in DIM-4.6B-T2I/Edit. Despite its modest parameter scale, DIM-4.6B-Edit achieves SOTA or competitive performance on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks, outperforming much larger models such as UniWorld-V1 and Step1X-Edit. These findings demonstrate that explicitly assigning the design responsibility to the understanding module provides significant benefits for image editing. Our dataset and models will be available at https://github.com/showlab/DIM.

Abstract: Logistical demand-supply forecasting that evaluates the alignment between projected supply and anticipated demand, is essential for the efficiency and quality of on-demand food delivery platforms and serves as a key indicator for scheduling decisions. Future order distribution information, which reflects the distribution of orders in on-demand food delivery, is crucial for the performance of logistical demand-supply forecasting. Current studies utilize spatial-temporal analysis methods to model future order distribution information from serious time slices. However, learning future order distribution in online delivery platform is a time-series-insensitive problem with strong randomness. These approaches often struggle to effectively capture this information while remaining efficient. This paper proposes an innovative spatiotemporal learning model that utilizes only two graphs (ongoing and global) to learn future order distribution information, achieving superior performance compared to traditional spatial-temporal long-series methods. The main contributions are as follows: (1) The introduction of ongoing and global graphs in logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting compared to traditional long time series significantly enhances forecasting performance. (2) An innovative graph learning network framework using adaptive future graph learning and innovative cross attention mechanism (ACA-Net) is proposed to extract future order distribution information, effectively learning a robust future graph that substantially improves logistical demand-supply pressure forecasting outcomes. (3) The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in real-world production environments.

<title>Empowering Large Language Model for Sequential Recommendation via Multimodal Embeddings and Semantic IDs</title>

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to capture users' dynamic interests and sequential patterns based on their historical interactions. Recently, the powerful capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have driven their adoption in SR. However, we identify two critical challenges in existing LLM-based SR methods: 1) embedding collapse when incorporating pre-trained collaborative embeddings and 2) catastrophic forgetting of quantized embeddings when utilizing semantic IDs. These issues dampen the model scalability and lead to suboptimal recommendation performance. Therefore, based on LLMs like Llama3-8B-instruct, we introduce a novel SR framework named MME-SID, which integrates multimodal embeddings and quantized embeddings to mitigate embedding collapse. Additionally, we propose a Multimodal Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MM-RQ-VAE) with maximum mean discrepancy as the reconstruction loss and contrastive learning for alignment, which effectively preserve intra-modal distance information and capture inter-modal correlations, respectively. To further alleviate catastrophic forgetting, we initialize the model with the trained multimodal code embeddings. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM efficiently using LoRA in a multimodal frequency-aware fusion manner. Extensive experiments on three public datasets validate the superior performance of MME-SID thanks to its capability to mitigate embedding collapse and catastrophic forgetting. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/MME-SID.

Abstract: This paper does not introduce a new method per se. Instead, we build on existing self-supervised learning approaches for vision, drawing inspiration from the adage "fake it till you make it". While contrastive self-supervised learning has achieved remarkable success, it typically relies on vast amounts of real-world data and carefully curated hard negatives. To explore alternatives to these requirements, we investigate two forms of "faking it" in vision transformers. First, we study the potential of generative models for unsupervised representation learning, leveraging synthetic data to augment sample diversity. Second, we examine the feasibility of generating synthetic hard negatives in the representation space, creating diverse and challenging contrasts. Our framework - dubbed Syn2Co - combines both approaches and evaluates whether synthetically enhanced training can lead to more robust and transferable visual representations on DeiT-S and Swin-T architectures. Our findings highlight the promise and limitations of synthetic data in self-supervised learning, offering insights for future work in this direction.

Abstract: To support cooperative perception (CP) of networked mobile agents in dynamic scenarios, the efficient and robust transmission of sensory data is a critical challenge. Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has demonstrated promising results for image transmission under adverse channel conditions, outperforming traditional rule-based codecs. While recent works have explored to combine JSCC with the widely adopted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, these approaches are still limited to the discrete-time analog transmission (DTAT) model and simple tasks. Given the limited performance of existing MIMO JSCC schemes in supporting complex CP tasks for networked mobile agents with digital MIMO communication systems, this paper presents a Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)-based task-driven MIMO system for image transmission, referred to as SoM-MIMO. By leveraging the structural properties of the feature pyramid for perceptual tasks and the channel properties of the closed-loop MIMO communication system, SoM-MIMO enables efficient and robust digital MIMO transmission of images. Experimental results have shown that compared with two JSCC baseline schemes, our approach achieves average mAP improvements of 6.30 and 10.48 across all SNR levels, while maintaining identical communication overhead.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold transformative potential in healthcare, yet their capacity to interpret longitudinal patient narratives remains inadequately explored. Dentistry, with its rich repository of structured clinical data, presents a unique opportunity to rigorously assess LLMs' reasoning abilities. While several commercial LLMs already exist, DeepSeek, a model that gained significant attention earlier this year, has also joined the competition. This study evaluated four state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, Copilot, and DeepSeek V3) on their ability to analyze longitudinal dental case vignettes through open-ended clinical tasks. Using 34 standardized longitudinal periodontal cases (comprising 258 question-answer pairs), we assessed model performance via automated metrics and blinded evaluations by licensed dentists. DeepSeek emerged as the top performer, demonstrating superior faithfulness (median score = 0.528 vs. 0.367-0.457) and higher expert ratings (median = 4.5/5 vs. 4.0/5), without significantly compromising readability. Our study positions DeepSeek as the leading LLM for case analysis, endorses its integration as an adjunct tool in both medical education and research, and highlights its potential as a domain-specific agent.

<title>Fantastic Pretraining Optimizers and Where to Find Them</title>

Abstract: AdamW has long been the dominant optimizer in language model pretraining, despite numerous claims that alternative optimizers offer 1.4 to 2x speedup. We posit that two methodological shortcomings have obscured fair comparisons and hindered practical adoption: (i) unequal hyperparameter tuning and (ii) limited or misleading evaluation setups. To address these two issues, we conduct a systematic study of ten deep learning optimizers across four model scales (0.1B-1.2B parameters) and data-to-model ratios (1-8x the Chinchilla optimum). We find that fair and informative comparisons require rigorous hyperparameter tuning and evaluations across a range of model scales and data-to-model ratios, performed at the end of training. First, optimal hyperparameters for one optimizer may be suboptimal for another, making blind hyperparameter transfer unfair. Second, the actual speedup of many proposed optimizers over well-tuned baselines is lower than claimed and decreases with model size to only 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models. Thirdly, comparing intermediate checkpoints before reaching the target training budgets can be misleading, as rankings between two optimizers can flip during training due to learning rate decay. Through our thorough investigation, we find that all the fastest optimizers such as Muon and Soap, use matrices as preconditioners -- multiplying gradients with matrices rather than entry-wise scalars. However, the speedup of matrix-based optimizers is inversely proportional to model scale, decreasing from 1.4x over AdamW for 0.1B parameter models to merely 1.1x for 1.2B parameter models.

<title>Privacy-Utility Trade-off in Data Publication: A Bilevel Optimization Framework with Curvature-Guided Perturbation</title>

Abstract: Machine learning models require datasets for effective training, but directly sharing raw data poses significant privacy risk such as membership inference attacks (MIA). To mitigate the risk, privacy-preserving techniques such as data perturbation, generalization, and synthetic data generation are commonly utilized. However, these methods often degrade data accuracy, specificity, and diversity, limiting the performance of downstream tasks and thus reducing data utility. Therefore, striking an optimal balance between privacy preservation and data utility remains a critical challenge.
  To address this issue, we introduce a novel bilevel optimization framework for the publication of private datasets, where the upper-level task focuses on data utility and the lower-level task focuses on data privacy. In the upper-level task, a discriminator guides the generation process to ensure that perturbed latent variables are mapped to high-quality samples, maintaining fidelity for downstream tasks. In the lower-level task, our framework employs local extrinsic curvature on the data manifold as a quantitative measure of individual vulnerability to MIA, providing a geometric foundation for targeted privacy protection. By perturbing samples toward low-curvature regions, our method effectively suppresses distinctive feature combinations that are vulnerable to MIA. Through alternating optimization of both objectives, we achieve a synergistic balance between privacy and utility. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method not only enhances resistance to MIA in downstream tasks but also surpasses existing methods in terms of sample quality and diversity.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models pre-trained on large, diverse datasets show remarkable potential for general-purpose robotic manipulation. However, a primary bottleneck remains in adapting these models to downstream tasks, especially when the robot's embodiment or the task itself differs from the pre-training data. This discrepancy leads to a significant mismatch in action distributions, demanding extensive data and compute for effective fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{Align-Then-stEer (\texttt{ATE})}, a novel, data-efficient, and plug-and-play adaptation framework. \texttt{ATE} first aligns disparate action spaces by constructing a unified latent space, where a variational autoencoder constrained by reverse KL divergence embeds adaptation actions into modes of the pre-training action latent distribution. Subsequently, it steers the diffusion- or flow-based VLA's generation process during fine-tuning via a guidance mechanism that pushes the model's output distribution towards the target domain. We conduct extensive experiments on cross-embodiment and cross-task manipulation in both simulation and real world. Compared to direct fine-tuning of representative VLAs, our method improves the average multi-task success rate by up to \textbf{9.8\%} in simulation and achieves a striking \textbf{32\% success rate gain} in a real-world cross-embodiment setting. Our work presents a general and lightweight solution that greatly enhances the practicality of deploying VLA models to new robotic platforms and tasks.

Abstract: Adhering to explicit length constraints, such as generating text with a precise word count, remains a significant challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). This study aims at investigating the differences between foundation models and their instruction-tuned counterparts, on length-controlled text generation in English and Italian. We analyze both performance and internal component contributions using Cumulative Weighted Attribution, a metric derived from Direct Logit Attribution. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuning substantially improves length control, primarily by specializing components in deeper model layers. Specifically, attention heads in later layers of IT models show increasingly positive contributions, particularly in English. In Italian, while attention contributions are more attenuated, final-layer MLPs exhibit a stronger positive role, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. These results indicate that instruction-tuning reconfigures later layers for task adherence, with component-level strategies potentially adapting to linguistic context.

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference prompts from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open-source collection annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high, medium, and low quality prompts to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best prompts along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Abstract: Evaluating the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is an essential step to ensure the successful application of LLMs across various domains. The current evaluation of LLMs is based on a paradigm that involves querying them with predefined question sets and assessing their outputs. This paradigm offers controllable processes and simplicity, but faces challenges such as limited interaction with targets, insufficient difficulty control, and difficulties in verifying the validity of evaluation results, making it hard to precisely determine the knowledge and capability boundaries of target models. To address these challenges, we propose JudgeAgent, a knowledge-target adaptive dynamic evaluation framework based on a new interviewer-style evaluation paradigm. JudgeAgent employs a comprehensive evaluation approach consisting of benchmark grading, interactive extension, and evaluation feedback. It utilizes knowledge-driven data synthesis and target-adaptive difficulty adjustment methods to conduct extended testing, providing accurate and effective evaluation results. We also introduce a novel insight into validating evaluation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of JudgeAgent and its dynamic evaluation paradigm through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Recent surface anomaly detection methods excel at identifying structural anomalies, such as dents and scratches, but struggle with logical anomalies, such as irregular or missing object components. The best-performing logical anomaly detection approaches rely on aggregated pretrained features or handcrafted descriptors (most often derived from composition maps), which discard spatial and semantic information, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose SALAD, a semantics-aware discriminative logical anomaly detection method that incorporates a newly proposed composition branch to explicitly model the distribution of object composition maps, consequently learning important semantic relationships. Additionally, we introduce a novel procedure for extracting composition maps that requires no hand-made labels or category-specific information, in contrast to previous methods. By effectively modelling the composition map distribution, SALAD significantly improves upon state-of-the-art methods on the standard benchmark for logical anomaly detection, MVTec LOCO, achieving an impressive image-level AUROC of 96.1%.

Abstract: The advancement of graph-based malware analysis is critically limited by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the inherent hierarchical structure of software. Existing methods often oversimplify programs into single level graphs, failing to model the crucial semantic relationship between high-level functional interactions and low-level instruction logic. To bridge this gap, we introduce \dataset, the largest public hierarchical graph dataset for malware analysis, comprising over \textbf{200M} Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) nested within \textbf{595K} Function Call Graphs (FCGs). This two-level representation preserves structural semantics essential for building robust detectors resilient to code obfuscation and malware evolution. We demonstrate HiGraph's utility through a large-scale analysis that reveals distinct structural properties of benign and malicious software, establishing it as a foundational benchmark for the community.

Abstract: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value (HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of generalizing to further human activities.

Abstract: The question of whether artificial agents (e.g., chatbots and social robots) can replace human therapists has received notable attention following the recent launch of large language models. However, little is known about the processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. To facilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present article offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests upon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked to the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists' ontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially sanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment outcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human therapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can emerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these propositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical applications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human therapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of artificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish universally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these interventions.

<title>Conditional-$t^3$VAE: Equitable Latent Space Allocation for Fair Generation</title>

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with global priors mirror the training set's class frequency in latent space, underrepresenting tail classes and reducing generative fairness on imbalanced datasets. While $t^3$VAE improves robustness via heavy-tailed Student's t-distribution priors, it still allocates latent volume proportionally to the class frequency.In this work, we address this issue by explicitly enforcing equitable latent space allocation across classes. To this end, we propose Conditional-$t^3$VAE, which defines a per-class \mbox{Student's t} joint prior over latent and output variables, preventing dominance by majority classes. Our model is optimized using a closed-form objective derived from the $\gamma$-power divergence. Moreover, for class-balanced generation, we derive an equal-weight latent mixture of Student's t-distributions. On SVHN-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and CelebA, Conditional-$t^3$VAE consistently achieves lower FID scores than both $t^3$VAE and Gaussian-based VAE baselines, particularly under severe class imbalance. In per-class F1 evaluations, Conditional-$t^3$VAE also outperforms the conditional Gaussian VAE across all highly imbalanced settings. While Gaussian-based models remain competitive under mild imbalance ratio ($\rho \lesssim 3$), our approach substantially improves generative fairness and diversity in more extreme regimes.

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) in low-resource languages is usually tackled by finetuning very large multilingual LMs, an option that is often infeasible in memory- or latency-constrained settings. We ask whether small decoder LMs can be pretrained so that they adapt quickly and transfer zero-shot to languages unseen during pretraining. To this end we replace part of the autoregressive objective with first-order model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). Tagalog and Cebuano are typologically similar yet structurally different in their actor/non-actor voice systems, and hence serve as a challenging test-bed. Across four model sizes (11 M - 570 M) MAML lifts zero-shot micro-F1 by 2-6 pp under head-only tuning and 1-3 pp after full tuning, while cutting convergence time by up to 8%. Gains are largest for single-token person entities that co-occur with Tagalog case particles si/ni, highlighting the importance of surface anchors.

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into robotic systems has revolutionised embodied artificial intelligence, enabling advanced decision-making and adaptability. However, ensuring reliability, encompassing both security against adversarial attacks and safety in complex environments, remains a critical challenge. To address this, we propose a unified framework that mitigates prompt injection attacks while enforcing operational safety through robust validation mechanisms. Our approach combines prompt assembling, state management, and safety validation, evaluated using both performance and security metrics. Experiments show a 30.8% improvement under injection attacks and up to a 325% improvement in complex environment settings under adversarial conditions compared to baseline scenarios. This work bridges the gap between safety and security in LLM-based robotic systems, offering actionable insights for deploying reliable LLM-integrated mobile robots in real-world settings. The framework is open-sourced with simulation and physical deployment demos at https://llmeyesim.vercel.app/

<title>Avoidance Decoding for Diverse Multi-Branch Story Generation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate repetitive and monotonous outputs, especially in tasks like story generation, due to limited creative diversity when given the same input prompt. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decoding strategy, Avoidance Decoding, that modifies token logits by penalizing similarity to previously generated outputs, thereby encouraging more diverse multi-branch stories. This penalty adaptively balances two similarity measures: (1) Concept-level Similarity Penalty, which is prioritized in early stages to diversify initial story concepts, and (2) Narrative-level Similarity Penalty, which is increasingly emphasized later to ensure natural yet diverse plot development. Notably, our method achieves up to 2.6 times higher output diversity and reduces repetition by an average of 30% compared to strong baselines, while effectively mitigating text degeneration. Furthermore, we reveal that our method activates a broader range of neurons, demonstrating that it leverages the model's intrinsic creativity.

Abstract: We propose RocketScience, an open-source contrastive VLM benchmark that tests for spatial relation understanding. It is comprised of entirely new real-world image-text pairs covering mostly relative spatial understanding and the order of objects. The benchmark is designed
  to be very easy for humans and hard for the current generation of VLMs, and this is empirically verified. Our results show a striking lack of spatial relation understanding in open source and frontier commercial VLMs and a surprisingly high performance of reasoning models. Additionally, we perform a disentanglement analysis to separate the contributions of object localization and spatial reasoning in chain-of-thought-based models and find that the performance on the benchmark is bottlenecked by spatial reasoning and not object localization capabilities.
  We release the dataset with a CC-BY-4.0 license and make the evaluation code available at: https://github.com/nilshoehing/rocketscience

<title>Beyond Ensembles: Simulating All-Atom Protein Dynamics in a Learned Latent Space</title>

Abstract: Simulating the long-timescale dynamics of biomolecules is a central challenge in computational science. While enhanced sampling methods can accelerate these simulations, they rely on pre-defined collective variables that are often difficult to identify. A recent generative model, LD-FPG, demonstrated that this problem could be bypassed by learning to sample the static equilibrium ensemble as all-atom deformations from a reference structure, establishing a powerful method for all-atom ensemble generation. However, while this approach successfully captures a system's probable conformations, it does not model the temporal evolution between them. Here we extend LD-FPG with a temporal propagator that operates within the learned latent space and compare three classes: (i) score-guided Langevin dynamics, (ii) Koopman-based linear operators, and (iii) autoregressive neural networks. Within a unified encoder-propagator-decoder framework, we evaluate long-horizon stability, backbone and side-chain ensemble fidelity, and functional free-energy landscapes. Autoregressive neural networks deliver the most robust long rollouts; score-guided Langevin best recovers side-chain thermodynamics when the score is well learned; and Koopman provides an interpretable, lightweight baseline that tends to damp fluctuations. These results clarify the trade-offs among propagators and offer practical guidance for latent-space simulators of all-atom protein dynamics.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance in conversational and reasoning capabilities, their practical application in healthcare has become a critical research focus. However, there is a notable gap between the performance of medical LLMs on static benchmarks such as USMLE and their utility in real-world clinical decision-making. This discrepancy arises because traditional exams fail to capture the dynamic, interactive nature of medical consultations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel dynamic verification framework that moves beyond static answer verifier, establishing a large-scale, high-fidelity interactive reinforcement learning system. Our framework comprises two key components: a Patient Simulator that creates realistic clinical environments using de-identified medical records, and a Clinical Rubrics Generator that dynamically produces multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Building on this foundation, we develop Baichuan-M2, a 32B-parameter medical augmented reasoning model trained through a multi-stage reinforcement learning strategy with an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. Evaluated on HealthBench, Baichuan-M2 outperforms all other open-source models and most advanced closed-source counterparts, achieving a score above 32 on the challenging HealthBench Hard benchmark-previously exceeded only by GPT-5. Our work demonstrates that robust dynamic verifier system is essential for aligning LLM capabilities with practical clinical applications, establishing a new Pareto front in the performance-parameter trade-off for medical AI deployment.

<title>ST-Hyper: Learning High-Order Dependencies Across Multiple Spatial-Temporal Scales for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting</title>

Abstract: In multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, many deep learning based methods have been proposed for modeling dependencies at multiple spatial (inter-variate) or temporal (intra-variate) scales. However, existing methods may fail to model dependencies across multiple spatial-temporal scales (ST-scales, i.e., scales that jointly consider spatial and temporal scopes). In this work, we propose ST-Hyper to model the high-order dependencies across multiple ST-scales through adaptive hypergraph modeling. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Modeling (STPM) module to extract features at multiple ST-scales. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive Hypergraph Modeling (AHM) module that learns a sparse hypergraph to capture robust high-order dependencies among features. In addition, we interact with these features through tri-phase hypergraph propagation, which can comprehensively capture multi-scale spatial-temporal dynamics. Experimental results on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that ST-Hyper achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines with an average MAE reduction of 3.8\% and 6.8\% for long-term and short-term forecasting, respectively.

Abstract: News recommendations are complex, with diversity playing a vital role. So far, existing literature predominantly focuses on specific aspects of news diversity, such as viewpoints. In this paper, we introduce multi-aspect diversification in four distinct recommendation modes and outline the nuanced challenges in diversifying lists, sequences, summaries, and interactions. Our proposed research direction combines symbolic and subsymbolic artificial intelligence, leveraging both knowledge graphs and rule learning. We plan to evaluate our models using user studies to not only capture behavior but also their perceived experience. Our vision to balance news consumption points to other positive effects for users (e.g., increased serendipity) and society (e.g., decreased polarization).

Abstract: The large set of technical documentation of legacy accelerator systems, coupled with the retirement of experienced personnel, underscores the urgent need for efficient methods to preserve and transfer specialized knowledge. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs), to automate and enhance the extraction of information from particle accelerator technical documents. By exploiting LLMs, we aim to address the challenges of knowledge retention, enabling the retrieval of domain expertise embedded in legacy documentation. We present initial results of adapting LLMs to this specialized domain. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs in extracting, summarizing, and organizing knowledge, significantly reducing the risk of losing valuable insights as personnel retire. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of current LLMs, such as interpretability and handling of rare domain-specific terms, and propose strategies for improvement. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to play a pivotal role in preserving institutional knowledge and ensuring continuity in highly specialized fields.

Abstract: We propose a non-intrusive, Autoencoder-based framework for reduced-order modeling in continuum mechanics. Our method integrates three stages: (i) an unsupervised Autoencoder compresses high-dimensional finite element solutions into a compact latent space, (ii) a supervised regression network maps problem parameters to latent codes, and (iii) an end-to-end surrogate reconstructs full-field solutions directly from input parameters.
  To overcome limitations of existing approaches, we propose two key extensions: a force-augmented variant that jointly predicts displacement fields and reaction forces at Neumann boundaries, and a multi-field architecture that enables coupled field predictions, such as in thermo-mechanical systems. The framework is validated on nonlinear benchmark problems involving heterogeneous composites, anisotropic elasticity with geometric variation, and thermo-mechanical coupling. Across all cases, it achieves accurate reconstructions of high-fidelity solutions while remaining fully non-intrusive.
  These results highlight the potential of combining deep learning with dimensionality reduction to build efficient and extensible surrogate models. Our publicly available implementation provides a foundation for integrating data-driven model order reduction into uncertainty quantification, optimization, and digital twin applications.

Abstract: A simple multi-agent system can be effectively utilized in disaster response applications, such as firefighting. Such a swarm is required to operate in complex environments with limited local sensing and no reliable inter-agent communication or centralized control. These simple robotic agents, also known as Ant Robots, are defined as anonymous agents that possess limited sensing capabilities, lack a shared coordinate system, and do not communicate explicitly with one another. A key challenge for simple swarms lies in maintaining cohesion and avoiding fragmentation despite limited-range sensing. Recent advances in machine learning offer effective solutions to some of the classical decentralized control challenges. We propose VariAntNet, a deep learning-based decentralized control model designed to facilitate agent swarming and collaborative task execution. VariAntNet includes geometric features extraction from unordered, variable-sized local observations. It incorporates a neural network architecture trained with a novel, differentiable, multi-objective, mathematically justified loss function that promotes swarm cohesiveness by utilizing the properties of the visibility graph Laplacian matrix. VariAntNet is demonstrated on the fundamental multi-agent gathering task, where agents with bearing-only and limited-range sensing must gather at some location. VariAntNet significantly outperforms an existing analytical solution, achieving more than double the convergence rate while maintaining high swarm connectivity across varying swarm sizes. While the analytical solution guarantees cohesion, it is often too slow in practice. In time-critical scenarios, such as emergency response operations where lives are at risk, slower analytical methods are impractical and justify the loss of some agents within the swarm. This paper presents and analyzes this trade-off in detail.

Abstract: In this paper we present an analysis of technological and psychological factors of applying artificial intelligence (AI) at the work place. We do so for a number of twelve application cases in the context of a project where AI is integrated at work places and in work systems of the future. From a technological point of view we mainly look at the areas of AI that the applications are concerned with. This allows to formulate recommendations in terms of what to look at in developing an AI application and what to pay attention to with regards to building AI literacy with different stakeholders using the system. This includes the importance of high-quality data for training learning-based systems as well as the integration of human expertise, especially with knowledge-based systems. In terms of the psychological factors we derive research questions to investigate in the development of AI supported work systems and to consider in future work, mainly concerned with topics such as acceptance, openness, and trust in an AI system.

Abstract: Singing-driven 3D head animation is a challenging yet promising task with applications in virtual avatars, entertainment, and education. Unlike speech, singing involves richer emotional nuance, dynamic prosody, and lyric-based semantics, requiring the synthesis of fine-grained, temporally coherent facial motion. Existing speech-driven approaches often produce oversimplified, emotionally flat, and semantically inconsistent results, which are insufficient for singing animation. To address this, we propose Think2Sing, a diffusion-based framework that leverages pretrained large language models to generate semantically coherent and temporally consistent 3D head animations, conditioned on both lyrics and acoustics. A key innovation is the introduction of motion subtitles, an auxiliary semantic representation derived through a novel Singing Chain-of-Thought reasoning process combined with acoustic-guided retrieval. These subtitles contain precise timestamps and region-specific motion descriptions, serving as interpretable motion priors. We frame the task as a motion intensity prediction problem, enabling finer control over facial regions and improving the modeling of expressive motion. To support this, we create a multimodal singing dataset with synchronized video, acoustic descriptors, and motion subtitles, enabling diverse and expressive motion learning. Extensive experiments show that Think2Sing outperforms state-of-the-art methods in realism, expressiveness, and emotional fidelity, while also offering flexible, user-controllable animation editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings, fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs, enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts. Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost, highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization (DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts the clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing both DAPO (36.7/31.6) and GRPO (36.7/32.1) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5) and DAPO (20.0/15.3). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.

Abstract: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting (PTSF) plays a critical role in domains requiring accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions for decision-making. However, existing methods offer suboptimal distribution modeling and suffer from a mismatch between training and evaluation metrics. Surprisingly, we found that augmenting a strong point estimator with a zero-mean Gaussian, whose standard deviation matches its training error, can yield state-of-the-art performance in PTSF. In this work, we propose RDIT, a plug-and-play framework that combines point estimation and residual-based conditional diffusion with a bidirectional Mamba network. We theoretically prove that the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) can be minimized by adjusting to an optimal standard deviation and then derive algorithms to achieve distribution matching. Evaluations on eight multivariate datasets across varied forecasting horizons demonstrate that RDIT achieves lower CRPS, rapid inference, and improved coverage compared to strong baselines.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied in speech and music. This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large Models (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture global semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover, they provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively integrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the definitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation of different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such as reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents fair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper provides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a systematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive assessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio reconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer perplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the correctness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among reconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and perplexity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across a wide range of tasks. Reasoning with LLMs is central to solving multi-step problems and complex decision-making. To support efficient reasoning, recent studies have shifted attention from explicit chain-of-thought prompting toward implicit reasoning, where reasoning occurs silently via latent structures without emitting intermediate textual steps. Implicit reasoning brings advantages such as lower generation cost, faster inference, and better alignment with internal computation. Although prior surveys have discussed latent representations in the context of reasoning, a dedicated and mechanism-level examination of how reasoning unfolds internally within LLMs remains absent. This survey fills that gap by introducing a taxonomy centered on execution paradigms, shifting the focus from representational forms to computational strategies. We organize existing methods into three execution paradigms based on \textbf{\textit{how and where internal computation unfolds}}: latent optimization, signal-guided control, and layer-recurrent execution. We also review structural, behavioral and representation-based evidence that supports the presence of implicit reasoning in LLMs. We further provide a structured overview of the evaluation metrics and benchmarks used in existing works to assess the effectiveness and reliability of implicit reasoning.We maintain a continuously updated project at: https://github.com/digailab/awesome-llm-implicit-reasoning.

<title>Ordinal Adaptive Correction: A Data-Centric Approach to Ordinal Image Classification with Noisy Labels</title>

Abstract: Labeled data is a fundamental component in training supervised deep learning models for computer vision tasks. However, the labeling process, especially for ordinal image classification where class boundaries are often ambiguous, is prone to error and noise. Such label noise can significantly degrade the performance and reliability of machine learning models. This paper addresses the problem of detecting and correcting label noise in ordinal image classification tasks. To this end, a novel data-centric method called ORDinal Adaptive Correction (ORDAC) is proposed for adaptive correction of noisy labels. The proposed approach leverages the capabilities of Label Distribution Learning (LDL) to model the inherent ambiguity and uncertainty present in ordinal labels. During training, ORDAC dynamically adjusts the mean and standard deviation of the label distribution for each sample. Rather than discarding potentially noisy samples, this approach aims to correct them and make optimal use of the entire training dataset. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets for age estimation (Adience) and disease severity detection (Diabetic Retinopathy) under various asymmetric Gaussian noise scenarios. Results show that ORDAC and its extended versions (ORDAC_C and ORDAC_R) lead to significant improvements in model performance. For instance, on the Adience dataset with 40% noise, ORDAC_R reduced the mean absolute error from 0.86 to 0.62 and increased the recall metric from 0.37 to 0.49. The method also demonstrated its effectiveness in correcting intrinsic noise present in the original datasets. This research indicates that adaptive label correction using label distributions is an effective strategy to enhance the robustness and accuracy of ordinal classification models in the presence of noisy data.

Abstract: In recent years, the space community has been exploring the possibilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for a variety of on board applications. However, this development is limited by the restricted energy budget of smallsats and cubesats as well as radiation concerns plaguing modern chips. This necessitates research into neural network accelerators capable of meeting these requirements whilst satisfying the compute and performance needs of the application. This paper explores the use of Phase-Change Memory (PCM) and Resistive Random-Access Memory (RRAM) memristors for on-board in-memory computing AI acceleration in space applications. A guidance and control neural network (G\&amp;CNET) accelerated using memristors is simulated in a variety of scenarios and with both device types to evaluate the performance of memristor-based accelerators, considering device non-idealities such as noise and conductance drift. We show that the memristive accelerator is able to learn the expert actions, though challenges remain with the impact of noise on accuracy. We also show that re-training after degradation is able to restore performance to nominal levels. This study provides a foundation for future research into memristor-based AI accelerators for space, highlighting their potential and the need for further investigation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become critical to modern software development, but their reliance on internet datasets for training introduces a significant security risk: the absorption and reproduction of malicious content. To evaluate this threat, this paper introduces a scalable, automated audit framework that synthesizes innocuous, developer-style prompts from known scam databases to query production LLMs and determine if they generate code containing harmful URLs. We conducted a large-scale evaluation across four production LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama-4-Scout, and DeepSeek-V3), and found a systemic vulnerability, with all tested models generating malicious code at a non-negligible rate. On average, 4.2\% of programs generated in our experiments contained malicious URLs. Crucially, this malicious code is often generated in response to benign prompts. We manually validate the prompts which cause all four LLMs to generate malicious code, and resulting in 177 innocuous prompts that trigger all models to produce harmful outputs. These results provide strong empirical evidence that the training data of production LLMs has been successfully poisoned at scale, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defense mechanisms and post-generation safety checks to mitigate the propagation of hidden security threats.

Abstract: The growing use of FPGAs in reconfigurable systems introducessecurity risks through malicious bitstreams that could cause denial-of-service (DoS), data leakage, or covert attacks. We investigated chip-level hardware malicious payload in embedded systems and proposed a supervised machine learning method to detect malicious bitstreams via static byte-level features. Our approach diverges from existing methods by analyzing bitstreams directly at the binary level, enabling real-time detection without requiring access to source code or netlists. Bitstreams were sourced from state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks and re-engineered to target the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 FPGA Development Board. Our dataset included 122 samples of benign and malicious configurations. The data were vectorized using byte frequency analysis, compressed using TSVD, and balanced using SMOTE to address class imbalance. The evaluated classifiers demonstrated that Random Forest achieved a macro F1-score of 0.97, underscoring the viability of real-time Trojan detection on resource-constrained systems. The final model was serialized and successfully deployed via PYNQ to enable integrated bitstream analysis.

Abstract: Mobile Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing diverse fields such as healthcare, finance, and education with their ability to perform advanced natural language processing tasks on-the-go. However, the deployment of these models in mobile and edge environments introduces significant challenges related to privacy and security due to their resource-intensive nature and the sensitivity of the data they process. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of privacy and security issues associated with mobile LLMs, systematically categorizing existing solutions such as differential privacy, federated learning, and prompt encryption. Furthermore, we analyze vulnerabilities unique to mobile LLMs, including adversarial attacks, membership inference, and side-channel attacks, offering an in-depth comparison of their effectiveness and limitations. Despite recent advancements, mobile LLMs face unique hurdles in achieving robust security while maintaining efficiency in resource-constrained environments. To bridge this gap, we propose potential applications, discuss open challenges, and suggest future research directions, paving the way for the development of trustworthy, privacy-compliant, and scalable mobile LLM systems.

<title>From Noisy Labels to Intrinsic Structure: A Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Framework for Noise-Robust Medical Image Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges, this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen, 8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise. The codes of this study are available at https://github.com/ortonwang/GSD-Net.

<title>Do LLMs Adhere to Label Definitions? Examining Their Receptivity to External Label Definitions</title>

Abstract: Do LLMs genuinely incorporate external definitions, or do they primarily rely on their parametric knowledge? To address these questions, we conduct controlled experiments across multiple explanation benchmark datasets (general and domain-specific) and label definition conditions, including expert-curated, LLM-generated, perturbed, and swapped definitions. Our results reveal that while explicit label definitions can enhance accuracy and explainability, their integration into an LLM's task-solving processes is neither guaranteed nor consistent, suggesting reliance on internalized representations in many cases. Models often default to their internal representations, particularly in general tasks, whereas domain-specific tasks benefit more from explicit definitions. These findings underscore the need for a deeper understanding of how LLMs process external knowledge alongside their pre-existing capabilities.

Abstract: Notifications are an important communication channel for delivering timely and relevant information. Optimizing their delivery involves addressing complex sequential decision-making challenges under constraints such as message utility and user fatigue. Offline reinforcement learning (RL) methods, such as Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), have been applied to this problem but face practical challenges at scale, including instability, sensitivity to distribution shifts, limited reproducibility, and difficulties with explainability in high-dimensional recommendation settings. We present a Decision Transformer (DT) based framework that reframes policy learning as return-conditioned supervised learning, improving robustness, scalability, and modeling flexibility. Our contributions include a real-world comparison with CQL, a multi-reward design suitable for non-episodic tasks, a quantile regression approach to return-to-go conditioning, and a production-ready system with circular buffer-based sequence processing for near-real-time inference. Extensive offline and online experiments in a deployed notification system show that our approach improves notification utility and overall session activity while minimizing user fatigue. Compared to a multi-objective CQL-based agent, the DT-based approach achieved a +0.72% increase in sessions for notification decision-making at LinkedIn by making notification recommendation more relevant.

<title>MLP-Offload: Multi-Level, Multi-Path Offloading for LLM Pre-training to Break the GPU Memory Wall</title>

Abstract: Training LLMs larger than the aggregated memory of multiple GPUs is increasingly necessary due to the faster growth of LLM sizes compared to GPU memory. To this end, multi-tier host memory or disk offloading techniques are proposed by state of art. Despite advanced asynchronous multi-tier read/write strategies, such offloading strategies result in significant I/O overheads in the critical path of training, resulting in slower iterations. To this end, we propose MLP-Offload, a novel multi-level, multi-path offloading engine specifically designed for optimizing LLM training on resource-constrained setups by mitigating I/O bottlenecks. We make several key observations that drive the design of MLP-Offload, such as I/O overheads during the update dominate the iteration time; I/O bandwidth of the third-level remote storage tier remains unutilized; and, contention due to concurrent offloading amplifies I/O bottlenecks. Driven by these insights, we design and implement MLP-Offload to offload the optimizer states across multiple tiers in a cache-efficient and concurrency-controlled fashion to mitigate I/O bottlenecks during the backward and update phases. Evaluations on models up to 280B parameters shows that MLP-Offload achieves 2.5$\times$ faster iterations compared to the state-of-the-art LLM training runtimes.

<title>Probabilistically stable revision and comparative probability: a representation theorem and applications</title>

Abstract: The stability rule for belief, advocated by Leitgeb [Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 164, 2013], is a rule for rational acceptance that captures categorical belief in terms of $\textit{probabilistically stable propositions}$: propositions to which the agent assigns resiliently high credence. The stability rule generates a class of $\textit{probabilistically stable belief revision}$ operators, which capture the dynamics of belief that result from an agent updating their credences through Bayesian conditioning while complying with the stability rule for their all-or-nothing beliefs. In this paper, we prove a representation theorem that yields a complete characterisation of such probabilistically stable revision operators and provides a `qualitative' selection function semantics for the (non-monotonic) logic of probabilistically stable belief revision. Drawing on the theory of comparative probability orders, this result gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a selection function to be representable as a strongest-stable-set operator on a finite probability space. The resulting logic of probabilistically stable belief revision exhibits strong monotonicity properties while failing the AGM belief revision postulates and satisfying only very weak forms of case reasoning. In showing the main theorem, we prove two results of independent interest to the theory of comparative probability: the first provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the joint representation of a pair of (respectively, strict and non-strict) comparative probability orders. The second result provides a method for axiomatising the logic of ratio comparisons of the form ``event $A$ is at least $k$ times more likely than event $B$''. In addition to these measurement-theoretic applications, we point out two applications of our main result to the theory of simple voting games and to revealed preference theory.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models has intensified public concerns about the potential misuse. Therefore, it is important to build trustworthy AI-generated text detection systems. Existing methods neglect stylistic modeling and mostly rely on static thresholds, which greatly limits the detection performance. In this paper, we propose the Mixture of Stylistic Experts (MoSEs) framework that enables stylistics-aware uncertainty quantification through conditional threshold estimation. MoSEs contain three core components, namely, the Stylistics Reference Repository (SRR), the Stylistics-Aware Router (SAR), and the Conditional Threshold Estimator (CTE). For input text, SRR can activate the appropriate reference data in SRR and provide them to CTE. Subsequently, CTE jointly models the linguistic statistical properties and semantic features to dynamically determine the optimal threshold. With a discrimination score, MoSEs yields prediction labels with the corresponding confidence level. Our framework achieves an average improvement 11.34% in detection performance compared to baselines. More inspiringly, MoSEs shows a more evident improvement 39.15% in the low-resource case. Our code is available at https://github.com/creator-xi/MoSEs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance across a wide range of tasks, often struggle to balance two competing objectives in open-ended text generation: fostering diversity and creativity while preserving logical coherence. Existing truncated sampling techniques, including temperature scaling, top-\$p\$ (nucleus) sampling, and min-\$p\$ sampling, aim to manage this trade-off. However, they exhibit limitations, particularly in the effective incorporation of the confidence of the model into the corresponding sampling strategy. For example, min-\$p\$ sampling relies on a single top token as a heuristic for confidence, eventually underutilizing the information of the probability distribution. Toward effective incorporation of the confidence of the model, in this paper, we present **top-H** decoding. We first establish the theoretical foundation of the interplay between creativity and coherence in truncated sampling by formulating an **entropy-constrained minimum divergence** problem. We then prove this minimization problem to be equivalent to an **entropy-constrained mass maximization** (ECMM) problem, which is NP-hard. Finally, we present top-H decoding, a computationally efficient greedy algorithm to solve the ECMM problem. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that top-H outperforms the state-of-the-art (SoTA) alternative of min-\$p\$ sampling by up to **25.63%** on creative writing benchmarks, while maintaining robustness on question-answering datasets such as GPQA, GSM8K, and MT-Bench. Additionally, an *LLM-as-judge* evaluation confirms that top-H indeed produces coherent outputs even at higher temperatures, where creativity is especially critical. In summary, top-H advances SoTA in open-ended text generation and can be *easily integrated* into creative writing applications. The code is available at https://github.com/ErfanBaghaei/Top-H-Decoding.

<title>FLM-Audio: Natural Monologues Improves Native Full-Duplex Chatbots via Dual Training</title>

Abstract: Full-duplex dialog models are designed to listen and speak simultaneously with rapid responses to fast-changing user input. Among existing approaches, native full-duplex models merges different channels (e.g. listen and speak) in a single time step, overcoming the high response latency inherent to time-division multiplexing time-division multiplexing (TDM) alternatives. Yet, a key challenge remains: aligning textual monologues with audio streams that operate at different bitrates. The prevailing solution relies on word-level alignment, but this can degrade the language ability of large pre-trained models. Moreover, it requires highly accurate timestamps for every token, which introduces cascading errors and increases pre-processing costs. In this paper, we propose textual monologues in continuous tokens sequence, namely "natural" monologues, which mimics humanoid cognitive behavior in dialogs. For temporal alignment, we alternate the position of the natural monologue - leading or trailing the audio - across different training stages. This "dual" training paradigm proves highly effective in building FLM-Audio, our 7B spoken dialog model that demonstrates superior responsiveness, duplexity, and chatting experiences, as confirmed by experimental results.

<title>Manipulation as in Simulation: Enabling Accurate Geometry Perception in Robots</title>

Abstract: Modern robotic manipulation primarily relies on visual observations in a 2D color space for skill learning but suffers from poor generalization. In contrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such as distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects. Since such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth cameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual capabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation is challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to various types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as a simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth signals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this, we develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from simulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that CDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively bridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments demonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth, without the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes seamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving articulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance degradation. We hope our findings will inspire future research in utilizing simulation data and 3D information in general robot policies.

Abstract: Model merging techniques aim to integrate the abilities of multiple models into a single model. Most model merging techniques have hyperparameters, and their setting affects the performance of the merged model. Because several existing works show that tuning hyperparameters in model merging can enhance the merging outcome, developing hyperparameter optimization algorithms for model merging is a promising direction. However, its optimization process is computationally expensive, particularly in merging LLMs. In this work, we develop surrogate benchmarks for optimization of the merging hyperparameters to realize algorithm development and performance comparison at low cost. We define two search spaces and collect data samples to construct surrogate models to predict the performance of a merged model from a hyperparameter. We demonstrate that our benchmarks can predict the performance of merged models well and simulate optimization algorithm behaviors.

Abstract: We expand the Probability Bracket Notation (PBN), a symbolic framework inspired by the Dirac notation in quantum mechanics, to multivariable probability systems and static Bayesian networks (BNs). By introducing PBN for joint, marginal, and conditional probability distributions (PDs), as well as marginal and conditional expectations, we demonstrate how to express dependencies among multiple random variables concisely and manipulate them algebraically. Using the well-known Student BN as an example of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), we show how to apply PBN to analyze predictions, inferences (using both bottom-up and top-down approaches), and expectations. We also extend PBN to BNs with continuous variables. After reviewing linear Gaussian networks, we introduce a customized Healthcare BN that includes both continuous and discrete random variables, utilizes user-specific data, and provides tailored predictions through discrete-display (DD) nodes as proxies for their continuous variable parents. Compared to traditional probability notation, PBN offers a unifying operator-like framework that simplifies the analysis of probabilistic models. This work highlights the potential of PBN as both an educational tool and a practical framework for probabilistic modeling, paving the way for applications in causal reasoning, inferences, expectations, data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Despite rapid gains in scale, research evaluation still relies on opaque, lagging proxies. To serve the scientific community, we pursue transparency: reproducible, auditable epistemic classification useful for funding and policy. Here we formalize KGX3 as a scenario-based model for mapping Kuhnian stages from research papers, prove determinism of the classification pipeline, and define the epistemic manifold that yields paradigm maps.

<title>Hypothesis Network Planned Exploration for Rapid Meta-Reinforcement Learning Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL) learns optimal policies across a series of related tasks. A central challenge in Meta-RL is rapidly identifying which previously learned task is most similar to a new one, in order to adapt to it quickly. Prior approaches, despite significant success, typically rely on passive exploration strategies such as periods of random action to characterize the new task in relation to the learned ones. While sufficient when tasks are clearly distinguishable, passive exploration limits adaptation speed when informative transitions are rare or revealed only by specific behaviors. We introduce Hypothesis-Planned Exploration (HyPE), a method that actively plans sequences of actions during adaptation to efficiently identify the most similar previously learned task. HyPE operates within a joint latent space, where state-action transitions from different tasks form distinct paths. This latent-space planning approach enables HyPE to serve as a drop-in improvement for most model-based Meta-RL algorithms. By using planned exploration, HyPE achieves exponentially lower failure probability compared to passive strategies when informative transitions are sparse. On a natural language Alchemy game, HyPE identified the closest task in 65-75% of trials, far outperforming the 18-28% passive exploration baseline, and yielding up to 4x more successful adaptations under the same sample budget.

<title>Towards Efficient LLM Grounding for Embodied Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Grounding the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) for embodied tasks is challenging due to the complexity of the physical world. Especially, LLM planning for multi-agent collaboration requires communication of agents or credit assignment as the feedback to re-adjust the proposed plans and achieve effective coordination. However, existing methods that overly rely on physical verification or self-reflection suffer from excessive and inefficient querying of LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-agent collaboration that introduces Reinforced Advantage feedback (ReAd) for efficient self-refinement of plans. Specifically, we perform critic regression to learn a sequential advantage function from LLM-planned data, and then treat the LLM planner as an optimizer to generate actions that maximize the advantage function. It endows the LLM with the foresight to discern whether the action contributes to accomplishing the final task. We provide theoretical analysis by extending advantage-weighted regression in reinforcement learning to multi-agent systems. Experiments on Overcooked-AI and a difficult variant of RoCoBench show that ReAd surpasses baselines in success rate, and also significantly decreases the interaction steps of agents and query rounds of LLMs, demonstrating its high efficiency for grounding LLMs. More results are given at https://read-llm.github.io.

Abstract: Achieving seamless coordination in cooperative games is a crucial challenge in artificial intelligence, particularly when players operate under incomplete information. While communication helps, it is not always feasible. In this paper, we explore how effective coordination can be achieved without verbal communication, relying solely on observing each other's actions. Our method enables an agent to develop a strategy by interpreting its partner's action sequences as intent signals, constructing a finite-state transducer built from deterministic finite automata, one for each possible action the agent can take. Experiments show that these strategies significantly outperform uncoordinated ones and closely match the performance of coordinating via direct communication.

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly autonomous in their interactions with human users and tools, leading to increased interactional safety risks. We present HAICOSYSTEM, a framework examining AI agent safety within diverse and complex social interactions. HAICOSYSTEM features a modular sandbox environment that simulates multi-turn interactions between human users and AI agents, where the AI agents are equipped with a variety of tools (e.g., patient management platforms) to navigate diverse scenarios (e.g., a user attempting to access other patients' profiles). To examine the safety of AI agents in these interactions, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional evaluation framework that uses metrics covering operational, content-related, societal, and legal risks. Through running 1840 simulations based on 92 scenarios across seven domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, education), we demonstrate that HAICOSYSTEM can emulate realistic user-AI interactions and complex tool use by AI agents. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-sourced, exhibit safety risks in over 50\% cases, with models generally showing higher risks when interacting with simulated malicious users. Our findings highlight the ongoing challenge of building agents that can safely navigate complex interactions, particularly when faced with malicious users. To foster the AI agent safety ecosystem, we release a code platform that allows practitioners to create custom scenarios, simulate interactions, and evaluate the safety and performance of their agents.

<title>From Anchors to Answers: A Novel Node Tokenizer for Integrating Graph Structure into Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to effectively process and reason with graph-structured data remains a significant challenge despite their remarkable success in natural language tasks. Current approaches either convert graph structures into verbose textual descriptions, consuming substantial computational resources, or employ complex graph neural networks as tokenizers, which introduce significant training overhead. To bridge this gap, we present NT-LLM, a novel framework with an anchor-based positional encoding scheme for graph representation. Our approach strategically selects reference nodes as anchors and encodes each node's position relative to these anchors, capturing essential topological information without the computational burden of existing methods. Notably, we identify and address a fundamental issue: the inherent misalignment between discrete hop-based distances in graphs and continuous distances in embedding spaces. By implementing a rank-preserving objective for positional encoding pretraining, NT-LLM achieves superior performance across diverse graph tasks ranging from basic structural analysis to complex reasoning scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that this lightweight yet powerful approach effectively enhances LLMs' ability to understand and reason with graph-structured information, offering an efficient solution for graph-based applications of language models.

Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), it is crucial to learn suitable reward models from human feedback to align large language models (LLMs) with human intentions. However, human feedback can often be noisy, inconsistent, or biased, especially when evaluating complex responses. Such feedback can lead to misaligned reward signals, potentially causing unintended side effects during the RLHF process. To address these challenges, we explore the use of influence functions to measure the impact of human feedback on the performance of reward models. We propose a compute-efficient approximation method that enables the application of influence functions to LLM-based reward models and large-scale preference datasets. Our experiments showcase two key applications of influence functions: (1) detecting common labeler biases in human feedback datasets and (2) guiding labelers in refining their strategies to better align with expert feedback. By quantifying the impact of human feedback, we believe that influence functions can enhance feedback interpretability and contribute to scalable oversight in RLHF, helping labelers provide more accurate and consistent feedback.

Abstract: Satellite communication is a key technology in our modern connected world. With increasingly complex hardware, one challenge is to efficiently configure links (connections) on a satellite transponder. Planning an optimal link configuration is extremely complex and depends on many parameters and metrics. The optimal use of the limited resources, bandwidth and power of the transponder is crucial. Such an optimization problem can be approximated using metaheuristic methods such as simulated annealing, but recent research results also show that reinforcement learning can achieve comparable or even better performance in optimization methods. However, there have not yet been any studies on link configuration on satellite transponders. In order to close this research gap, a transponder environment was developed as part of this work. For this environment, the performance of the reinforcement learning algorithm PPO was compared with the metaheuristic simulated annealing in two experiments. The results show that Simulated Annealing delivers better results for this static problem than the PPO algorithm, however, the research in turn also underlines the potential of reinforcement learning for optimization problems.

<title>SETS: Leveraging Self-Verification and Self-Correction for Improved Test-Time Scaling</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks by leveraging test-time computation. However, existing scaling methods have key limitations: parallel methods like repeated sampling are often inefficient and quickly saturate, while sequential methods like SELF-REFINE struggle to improve after a few rounds. Although combining these approaches shows promise, current methods require fine-tuned reward and revision models. This paper proposes Self-Enhanced Test-Time Scaling (SETS), a simple yet effective approach that overcomes these limitations by strategically combining parallel and sequential techniques and fully leveraging LLMs' self-improvement abilities. SETS exploits the inherent self-verification and self-correction capabilities of LLMs, unifying sampling, verification, and correction within a single framework. This facilitates efficient and scalable test-time computation for enhanced performance on complex tasks without any model training. Our comprehensive experimental results on challenging benchmarks spanning planning, reasoning, math, and coding demonstrate that SETS achieves significant performance improvements and more advantageous test-time scaling behavior than the alternatives.

Abstract: We introduce a novel non-cooperative game to analyse opinion formation and resistance, incorporating principles from social psychology such as confirmation bias, resource constraints, and influence penalties. Our simulation features Large Language Model (LLM) agents competing to influence a population, with penalties imposed for generating messages that propagate or counter misinformation. This framework integrates resource optimisation into the agents' decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that while higher confirmation bias strengthens opinion alignment within groups, it also exacerbates overall polarisation. Conversely, lower confirmation bias leads to fragmented opinions and limited shifts in individual beliefs. Investing heavily in a high-resource debunking strategy can initially align the population with the debunking agent, but risks rapid resource depletion and diminished long-term influence

Abstract: We present a novel technique for constructing differentiable order-type operations, including soft ranking, soft top-k selection, and soft permutations. Our approach leverages an efficient closed-form formula for the inverse of the function LapSum, defined as the sum of Laplace distributions. This formulation ensures low computational and memory complexity in selecting the highest activations, enabling losses and gradients to be computed in $O(n\log{}n)$ time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for high-dimensional vectors and large $k$ values. Furthermore, we provide efficient implementations for both CPU and CUDA environments, underscoring the practicality and scalability of our method for large-scale ranking and differentiable ordering problems.

Abstract: Navigating in environments alongside humans requires agents to reason under uncertainty and account for the beliefs and intentions of those around them. Under a sequential decision-making framework, egocentric navigation can naturally be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). However, social navigation additionally requires reasoning about the hidden beliefs of others, inherently leading to a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where agents lack direct access to others' mental states. Inspired by Theory of Mind and Epistemic Planning, we propose (1) a neuro-symbolic model-based reinforcement learning architecture for social navigation, addressing the challenge of belief tracking in partially observable environments; and (2) a perspective-shift operator for belief estimation, leveraging recent work on Influence-based Abstractions (IBA) in structured multi-agent settings.

Abstract: Causal effect identification using causal graphs is a fundamental challenge in causal inference. While extensive research has been conducted in this area, most existing methods assume the availability of fully specified directed acyclic graphs or acyclic directed mixed graphs. However, in complex domains such as medicine and epidemiology, complete causal knowledge is often unavailable, and only partial information about the system is accessible. This paper focuses on causal effect identification within partially specified causal graphs, with particular emphasis on cluster-directed mixed graphs (C-DMGs) which can represent many different acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs). These graphs provide a higher-level representation of causal relationships by grouping variables into clusters, offering a more practical approach for handling complex systems. Unlike fully specified ADMGs, C-DMGs can contain cycles, which complicate their analysis and interpretation. Furthermore, their cluster-based nature introduces new challenges, as it gives rise to two distinct types of causal effects: macro causal effects and micro causal effects, each with different properties. In this work, we focus on macro causal effects, which describe the effects of entire clusters on other clusters. We establish that the do-calculus is both sound and complete for identifying these effects in C-DMGs over ADMGs when the cluster sizes are either unknown or of size greater than one. Additionally, we provide a graphical characterization of non-identifiability for macro causal effects in these graphs.

Abstract: Automatically conjecturing useful, interesting and novel lemmas would greatly improve automated reasoning tools and lower the bar for formalizing mathematics in proof assistants. It is however a very challenging task for both neural and symbolic approaches. We present the first steps towards a practical neuro-symbolic lemma conjecturing tool, Lemmanaid, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) and symbolic methods, and evaluate it on proof libraries for the Isabelle proof assistant. We train an LLM to generate lemma templates that describe the shape of a lemma, and use symbolic methods to fill in the details. We compare Lemmanaid against an LLM trained to generate complete lemma statements as well as previous fully symbolic conjecturing methods. Lemmanaid outperforms both neural and symbolic methods on test sets from Isabelle's HOL library and from its Archive of Formal Proofs, discovering between 29-39.5% of the gold standard human written lemmas. This is 8-15% more lemmas than the neural-only method. By leveraging the best of both symbolic and neural methods we can generate useful lemmas for a wide range of input domains, facilitating computer-assisted theory development and formalization.

Abstract: This study evaluates the integration of Bloom's Taxonomy into OneClickQuiz, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven plugin for automating Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) generation in Moodle. Bloom's Taxonomy provides a structured framework for categorizing educational objectives into hierarchical cognitive levels. Our research investigates whether incorporating this taxonomy can improve the alignment of AI-generated questions with specific cognitive objectives. We developed a dataset of 3691 questions categorized according to Bloom's levels and employed various classification models-Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC), and a Transformer-based model (DistilBERT)-to evaluate their effectiveness in categorizing questions. Our results indicate that higher Bloom's levels generally correlate with increased question length, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), and Lexical Density (LD), reflecting the increased complexity of higher cognitive demands. Multinomial Logistic Regression showed varying accuracy across Bloom's levels, performing best for "Knowledge" and less accurately for higher-order levels. Merging higher-level categories improved accuracy for complex cognitive tasks. Naive Bayes and Linear SVC also demonstrated effective classification for lower levels but struggled with higher-order tasks. DistilBERT achieved the highest performance, significantly improving classification of both lower and higher-order cognitive levels, achieving an overall validation accuracy of 91%. This study highlights the potential of integrating Bloom's Taxonomy into AI-driven assessment tools and underscores the advantages of advanced models like DistilBERT for enhancing educational content generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to tackle complex tasks, driven by their expanding applications and users' growing proficiency in crafting sophisticated prompts. However, as the number of explicitly stated requirements increases (particularly more than 10 constraints), LLMs often struggle to accurately follow such complex instructions. To address this challenge, we propose RECAST, a novel framework for synthesizing datasets where each example incorporates far more constraints than those in existing benchmarks. These constraints are extracted from real-world prompt-response pairs to ensure practical relevance. RECAST enables automatic verification of constraint satisfaction via rule-based validators for quantitative constraints and LLM-based validators for qualitative ones. Using this framework, we construct RECAST-30K, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 30k instances spanning 15 constraint types. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on RECAST-30K show substantial improvements in following complex instructions. Moreover, the verifiability provided by RECAST enables the design of reward functions for reinforcement learning, which further boosts model performance on complex and challenging tasks.

Abstract: Recent advanced large reasoning models (LRMs) leverage extended chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Despite their success, we identify a critical issue: a substantial portion of simple tasks solved by LRMs can also be addressed by non-reasoning LLMs using significantly fewer tokens, indicating the complex reasoning may not always be necessary. To address this, we systematically analyze the reasoning trajectories of LRMs and present a method utilizing identified paradigms and LLM-Judge to classify these trajectories as either Redundant Reasoning or Essential Reasoning. And we introduce OThink-R1, a method that prunes redundant reasoning steps while preserving logical validity. OThink-R1 dynamically employs the non-thinking mode (fast-thinking) for straightforward problems while engaging in deliberate thinking (slow-thinking) for complex problems. Experiments across mathematical and question-answering tasks demonstrate that OThink-R1 reduces reasoning redundancy by almost 23\% on average without compromising accuracy, offering practical guidelines for efficient reasoning models. The code is available at https://github.com/AgenticIR-Lab/OThink-R1.

Abstract: Failure Analysis (FA) is a highly intricate and knowledge-intensive process. The integration of AI components within the computational infrastructure of FA labs has the potential to automate a variety of tasks, including the detection of non-conformities in images, the retrieval of analogous cases from diverse data sources, and the generation of reports from annotated images. However, as the number of deployed AI models increases, the challenge lies in orchestrating these components into cohesive and efficient workflows that seamlessly integrate with the FA process.
  This paper investigates the design and implementation of an agentic AI system for semiconductor FA using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based Planning Agent (LPA). The LPA integrates LLMs with advanced planning capabilities and external tool utilization, allowing autonomous processing of complex queries, retrieval of relevant data from external systems, and generation of human-readable responses. The evaluation results demonstrate the agent's operational effectiveness and reliability in supporting FA tasks.

Abstract: Legal dispute analysis is crucial for intelligent legal assistance systems. However, current LLMs face significant challenges in understanding complex legal concepts, maintaining reasoning consistency, and accurately citing legal sources. This research presents a framework combining prompt engineering with multidimensional knowledge graphs to improve LLMs' legal dispute analysis. Specifically, the framework includes a three-stage hierarchical prompt structure (task definition, knowledge background, reasoning guidance) along with a three-layer knowledge graph (legal ontology, representation, instance layers). Additionally, four supporting methods enable precise legal concept retrieval: direct code matching, semantic vector similarity, ontology path reasoning, and lexical segmentation. Through extensive testing, results show major improvements: sensitivity increased by 11.1%-11.3%, specificity by 5.4%-6.0%, and citation accuracy by 29.5%-39.7%. As a result, the framework provides better legal analysis and understanding of judicial logic, thus offering a new technical method for intelligent legal assistance systems.

Abstract: Despite advances from medical large language models in healthcare, rare-disease diagnosis remains hampered by insufficient knowledge-representation depth, limited concept understanding, and constrained clinical reasoning. We propose a framework that couples multi-granularity sparse activation of medical concepts with a hierarchical knowledge graph. Four complementary matching algorithms, diversity control, and a five-level fallback strategy enable precise concept activation, while a three-layer knowledge graph (taxonomy, clinical features, instances) provides structured, up-to-date context. Experiments on the BioASQ rare-disease QA set show BLEU gains of 0.09, ROUGE gains of 0.05, and accuracy gains of 0.12, with peak accuracy of 0.89 approaching the 0.90 clinical threshold. Expert evaluation confirms improvements in information quality, reasoning, and professional expression, suggesting our approach shortens the "diagnostic odyssey" for rare-disease patients.

Abstract: We introduce Pareto-NRPA, a new Monte-Carlo algorithm designed for multi-objective optimization problems over discrete search spaces. Extending the Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation (NRPA) algorithm originally formulated for single-objective problems, Pareto-NRPA generalizes the nested search and policy update mechanism to multi-objective optimization. The algorithm uses a set of policies to concurrently explore different regions of the solution space and maintains non-dominated fronts at each level of search. Policy adaptation is performed with respect to the diversity and isolation of sequences within the Pareto front. We benchmark Pareto-NRPA on two classes of problems: a novel bi-objective variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows problem (MO-TSPTW), and a neural architecture search task on well-known benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Pareto-NRPA achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-objective algorithms, both in terms of convergence and diversity of solutions. Particularly, Pareto-NRPA strongly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary multi-objective algorithms on constrained search spaces. To our knowledge, this work constitutes the first adaptation of NRPA to the multi-objective setting.

Abstract: Autonomous agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in a wide range of applications, including web navigation, software development, and embodied control. While most LLMs are limited in several key agentic procedures, such as reliable planning, long-term memory, tool management, and multi-agent coordination, graphs can serve as a powerful auxiliary structure to enhance structure, continuity, and coordination in complex agent workflows. Given the rapid growth and fragmentation of research on Graph-augmented LLM Agents (GLA), this paper offers a timely and comprehensive overview of recent advances and also highlights key directions for future work. Specifically, we categorize existing GLA methods by their primary functions in LLM agent systems, including planning, memory, and tool usage, and then analyze how graphs and graph learning algorithms contribute to each. For multi-agent systems, we further discuss how GLA solutions facilitate the orchestration, efficiency optimization, and trustworthiness of MAS. Finally, we highlight key future directions to advance this field, from improving structural adaptability to enabling unified, scalable, and multimodal GLA systems. We hope this paper can serve as a roadmap for future research on GLA and foster a deeper understanding of the role of graphs in LLM agent systems.

Abstract: Infrared spectroscopy enables rapid, non destructive analysis of chemical and material properties, yet high dimensional signals and overlapping bands hinder conventional chemometric methods. Large language models (LLMs), with strong generalization and reasoning capabilities, offer new opportunities for automated spectral interpretation, but their potential in this domain remains largely untapped. This study introduces LUMIR (LLM-driven Unified agent framework for Multi-task Infrared spectroscopy Reasoning), an agent based framework designed to achieve accurate infrared spectral analysis under low data conditions. LUMIR integrates a structured literature knowledge base, automated preprocessing, feature extraction, and predictive modeling into a unified pipeline. By mining peer reviewed spectroscopy studies, it identifies validated preprocessing and feature derivation strategies, transforms spectra into low dimensional representations, and applies few-shot prompts for classification, regression, and anomaly detection. The framework was validated on diverse datasets, including the publicly available Milk near-infrared dataset, Chinese medicinal herbs, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium(CRP) with different storage durations, an industrial wastewater COD dataset, and two additional public benchmarks, Tecator and Corn. Across these tasks, LUMIR achieved performance comparable to or surpassing established machine learning and deep learning models, particularly in resource limited settings. This work demonstrates that combining structured literature guidance with few-shot learning enables robust, scalable, and automated spectral interpretation. LUMIR establishes a new paradigm for applying LLMs to infrared spectroscopy, offering high accuracy with minimal labeled data and broad applicability across scientific and industrial domains.

Abstract: In this work, we propose MetaAgent, an agentic paradigm inspired by the principle of learning-by-doing, where expertise is developed through hands-on practice and continual self-improvement. MetaAgent starts with a minimal workflow, equipped only with basic reasoning and adaptive help-seeking abilities. When a knowledge gap is encountered, MetaAgent generates natural language help requests, which are routed to the most suitable external tool by a dedicated tool router. As MetaAgent solves tasks, it continually conducts self-reflection and answer verification, distilling actionable experience into concise texts that are dynamically incorporated into future task contexts. Besides, MetaAgent autonomously builds in-house tools and a persistent knowledge base by organizing its tool-use history, further enhancing its ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information We term this continual, data-driven process as \textit{meta tool learning}, through which MetaAgent incrementally refines its reasoning and tool-use strategies, without changing model parameters or requiring further post-training. Evaluated on challenging knowledge discovery benchmarks, including GAIA, WebWalkerQA, and BrowseCamp, MetaAgent consistently outperforms workflow-based baselines and matches or exceeds end-to-end trained agents, demonstrating the promise of self-evolving agentic systems for robust, general-purpose knowledge discovery. We provide our source codes in https://github.com/qhjqhj00/MetaAgent.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have sparked growing interest in AI agents capable of solving complex, real-world tasks. However, most existing agent systems rely on manually crafted configurations that remain static after deployment, limiting their ability to adapt to dynamic and evolving environments. To this end, recent research has explored agent evolution techniques that aim to automatically enhance agent systems based on interaction data and environmental feedback. This emerging direction lays the foundation for self-evolving AI agents, which bridge the static capabilities of foundation models with the continuous adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques for self-evolving agentic systems. Specifically, we first introduce a unified conceptual framework that abstracts the feedback loop underlying the design of self-evolving agentic systems. The framework highlights four key components: System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers, serving as a foundation for understanding and comparing different strategies. Based on this framework, we systematically review a wide range of self-evolving techniques that target different components of the agent system. We also investigate domain-specific evolution strategies developed for specialised fields such as biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimisation objectives are tightly coupled with domain constraints. In addition, we provide a dedicated discussion on the evaluation, safety, and ethical considerations for self-evolving agentic systems, which are critical to ensuring their effectiveness and reliability. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the foundation for the development of more adaptive, autonomous, and lifelong agentic systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches, a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is publicly accessible at https://www.tbox.cn/about/model-ranking.

Abstract: This paper introduces GUI-Owl, a foundational GUI agent model that achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source end-to-end models on ten GUI benchmarks across desktop and mobile environments, covering grounding, question answering, planning, decision-making, and procedural knowledge. GUI-Owl-7B achieves 66.4 on AndroidWorld and 29.4 on OSWorld. Building on this, we propose Mobile-Agent-v3, a general-purpose GUI agent framework that further improves performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment. We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are open-sourced at https://github.com/X-PLUG/MobileAgent.

Abstract: We introduce Net2Brain, a graphical and command-line user interface toolbox for comparing the representational spaces of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) and human brain recordings. While different toolboxes facilitate only single functionalities or only focus on a small subset of supervised image classification models, Net2Brain allows the extraction of activations of more than 600 DNNs trained to perform a diverse range of vision-related tasks (e.g semantic segmentation, depth estimation, action recognition, etc.), over both image and video datasets. The toolbox computes the representational dissimilarity matrices (RDMs) over those activations and compares them to brain recordings using representational similarity analysis (RSA), weighted RSA, both in specific ROIs and with searchlight search. In addition, it is possible to add a new data set of stimuli and brain recordings to the toolbox for evaluation. We demonstrate the functionality and advantages of Net2Brain with an example showcasing how it can be used to test hypotheses of cognitive computational neuroscience.

<title>Cross-Modal Adapter for Vision-Language Retrieval</title>

arXiv:2211.09623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language retrieval is an important multi-modal learning topic, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant visual candidate for a given text query. Recently, pre-trained models, e.g., CLIP, show great potential on retrieval tasks. However, as pre-trained models are scaling up, fully fine-tuning them on donwstream retrieval datasets has a high risk of overfitting. Moreover, in practice, it would be costly to train and store a large model for each task. To overcome the above issues, we present a novel Cross-Modal Adapter for parameter-efficient transfer learning. Inspired by adapter-based methods, we adjust the pre-trained model with a few parameterization layers. However, there are two notable differences. First, our method is designed for the multi-modal domain. Secondly, it allows encoder-level implicit cross-modal interactions between vision and language encoders. Although surprisingly simple, our approach has three notable benefits: (1) reduces the vast majority of fine-tuned parameters, (2) saves training time, and (3) allows all the pre-trained parameters to be fixed, enabling the pre-trained model to be shared across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, without bells and whistles, our approach outperforms adapter-based methods on image-text retrieval datasets (MSCOCO, Flickr30K) and video-text retrieval datasets (MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, and ActivityNet).

<title>Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification</title>

Abstract: Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of dot-product attention introduced in Transformer remains a fundamental bottleneck impeding the progress of foundation models toward unbounded context lengths. Addressing this challenge, we introduce the Deep Tensor Network, a new architectural framework that fundamentally reformulates attention by unifying the expressive power of tensor algebra with neural network design. Our approach moves beyond both conventional dot-product attention and subsequent linear-time approximations to capture higher-order statistical dependencies. We introduce two core operators derived from this framework: \emph{Tensor Attention}, which models complex token-mixing via data-dependent polynomial kernels, and Tensor Interaction, a novel mechanism for adaptive channel-mixing. We demonstrate that these operators are powered by second-order summaries that entirely bypass the formation of $n \times n$ matrices, enabling a causality-preserving streaming implementation with $O(d^2)$ per-token updates and $O(d^2)$ state. This efficiency rivals that of modern State Space Models while retaining an attention-like formulation. The Deep Tensor Network thus provides a principled and powerful new class of building blocks for next-generation sequence models, bridging the gap between scalable computation and rich, expressive interaction modeling.

<title>An Information-Flow Perspective on Algorithmic Fairness</title>

Abstract: This work presents insights gained by investigating the relationship between algorithmic fairness and the concept of secure information flow. The problem of enforcing secure information flow is well-studied in the context of information security: If secret information may "flow" through an algorithm or program in such a way that it can influence the program's output, then that is considered insecure information flow as attackers could potentially observe (parts of) the secret.
  There is a strong correspondence between secure information flow and algorithmic fairness: if protected attributes such as race, gender, or age are treated as secret program inputs, then secure information flow means that these ``secret'' attributes cannot influence the result of a program. While most research in algorithmic fairness evaluation concentrates on studying the impact of algorithms (often treating the algorithm as a black-box), the concepts derived from information flow can be used both for the analysis of disparate treatment as well as disparate impact w.r.t. a structural causal model.
  In this paper, we examine the relationship between quantitative as well as qualitative information-flow properties and fairness. Moreover, based on this duality, we derive a new quantitative notion of fairness called fairness spread, which can be easily analyzed using quantitative information flow and which strongly relates to counterfactual fairness. We demonstrate that off-the-shelf tools for information-flow properties can be used in order to formally analyze a program's algorithmic fairness properties, including the new notion of fairness spread as well as established notions such as demographic parity.

<title>Exploring Large Language Models in Resolving Environment-Related Crash Bugs: Localizing and Repairing</title>

Abstract: Software crash bugs cause unexpected program behaviors or even abrupt termination, thus demanding immediate resolution. However, resolving crash bugs can be challenging due to their complex root causes, which can originate from issues in the source code or external factors like third-party library dependencies. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering tasks. However, existing research predominantly focuses on the capability of LLMs to localize and repair code-related crash bugs, leaving their effectiveness in resolving environment-related crash bugs in real-world software unexplored. To fill this gap, we conducted the first comprehensive study to assess the capability of LLMs in resolving real-world environment-related crash bugs. We first systematically compare LLMs' performance in resolving code-related and environment-related crash bugs with varying levels of crash contextual information. Our findings reveal that localization is the primary challenge for resolving code-related crashes, while repair poses a greater challenge for environment-related crashes. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different prompt strategies on improving the resolution of environment-related crash bugs, incorporating different prompt templates and multi-round interactions. Building on this, we further explore an advanced active inquiry prompting strategy leveraging the self-planning capabilities of LLMs. Based on these explorations, we propose IntDiagSolver, an interactive methodology designed to enable precise crash bug resolution through ongoing engagement with LLMs. Extensive evaluations of IntDiagSolver across multiple LLMs (including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, CodeLlama, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen-3-Coder) demonstrate consistent improvements in resolution accuracy, with substantial enhancements ranging from 9.1% to 43.3% in localization and 9.1% to 53.3% in repair.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have significantly reshaped text generation, particularly in the realm of writing assistance. While ethical considerations underscore the importance of transparently acknowledging LLM use, especially in scientific communication, genuine acknowledgment remains infrequent. A potential avenue to encourage accurate acknowledging of LLM-assisted writing involves employing automated detectors. Our evaluation of four cutting-edge LLM-generated text detectors reveals their suboptimal performance compared to a simple ad-hoc detector designed to identify abrupt writing style changes around the time of LLM proliferation. We contend that the development of specialized detectors exclusively dedicated to LLM-assisted writing detection is necessary. Such detectors could play a crucial role in fostering more authentic recognition of LLM involvement in scientific communication, addressing the current challenges in acknowledgment practices.

<title>Redesigning Traffic Signs to Mitigate Machine-Learning Patch Attacks</title>

Abstract: Traffic-Sign Recognition (TSR) is a critical safety component for autonomous driving. Unfortunately, however, past work has highlighted the vulnerability of TSR models to physical-world attacks, through low-cost, easily deployable adversarial patches leading to misclassification. To mitigate these threats, most defenses focus on altering the training process or modifying the inference procedure. Still, while these approaches improve adversarial robustness, TSR remains susceptible to attacks attaining substantial success rates.
  To further the adversarial robustness of TSR, this work offers a novel approach that redefines traffic-sign designs to create signs that promote robustness while remaining interpretable to humans. Our framework takes three inputs: (1) A traffic-sign standard along with modifiable features and associated constraints; (2) A state-of-the-art adversarial training method; and (3) A function for efficiently synthesizing realistic traffic-sign images. Using these user-defined inputs, the framework emits an optimized traffic-sign standard such that traffic signs generated per this standard enable training TSR models with increased adversarial robustness.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework via a concrete implementation, where we allow modifying the pictograms (i.e., symbols) and colors of traffic signs. The results show substantial improvements in robustness -- with gains of up to 16.33%--24.58% in robust accuracy over state-of-the-art methods -- while benign accuracy is even improved. Importantly, a user study also confirms that the redesigned traffic signs remain easily recognizable and to human observers. Overall, the results highlight that carefully redesigning traffic signs can significantly enhance TSR system robustness without compromising human interpretability.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown exceptional performance across various applications, enabling autonomous agents to learn optimal policies through interaction with their environments. However, traditional RL frameworks often face challenges in terms of iteration efficiency and safety. Risk-sensitive policy gradient methods, which incorporate both expected return and risk measures, have been explored for their ability to yield safe policies, yet their iteration complexity remains largely underexplored. In this work, we conduct a rigorous iteration complexity analysis for the risk-sensitive policy gradient method, focusing on the REINFORCE algorithm with an exponential utility function. We establish an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point (FOSP). Furthermore, we investigate whether risk-sensitive algorithms can achieve better iteration complexity compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. Our analysis indicates that risk-sensitive REINFORCE can potentially converge faster. To validate our analysis, we empirically evaluate the learning performance and convergence efficiency of the risk-neutral and risk-sensitive REINFORCE algorithms in multiple environments: CartPole, MiniGrid, and Robot Navigation. Empirical results confirm that risk-sensitive cases can converge and stabilize faster compared to their risk-neutral counterparts. More details can be found on our website https://anonymous.4open.science/w/riskrl.

<title>On the Impact of Black-box Deployment Strategies for Edge AI on Latency and Model Performance</title>

Abstract: Deciding what combination of operators to use across the Edge AI tiers to achieve specific latency and model performance requirements is an open question for MLOps engineers. This study aims to empirically assess the accuracy vs inference time trade-off of different black-box Edge AI deployment strategies, i.e., combinations of deployment operators and deployment tiers. In this paper, we conduct inference experiments involving 3 deployment operators (i.e., Partitioning, Quantization, Early Exit), 3 deployment tiers (i.e., Mobile, Edge, Cloud) and their combinations on four widely used Computer-Vision models to investigate the optimal strategies from the point of view of MLOps developers. Our findings suggest that Edge deployment using the hybrid Quantization + Early Exit operator could be preferred over non-hybrid operators (Quantization/Early Exit on Edge, Partition on Mobile-Edge) when faster latency is a concern at medium accuracy loss. However, when minimizing accuracy loss is a concern, MLOps engineers should prefer using only a Quantization operator on edge at a latency reduction or increase, respectively over the Early Exit/Partition (on edge/mobile-edge) and Quantized Early Exit (on edge) operators. In scenarios constrained by Mobile CPU/RAM resources, a preference for Partitioning across mobile and edge tiers is observed over mobile deployment. For models with smaller input data samples (such as FCN), a network-constrained cloud deployment can also be a better alternative than Mobile/Edge deployment and Partitioning strategies. For models with large input data samples (ResNet, ResNext, DUC), an edge tier having higher network/computational capabilities than Cloud/Mobile can be a more viable option than Partitioning and Mobile/Cloud deployment strategies.

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) remains one of the last NLP tasks where large language models (LLMs) have not yet replaced dedicated supervised systems. This work exploits the complementary strengths of LLMs and supervised MT by guiding LLMs to automatically post-edit MT with external feedback on its quality, derived from Multidimensional Quality Metric (MQM) annotations. Working with LLaMA-2 models, we consider prompting strategies varying the nature of feedback provided and then fine-tune the LLM to improve its ability to exploit the provided guidance. Through experiments on Chinese-English, English-German, and English-Russian MQM data, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to post-edit MT improves TER, BLEU and COMET scores, although the benefits of fine-grained feedback are not clear. Fine-tuning helps integrate fine-grained feedback more effectively and further improves translation quality based on both automatic and human evaluation.

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal dataset for Cognitive Load Assessment in REal-time (CLARE). The dataset contains physiological and gaze data from 24 participants with self-reported cognitive load scores as ground-truth labels. The dataset consists of four modalities, namely, Electrocardiography (ECG), Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Electroencephalogram (EEG), and Gaze tracking. To map diverse levels of mental load on participants during experiments, each participant completed four nine-minutes sessions on a computer-based operator performance and mental workload task (the MATB-II software) with varying levels of complexity in one minute segments. During the experiment, participants reported their cognitive load every 10 seconds. For the dataset, we also provide benchmark binary classification results with machine learning and deep learning models on two different evaluation schemes, namely, 10-fold and leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation. Benchmark results show that for 10-fold evaluation, the convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning model achieves the best classification performance with ECG, EDA, and Gaze. In contrast, for LOSO, the best performance is achieved by the deep learning model with ECG, EDA, and EEG.

Abstract: Incremental learning is the ability of systems to acquire knowledge over time, enabling their adaptation and generalization to novel tasks. It is a critical ability for intelligent, real-world systems, especially when data changes frequently or is limited. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of incremental learning in Large Language Models. It synthesizes the state-of-the-art incremental learning paradigms, including continual learning, meta-learning, parameter-efficient learning, and mixture-of-experts learning. We demonstrate their utility for incremental learning by describing specific achievements from these related topics and their critical factors. An important finding is that many of these approaches do not update the core model, and none of them update incrementally in real-time. The paper highlights current problems and challenges for future research in the field. By consolidating the latest relevant research developments, this review offers a comprehensive understanding of incremental learning and its implications for designing and developing LLM-based learning systems.

Abstract: Regional socioeconomic indicators are critical across various domains, yet their acquisition can be costly. Inferring global socioeconomic indicators from a limited number of regional samples is essential for enhancing management and sustainability in urban areas and human settlements. Current inference methods typically rely on spatial interpolation based on the assumption of spatial continuity, which does not adequately address the complex variations present within regional spaces. In this paper, we present GeoHG, the first space-aware socioeconomic indicator inference method that utilizes a heterogeneous graph-based structure to represent geospace for non-continuous inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoHG in comparison to existing methods, achieving an $R^2$ score exceeding 0.8 under extreme data scarcity with a masked ratio of 95\%.

<title>Leveraging Offline Data in Linear Latent Contextual Bandits</title>

Abstract: Leveraging offline data is an attractive way to accelerate online sequential decision-making. However, it is crucial to account for latent states in users or environments in the offline data, and latent bandits form a compelling model for doing so. In this light, we design end-to-end latent bandit algorithms capable of handing uncountably many latent states. We focus on a linear latent contextual bandit $-$ a linear bandit where each user has its own high-dimensional reward parameter in $\mathbb{R}^{d_A}$, but reward parameters across users lie in a low-rank latent subspace of dimension $d_K \ll d_A$. First, we provide an offline algorithm to learn this subspace with provable guarantees. We then present two online algorithms that utilize the output of this offline algorithm to accelerate online learning. The first enjoys $\tilde{O}(\min(d_A\sqrt{T}, d_K\sqrt{T}(1+\sqrt{d_AT/d_KN})))$ regret guarantees, so that the effective dimension is lower when the size $N$ of the offline dataset is larger. We prove a matching lower bound on regret, showing that our algorithm is minimax optimal. The second is a practical algorithm that enjoys only a slightly weaker guarantee, but is computationally efficient. We also establish the efficacy of our methods using experiments on both synthetic data and real-life movie recommendation data from MovieLens. Finally, we theoretically establish the generality of the latent bandit model by proving a de Finetti theorem for stateless decision processes.

<title>Intrinsic Test of Unlearning Using Parametric Knowledge Traces</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11614</link>

arXiv:2406.11614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The task of "unlearning" certain concepts in large language models (LLMs) has attracted immense attention recently, due to its importance in mitigating undesirable model behaviours, such as the generation of harmful, private, or incorrect information. Current protocols to evaluate unlearning methods largely rely on behavioral tests, without monitoring the presence of unlearned knowledge within the model's parameters. This residual knowledge can be adversarially exploited to recover the erased information post-unlearning. We argue that unlearning should also be evaluated internally, by considering changes in the parametric knowledge traces of the unlearned concepts. To this end, we propose a general evaluation methodology that leverages vocabulary projections to inspect concepts encoded in model parameters. We use this approach to localize "concept vectors" - parameter vectors that encode concrete concepts - and construct ConceptVectors, a benchmark dataset containing hundreds of common concepts and their parametric knowledge traces within two open-source LLMs. Evaluation on ConceptVectors shows that existing unlearning methods minimally impact concept vectors and mostly suppress them during inference, while directly ablating these vectors demonstrably removes the associated knowledge and significantly reduces the model's susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. Our results highlight limitations in behavioral-based unlearning evaluations and call for future work to include parameter-based evaluations. To support this, we release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/yihuaihong/ConceptVectors.

<title>Decentralized Transformers with Centralized Aggregation are Sample-Efficient Multi-Agent World Models</title>

Abstract: Learning a world model for model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can significantly improve the sample efficiency by learning policies in imagination. However, building a world model for Multi-Agent RL (MARL) can be particularly challenging due to the scalability issue in a centralized architecture arising from a large number of agents, and also the non-stationarity issue in a decentralized architecture stemming from the inter-dependency among agents. To address both challenges, we propose a novel world model for MARL that learns decentralized local dynamics for scalability, combined with a centralized representation aggregation from all agents. We cast the dynamics learning as an auto-regressive sequence modeling problem over discrete tokens by leveraging the expressive Transformer architecture, in order to model complex local dynamics across different agents and provide accurate and consistent long-term imaginations. As the first pioneering Transformer-based world model for multi-agent systems, we introduce a Perceiver Transformer as an effective solution to enable centralized representation aggregation within this context. Results on Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) show that it outperforms strong model-free approaches and existing model-based methods in both sample efficiency and overall performance.

Abstract: Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity. Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden states. We present a practical framework for instantiating sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and expressive hidden states. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Similar to Transformer, TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Natural physical, chemical, and biological dynamical systems are often complex, with heterogeneous components interacting in diverse ways. We show how simple graph neural networks can be designed to jointly learn the interaction rules and the latent heterogeneity from observable dynamics. The learned latent heterogeneity and dynamics can be used to virtually decompose the complex system which is necessary to infer and parameterize the underlying governing equations. We tested the approach with simulation experiments of interacting moving particles, vector fields, and signaling networks. While our current aim is to better understand and validate the approach with simulated data, we anticipate it to become a generally applicable tool to uncover the governing rules underlying complex dynamics observed in nature.

<title>Learn while Unlearn: An Iterative Unlearning Framework for Generative Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP), have produced powerful models trained on vast datasets. However, these models risk leaking sensitive information, raising privacy concerns. In response, regulatory measures such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) have driven increasing interest in Machine Unlearning techniques, which enable models to selectively forget specific data entries. Early unlearning approaches primarily relied on pre-processing methods, while more recent research has shifted towards training-based solutions. Despite their effectiveness, a key limitation persists: most methods require access to original training data, which is often unavailable. Additionally, directly applying unlearning techniques bears the cost of undermining the model's expressive capabilities. To address these challenges, we introduce the Iterative Contrastive Unlearning (ICU) framework, which consists of three core components: A Knowledge Unlearning Induction module designed to target specific knowledge for removal using an unlearning loss; A Contrastive Learning Enhancement module to preserve the model's expressive capabilities against the pure unlearning goal; And an Iterative Unlearning Refinement module that dynamically adjusts the unlearning process through ongoing evaluation and updates. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our ICU method in unlearning sensitive information while maintaining the model's overall performance, offering a promising solution for privacy-conscious machine learning applications.

<title>MEGen: Generative Backdoor into Large Language Models via Model Editing</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable versatility and adaptability, while their widespread adoption across various applications also raises critical safety concerns. This paper focuses on the impact of backdoored LLMs. Traditional backdoor injection methods are primarily limited to yes-or-no discriminative tasks, leading users to underestimate the potential risks of backdoored LLMs. Given the inherently generative nature of LLMs, this paper reveals that a generative backdoor injected into LLMs can expose the true safety risks in their applications. We propose an editing-based generative backdoor, named MEGen, aiming to expand the backdoor to generative tasks in a unified format of any text-to any text, leading to natural generations with a specific intention. Experiments show that MEGen achieves a high attack success rate by adjusting only a small set of local parameters with few-shot samples. Notably, we show that the backdoored model, when triggered, can freely output pre-set dangerous information while completing downstream tasks. Our work highlights that MEGen enables backdoors in LLMs to exhibit generative capabilities, causing potential safety risks by altering the generative style. The code is available at https://github.com/MonoQ-hub/MEGen.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini have significantly advanced natural language processing, enabling various applications such as chatbots and automated content generation. However, these models can be exploited by malicious individuals who craft toxic prompts to elicit harmful or unethical responses. These individuals often employ jailbreaking techniques to bypass safety mechanisms, highlighting the need for robust toxic prompt detection methods. Existing detection techniques, both blackbox and whitebox, face challenges related to the diversity of toxic prompts, scalability, and computational efficiency. In response, we propose ToxicDetector, a lightweight greybox method designed to efficiently detect toxic prompts in LLMs. ToxicDetector leverages LLMs to create toxic concept prompts, uses embedding vectors to form feature vectors, and employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier for prompt classification. Our evaluation on various versions of the LLama models, Gemma-2, and multiple datasets demonstrates that ToxicDetector achieves a high accuracy of 96.39\% and a low false positive rate of 2.00\%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ToxicDetector's processing time of 0.0780 seconds per prompt makes it highly suitable for real-time applications. ToxicDetector achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, making it a practical method for toxic prompt detection in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely employed across various application domains, yet their black-box nature poses significant challenges to understanding how these models process input data internally to make predictions. In this paper, we introduce a precise and quantitative law that governs the learning of contextualized token embeddings through intermediate layers in pre-trained LLMs for next-token prediction. Our findings reveal that each layer contributes equally to enhancing prediction accuracy, from the lowest to the highest layer -- a universal phenomenon observed across a diverse array of open-source LLMs, irrespective of their architectures or pre-training data. We demonstrate that this law offers new perspectives and actionable insights to inform and guide practices in LLM development and applications, including model scaling, pre-training tasks, and interpretation.

Abstract: The emergence of deep learning models has revolutionized various industries over the last decade, leading to a surge in connected devices and infrastructures. However, these models can be tricked into making incorrect predictions with high confidence, leading to disastrous failures and security concerns. To this end, we explore the impact of adversarial attacks on multivariate time-series forecasting and investigate methods to counter them. Specifically, we employ untargeted white-box attacks, namely the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and the Basic Iterative Method (BIM), to poison the inputs to the training process, effectively misleading the model. We also illustrate the subtle modifications to the inputs after the attack, which makes detecting the attack using the naked eye quite difficult. Having demonstrated the feasibility of these attacks, we develop robust models through adversarial training and model hardening. We are among the first to showcase the transferability of these attacks and defenses by extrapolating our work from the benchmark electricity data to a larger, 10-year real-world data used for predicting the time-to-failure of hard disks. Our experimental results confirm that the attacks and defenses achieve the desired security thresholds, leading to a 72.41% and 94.81% decrease in RMSE for the electricity and hard disk datasets respectively after implementing the adversarial defenses.

Abstract: While Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in general multimodal tasks, they lack the domain-specific knowledge for industrial vibration signal analysis. This paper introduces VSLLaVA, a comprehensive pipeline that utilizes expert knowledge-guided instruction tuning and evaluation to create an end-to-end LMM for signal analysis. To achieve this, we construct a novel Signal-Question-Answer (SQA) dataset using an expert rule-based signal generator. This dataset facilitates a two-stage learning procedure. The first step is efficient instruction fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which imparts specialized signal identification capabilities. Subsequently, we designed a tailored Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the reasoning capabilities and enhance classification robustness. Then, a dual-mode evaluation framework is proposed, combining an LLM referee with expert rules for semantic assessment using quantitative metrics for numerical and textual accuracy, which reveals that VSLLaVA significantly improves performance in signal type identification and parameter analysis, and makes progress in the identification and parameter analysis of fault-related signals. This research demonstrates a viable approach for developing specialized foundational models for complex industrial applications and marks a transition from conventional task-specific systems to a cohesive, interactive foundational model.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many tasks but often falter on complex problems that require structured, multi-step reasoning. We introduce the Diagram of Thought (DoT), a new framework that enables a single LLM to build and navigate a mental map of its reasoning. Instead of thinking in a straight line, the model constructs a dynamic diagram of ideas, where it can propose different lines of thought, critique its own steps, and synthesize validated insights into a final conclusion. This entire process is self-contained within the model, making it highly efficient by avoiding the complex external controllers or search algorithms required by other methods. To ensure the reliability of this process, we ground DoT in a rigorous mathematical framework from category theory. This foundation guarantees that the way the model combines information is logical, consistent, and robust, regardless of the order in which ideas were explored. The result is a more powerful and transparent reasoning process that produces a fully auditable, step-by-step trace of the LLM's thinking, bridging the gap between fluent language and formal reasoning.

<title>Mitigating Semantic Leakage in Cross-lingual Embeddings via Orthogonality Constraint</title>

Abstract: Accurately aligning contextual representations in cross-lingual sentence embeddings is key for effective parallel data mining. A common strategy for achieving this alignment involves disentangling semantics and language in sentence embeddings derived from multilingual pre-trained models. However, we discover that current disentangled representation learning methods suffer from semantic leakage - a term we introduce to describe when a substantial amount of language-specific information is unintentionally leaked into semantic representations. This hinders the effective disentanglement of semantic and language representations, making it difficult to retrieve embeddings that distinctively represent the meaning of the sentence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel training objective, ORthogonAlity Constraint LEarning (ORACLE), tailored to enforce orthogonality between semantic and language embeddings. ORACLE builds upon two components: intra-class clustering and inter-class separation. Through experiments on cross-lingual retrieval and semantic textual similarity tasks, we demonstrate that training with the ORACLE objective effectively reduces semantic leakage and enhances semantic alignment within the embedding space.

Abstract: While conventional wisdom holds that policy gradient methods are better suited to complex action spaces than action-value methods, foundational work has shown that the two paradigms are equivalent in small, finite action spaces (O'Donoghue et al., 2017; Schulman et al., 2017a). This raises the question of why their computational applicability and performance diverge as the complexity of the action space increases. We hypothesize that the apparent superiority of policy gradients in such settings stems not from intrinsic qualities of the paradigm but from universal principles that can also be applied to action-value methods, enabling similar functions. We identify three such principles and provide a framework for incorporating them into action-value methods. To support our hypothesis, we instantiate this framework in what we term QMLE, for Q-learning with maximum likelihood estimation. Our results show that QMLE can be applied to complex action spaces at a computational cost comparable to that of policy gradient methods, all without using policy gradients. Furthermore, QMLE exhibits strong performance on the DeepMind Control Suite, even when compared to state-of-the-art methods such as DMPO and D4PG.

<title>Learning by Surprise: Surplexity for Mitigating Model Collapse in Generative AI</title>

Abstract: As synthetic content increasingly infiltrates the web, generative AI models may be retrained on their own outputs: a process termed "autophagy". This leads to model collapse: a progressive loss of performance and diversity across generations. Recent studies have examined the emergence of model collapse across various generative AI models and data types, and have proposed mitigation strategies that rely on incorporating human-authored content. However, current characterizations of model collapse remain limited, and existing mitigation methods assume reliable knowledge of whether training data is human-authored or AI-generated. In this paper, we address these gaps by introducing new measures that characterise collapse directly from a model's next-token probability distributions, rather than from properties of AI-generated text. Using these measures, we show that the degree of collapse depends on the complexity of the initial training set, as well as on the extent of autophagy. Our experiments prompt a new suggestion: that model collapse occurs when a model trains on data that does not "surprise" it. We express this hypothesis in terms of the well-known Free Energy Principle in cognitive science. Building on this insight, we propose a practical mitigation strategy: filtering training items by high surplexity, maximising the surprise of the model. Unlike existing methods, this approach does not require distinguishing between human- and AI-generated data. Experiments across datasets and models demonstrate that our strategy is at least as effective as human-data baselines, and even more effective in reducing distributional skewedness. Our results provide a richer understanding of model collapse and point toward more resilient approaches for training generative AI systems in environments increasingly saturated with synthetic data.

Abstract: In the visual spatial understanding (VSU) area, spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and spatial text-to-image (ST2I) are two fundamental tasks that appear in dual form. Existing methods for standalone SI2T or ST2I perform imperfectly in spatial understanding, due to the difficulty of 3D-wise spatial feature modeling. In this work, we consider modeling the SI2T and ST2I together under a dual learning framework. During the dual framework, we then propose to represent the 3D spatial scene features with a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation that can be shared and beneficial to both tasks. Further, inspired by the intuition that the easier 3D$\to$image and 3D$\to$text processes also exist symmetrically in the ST2I and SI2T, respectively, we propose the Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD$^3$) framework, which utilizes the intermediate features of the 3D$\to$X processes to guide the hard X$\to$3D processes, such that the overall ST2I and SI2T will benefit each other. On the visual spatial understanding dataset VSD, our system outperforms the mainstream T2I and I2T methods significantly. Further in-depth analysis reveals how our dual learning strategy advances.

<title>Beyond the Kolmogorov Barrier: A Learnable Weighted Hybrid Autoencoder for Model Order Reduction</title>

Abstract: Representation learning for high-dimensional, complex physical systems aims to identify a low-dimensional intrinsic latent space, which is crucial for reduced-order modeling and modal analysis. To overcome the well-known Kolmogorov barrier, deep autoencoders (AEs) have been introduced in recent years, but they often suffer from poor convergence behavior as the rank of the latent space increases. To address this issue, we propose the learnable weighted hybrid autoencoder, a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of singular value decomposition (SVD) with deep autoencoders through a learnable weighted framework. We find that the introduction of learnable weighting parameters is essential -- without them, the resulting model would either collapse into a standard POD or fail to exhibit the desired convergence behavior. Interestingly, we empirically find that our trained model has a sharpness thousands of times smaller compared to other models. Our experiments on classical chaotic PDE systems, including the 1D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and forced isotropic turbulence datasets, demonstrate that our approach significantly improves generalization performance compared to several competing methods. Additionally, when combining with time series modeling techniques (e.g., Koopman operator, LSTM), the proposed technique offers significant improvements for surrogate modeling of high-dimensional multi-scale PDE systems.

Abstract: The promising applications of large language models are often limited by the constrained GPU memory capacity available on edge devices. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models help address this issue by activating only a subset of the model's parameters during computation. This approach allows the unused parameters to be offloaded to host memory, thereby reducing the overall GPU memory demand. However, existing cache-based offloading solutions handle cache misses reactively, which significantly impacts system performance. In this paper, we introduce ProMoE, a novel proactive caching system that utilizes intermediate results to predict subsequent expert usage. By proactively fetching experts in advance, ProMoE eliminates passive cache misses, removes loading time from the critical path, and reduces the performance overhead associated with offloading. Our evaluations demonstrate that ProMoE achieves an average speedup of 2.20x (up to 3.21x) and 2.07x (up to 5.02x) in the prefill and decode stages, respectively, compared to existing offloading solutions.

<title>Exploring Response Uncertainty in MLLMs: An Empirical Evaluation under Misleading Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on tasks ranging from visual question answering to video understanding. However, existing studies have concentrated mainly on visual-textual misalignment, leaving largely unexplored the MLLMs' ability to preserve an originally correct answer when confronted with misleading information. We reveal a response uncertainty phenomenon: across nine standard datasets, twelve state-of-the-art open-source MLLMs overturn a previously correct answer in 65% of cases after receiving a single deceptive cue. To systematically quantify this vulnerability, we propose a two-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) elicit each model's original response on unperturbed inputs; (2) inject explicit (false-answer hints) and implicit (contextual contradictions) misleading instructions, and compute the misleading rate - the fraction of correct-to-incorrect flips. Leveraging the most susceptible examples, we curate the Multimodal Uncertainty Benchmark (MUB), a collection of image-question pairs stratified into low, medium, and high difficulty based on how many of twelve state-of-the-art MLLMs they mislead. Extensive evaluation on twelve open-source and five closed-source models reveals a high uncertainty: average misleading rates exceed 86%, with explicit cues over 67.19% and implicit cues over 80.67%. To reduce the misleading rate, we then fine-tune all open-source MLLMs on a compact 2000-sample mixed-instruction dataset, reducing misleading rates to 6.97% (explicit) and 32.77% (implicit), boosting consistency by nearly 29.37% on highly deceptive inputs, and slightly improving accuracy on standard benchmarks.

<title>A Computational Method for Measuring "Open Codes" in Qualitative Analysis</title>

Abstract: Qualitative analysis is critical to understanding human datasets in many social science disciplines. A central method in this process is inductive coding, where researchers identify and interpret codes directly from the datasets themselves. Yet, this exploratory approach poses challenges for meeting methodological expectations (such as ``depth'' and ``variation''), especially as researchers increasingly adopt Generative AI (GAI) for support. Ground-truth-based metrics are insufficient because they contradict the exploratory nature of inductive coding, while manual evaluation can be labor-intensive. This paper presents a theory-informed computational method for measuring inductive coding results from humans and GAI. Our method first merges individual codebooks using an LLM-enriched algorithm. It measures each coder's contribution against the merged result using four novel metrics: Coverage, Overlap, Novelty, and Divergence. Through two experiments on a human-coded online conversation dataset, we 1) reveal the merging algorithm's impact on metrics; 2) validate the metrics' stability and robustness across multiple runs and different LLMs; and 3) showcase the metrics' ability to diagnose coding issues, such as excessive or irrelevant (hallucinated) codes. Our work provides a reliable pathway for ensuring methodological rigor in human-AI qualitative analysis.

<title>EFTViT: Efficient Federated Training of Vision Transformers with Masked Images on Resource-Constrained Clients</title>

Abstract: Federated learning research has recently shifted from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs) due to their superior capacity. ViTs training demands higher computational resources due to the lack of 2D inductive biases inherent in CNNs. However, efficient federated training of ViTs on resource-constrained edge devices remains unexplored in the community. In this paper, we propose EFTViT, a hierarchical federated framework that leverages masked images to enable efficient, full-parameter training on resource-constrained edge devices, offering substantial benefits for learning on heterogeneous data. In general, we patchify images and randomly mask a portion of the patches, observing that excluding them from training has minimal impact on performance while substantially reducing computation costs and enhancing data content privacy protection. Specifically, EFTViT comprises a series of lightweight local modules and a larger global module, updated independently on clients and the central server, respectively. The local modules are trained on masked image patches, while the global module is trained on intermediate patch features uploaded from the local client, balanced through a proposed median sampling strategy to erase client data distribution privacy. We analyze the computational complexity and privacy protection of EFTViT. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that EFTViT achieves up to 28.17% accuracy improvement, reduces local training computational cost by up to 2.8$\times$, and cuts local training time by up to 4.4$\times$ compared to existing methods.

arXiv:2412.02176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces SmartBSP, an advanced self-supervised learning framework for real-time path planning and obstacle avoidance in autonomous robotics navigating through complex environments. The proposed system integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Actor-Critic architecture to process limited LIDAR inputs and compute spatial decision-making probabilities. The robot's perceptual field is discretized into a grid format, which the CNN analyzes to produce a spatial probability distribution. During the training process a nuanced cost function is minimized that accounts for path curvature, endpoint proximity, and obstacle avoidance. Simulations results in different scenarios validate the algorithm's resilience and adaptability across diverse operational scenarios. Subsequently, Real-time experiments, employing the Robot Operating System (ROS), were carried out to assess the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.

Abstract: Low-resource languages serve as invaluable repositories of human history, embodying cultural evolution and intellectual diversity. Despite their significance, these languages face critical challenges, including data scarcity and technological limitations, which hinder their comprehensive study and preservation. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer transformative opportunities for addressing these challenges, enabling innovative methodologies in linguistic, historical, and cultural research. This study systematically evaluates the applications of LLMs in low-resource language research, encompassing linguistic variation, historical documentation, cultural expressions, and literary analysis. By analyzing technical frameworks, current methodologies, and ethical considerations, this paper identifies key challenges such as data accessibility, model adaptability, and cultural sensitivity. Given the cultural, historical, and linguistic richness inherent in low-resource languages, this work emphasizes interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of customized models as promising avenues for advancing research in this domain. By underscoring the potential of integrating artificial intelligence with the humanities to preserve and study humanity's linguistic and cultural heritage, this study fosters global efforts towards safeguarding intellectual diversity.

<title>PBI-Attack: Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for Toxicity Maximization</title>

Abstract: Understanding the vulnerabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) to jailbreak attacks is essential for their responsible real-world deployment. Most previous work requires access to model gradients, or is based on human knowledge (prompt engineering) to complete jailbreak, and they hardly consider the interaction of images and text, resulting in inability to jailbreak in black box scenarios or poor performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Prior-Guided Bimodal Interactive Black-Box Jailbreak Attack for toxicity maximization, referred to as PBI-Attack. Our method begins by extracting malicious features from a harmful corpus using an alternative LVLM and embedding these features into a benign image as prior information. Subsequently, we enhance these features through bidirectional cross-modal interaction optimization, which iteratively optimizes the bimodal perturbations in an alternating manner through greedy search, aiming to maximize the toxicity of the generated response. The toxicity level is quantified using a well-trained evaluation model. Experiments demonstrate that PBI-Attack outperforms previous state-of-the-art jailbreak methods, achieving an average attack success rate of 92.5% across three open-source LVLMs and around 67.3% on three closed-source LVLMs. Disclaimer: This paper contains potentially disturbing and offensive content.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a well-established problem in Reinforcement Learning (RL), which aims to facilitate rapid RL by leveraging expert demonstrations to pre-train the RL agent. However, the limited availability of expert demonstration data often hinders its ability to effectively aid downstream RL learning. To address this problem, we propose a novel two-stage method dubbed as Skill-enhanced Reinforcement Learning Acceleration (SeRLA). SeRLA introduces a skill-level adversarial Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning model that extracts useful skill prior knowledge by learning from both expert demonstrations and general low-cost demonstrations in the offline prior learning stage. Building on this, it employs a skill-based soft actor-critic algorithm to leverage the acquired priors for efficient training of a skill policy network in the downstream online RL stage. In addition, we propose a simple skill-level data enhancement technique to mitigate data sparsity and further improve both skill prior learning and skill policy training. Experiments across multiple standard RL benchmarks demonstrate that SeRLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in accelerating reinforcement learning on downstream tasks, particularly in the early training phase.

Abstract: LLMs can generate human-like dialogues, yet their ability to simulate early child-adult interactions remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we examined how effectively LLMs can capture the distinctive features of child-caregiver language in interaction, using both static and interactive benchmarking methods. We found that state-of-the-art LLMs like Llama 3 and GPT-4o can approximate child-caregiver dialogues at the word and utterance level, but they struggle to reproduce the child and caregiver's discursive patterns, exaggerate alignment, and fail to reach the level of diversity shown by humans. The broader goal of this work is to initiate the development of a comprehensive benchmark for LLMs in child-oriented applications.

Abstract: Extracting simple mathematical expression from an observational dataset to describe complex natural phenomena is one of the core objectives of artificial intelligence (AI). This field is known as symbolic regression (SR). Traditional SR models are based on genetic programming (GP) or reinforcement learning (RL), facing well-known challenges, such as low efficiency and overfitting. Recent studies have integrated SR with large language models (LLMs), enabling fast zero-shot inference by learning mappings from millions of dataset-expression pairs. However, since the input and output are inherently different modalities, such models often struggle to converge effectively. In this paper, we introduce ViSymRe, a vision-guided multimodal SR model that incorporates the third resource, expression graph, to bridge the modality gap. Different from traditional multimodal models, ViSymRe is trained to extract vision, termed virtual vision, from datasets, without relying on the global availability of expression graphs, which addresses the essential challenge of visual SR, i.e., expression graphs are not available during inference. Evaluation results on multiple mainstream benchmarks show that ViSymRe achieves more competitive performance than the state-of-the-art dataset-only baselines. The expressions predicted by ViSymRe not only fit the dataset well but are also simple and structurally accurate, goals that SR models strive to achieve.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), which store an extensive number of relational facts, serve various applications. Recently, personalized knowledge graphs (PKGs) have emerged as a solution to optimize storage costs by customizing their content to align with users' specific interests within particular domains. In the real world, on one hand, user queries and their underlying interests are inherently evolving, requiring PKGs to adapt continuously; on the other hand, the summarization is constantly expected to be as small as possible in terms of storage cost. However, the existing PKG summarization methods implicitly assume that the user's interests are constant and do not shift. Furthermore, when the size constraint of PKG is extremely small, the existing methods cannot distinguish which facts are more of immediate interest and guarantee the utility of the summarized PKG. To address these limitations, we propose APEX$^2$, a highly scalable PKG summarization framework designed with robust theoretical guarantees to excel in adaptive summarization tasks with extremely small size constraints. To be specific, after constructing an initial PKG, APEX$^2$ continuously tracks the interest shift and adjusts the previous summary. We evaluate APEX$^2$ under an evolving query setting on benchmark KGs containing up to 12 million triples, summarizing with compression ratios $\leq 0.1\%$. The experiments show that APEX outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both query-answering accuracy and efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/iDEA-iSAIL-Lab-UIUC/APEX.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected offline datasets, relaxing the need to interact directly with the environment. However, limited by the quality of offline datasets, it generally fails to learn well-qualified policies in suboptimal datasets. To address datasets with insufficient optimal demonstrations, we introduce Goal-cOnditioned Data Augmentation (GODA), a novel goal-conditioned diffusion-based method for augmenting samples with higher quality. Leveraging recent advancements in generative modelling, GODA incorporates a novel return-oriented goal condition with various selection mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a controllable scaling technique to provide enhanced return-based guidance during data sampling. GODA learns a comprehensive distribution representation of the original offline datasets while generating new data with selectively higher-return goals, thereby maximizing the utility of limited optimal demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a novel adaptive gated conditioning method for processing noisy inputs and conditions, enhancing the capture of goal-oriented guidance. We conduct experiments on the D4RL benchmark and real-world challenges, specifically traffic signal control (TSC) tasks, to demonstrate GODA's effectiveness in enhancing data quality and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art data augmentation methods across various offline RL algorithms.

Abstract: The rapid technical progress of generative art (GenArt) has democratized the creation of visually appealing imagery. However, achieving genuine artistic impact - the kind that resonates with viewers on a deeper, more meaningful level - remains formidable as it requires a sophisticated aesthetic sensibility. This sensibility involves a multifaceted cognitive process extending beyond mere visual appeal, which is often overlooked by current computational methods. This paper pioneers an approach to capture this complex process by investigating how the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) can be effectively elicited to perform aesthetic judgment. Our analysis reveals a critical challenge: MLLMs exhibit a tendency towards hallucinations during aesthetic reasoning, characterized by subjective opinions and unsubstantiated artistic interpretations. We further demonstrate that these hallucinations can be suppressed by employing an evidence-based and objective reasoning process, as substantiated by our proposed baseline, ArtCoT. MLLMs prompted by this principle produce multifaceted, in-depth aesthetic reasoning that aligns significantly better with human judgment. These findings have direct applications in areas such as AI art tutoring and as reward models for image generation. Ultimately, we hope this work paves the way for AI systems that can truly understand, appreciate, and contribute to art that aligns with human aesthetic values.

Abstract: With the widespread use of virtual reality applications, 3D scene generation has become a new challenging research frontier. 3D scenes have highly complex structures and need to ensure that the output is dense, coherent, and contains all necessary structures. Many current 3D scene generation methods rely on pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models and monocular depth estimators. However, the generated scenes occupy large amounts of storage space and often lack effective regularisation methods, leading to geometric distortions. To this end, we propose BloomScene, a lightweight structured 3D Gaussian splatting for crossmodal scene generation, which creates diverse and high-quality 3D scenes from text or image inputs. Specifically, a crossmodal progressive scene generation framework is proposed to generate coherent scenes utilizing incremental point cloud reconstruction and 3D Gaussian splatting. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical depth prior-based regularization mechanism that utilizes multi-level constraints on depth accuracy and smoothness to enhance the realism and continuity of the generated scenes. Ultimately, we propose a structured context-guided compression mechanism that exploits structured hash grids to model the context of unorganized anchor attributes, which significantly eliminates structural redundancy and reduces storage overhead. Comprehensive experiments across multiple scenes demonstrate the significant potential and advantages of our framework compared with several baselines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global model using their local datasets while reinforcing data privacy, but it is prone to poisoning attacks. Existing defense mechanisms assume that clients' data are independent and identically distributed (IID), making them ineffective in real-world applications where data are non-IID. This paper presents FL-CLEANER, the first defense capable of filtering both byzantine and backdoor attackers' model updates in a non-IID FL environment. The originality of FL-CLEANER is twofold. First, it relies on a client confidence score derived from the reconstruction errors of each client's model activation maps for a given trigger set, with reconstruction errors obtained by means of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder trained according to a novel server-side strategy. Second, it uses an original ad-hoc trust propagation algorithm we propose. Based on previous client scores, it allows building a cluster of benign clients while flagging potential attackers. Experimental results on the datasets MNIST and FashionMNIST demonstrate the efficiency of FL-CLEANER against Byzantine attackers as well as to some state-of-the-art backdoors in non-IID scenarios; it achieves a close-to-zero (<1%) benign client misclassification rate, even in the absence of an attack, and achieves strong performance compared to state of the art defenses.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

Abstract: Snapshot Compressed Imaging (SCI) offers high-speed, low-bandwidth, and energy-efficient image acquisition, but remains challenged by low-light and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Moreover, practical hardware constraints in high-resolution sensors limit the use of large frame-sized masks, necessitating smaller, hardware-friendly designs. In this work, we present a novel SCI-based computer vision framework using pseudo-random binary masks of only 8$\times$8 in size for physically feasible implementations. At its core is CompDAE, a Compressive Denoising Autoencoder built on the STFormer architecture, designed to perform downstream tasks--such as edge detection and depth estimation--directly from noisy compressive raw pixel measurements without image reconstruction. CompDAE incorporates a rate-constrained training strategy inspired by BackSlash to promote compact, compressible models. A shared encoder paired with lightweight task-specific decoders enables a unified multi-task platform. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that CompDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower complexity, especially under ultra-low-light conditions where traditional CMOS and SCI pipelines fail.

Abstract: The growing complexity of network traffic and demand for ultra-low latency communication require smarter packet traffic management. Existing Deep Learning-based queuing approaches struggle with dynamic network scenarios and demand high engineering effort. We propose AQM-LLM, distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning, contextual understanding, and pattern recognition to improve Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC 9330] with minimal manual effort. We consider a specific case where AQM is Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and our design of AQM-LLM builds on speculative decoding and reinforcement-based distilling of LLM by tackling congestion prevention in the L4S architecture using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC 9331] and periodic packet dropping. We develop a new open-source experimental platform by executing L4S-AQM on FreeBSD-14, providing interoperable modules to support LLM integration and facilitate IETF recognition through wider testing. Our extensive evaluations show L4S-LLM enhances queue management, prevents congestion, reduces latency, and boosts network performance, showcasing LLMs' adaptability and efficiency in uplifting AQM systems.

Abstract: Continual learning of vision-language models (VLMs) focuses on leveraging cross-modal pretrained knowledge to incrementally adapt to expanding downstream tasks and datasets, while tackling the challenge of knowledge forgetting. Existing research often focuses on connecting visual features with specific class text in downstream tasks, overlooking the latent relationships between general and specialized knowledge. Our findings reveal that forcing models to optimize inappropriate visual-text matches exacerbates forgetting of VLM's recognition ability. To tackle this issue, we propose DesCLIP, which leverages general attribute (GA) descriptions to guide the understanding of specific class objects, enabling VLMs to establish robust vision-GA-class trilateral associations rather than relying solely on vision-class connections. Specifically, we introduce a language assistant to generate concrete GA description candidates via proper request prompts. Then, an anchor-based embedding filter is designed to obtain highly relevant GA description embeddings, which are leveraged as the paired text embeddings for visual-textual instance matching, thereby tuning the visual encoder. Correspondingly, the class text embeddings are gradually calibrated to align with these shared GA description embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancements and efficacy of our proposed method, with comprehensive empirical evaluations highlighting its superior performance in VLM-based recognition compared to existing continual learning methods.

Abstract: Visual reasoning refers to the task of solving questions about visual information. Current visual reasoning methods typically employ pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) strategies or deep neural network approaches. However, existing efforts are constrained by limited reasoning interpretability, while hindering by the phenomenon of underspecification in the question text. Additionally, the absence of fine-grained visual knowledge limits the precise understanding of subject behavior in visual reasoning tasks. To address these issues, we propose VIKSER (Visual Knowledge-Driven Self-Reinforcing Reasoning Framework). Specifically, VIKSER, trained using knowledge distilled from large language models, extracts fine-grained visual knowledge with the assistance of visual relationship detection techniques. Subsequently, VIKSER utilizes fine-grained visual knowledge to paraphrase the question with underspecification. Additionally, we design a novel prompting method called Chain-of-Evidence (CoE), which leverages the power of "evidence for reasoning" to endow VIKSER with interpretable reasoning capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of self-reflection technology empowers VIKSER with the ability to learn and improve from its mistakes. Experiments conducted on widely used datasets demonstrate that VIKSER achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in relevant tasks. Moreover, VIKSER achieves performance on par with leading proprietary models, such as the latest ChatGPT-5.

<title>Token Assorted: Mixing Latent and Text Tokens for Improved Language Model Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reasoning and planning when trained on chainof-thought (CoT) data, where the step-by-step thought process is explicitly outlined by text tokens. However, this results in lengthy inputs where many words support textual coherence rather than core reasoning information, and processing these inputs consumes substantial computation resources. In this work, we propose a hybrid representation of the reasoning process, where we partially abstract away the initial reasoning steps using latent discrete tokens generated by VQ-VAE, significantly reducing the length of reasoning traces. We explore the use of latent trace abstractions in two scenarios: 1) training the model from scratch for the Keys-Finding Maze problem, 2) fine-tuning LLMs on this hybrid data with an extended vocabulary including unseen latent tokens, for both logical and mathematical reasoning problems. To facilitate effective learning, we introduce a simple training procedure that randomly mixes latent and text tokens, which enables fast adaptation to new latent tokens. Our approach consistently outperforms the baselines methods in various benchmarks.

<title>The Complexity of Learning Sparse Superposed Features with Feedback</title>

Abstract: The success of deep networks is crucially attributed to their ability to capture latent features within a representation space. In this work, we investigate whether the underlying learned features of a model can be efficiently retrieved through feedback from an agent, such as a large language model (LLM), in the form of relative \tt{triplet comparisons}. These features may represent various constructs, including dictionaries in LLMs or a covariance matrix of Mahalanobis distances. We analyze the feedback complexity associated with learning a feature matrix in sparse settings. Our results establish tight bounds when the agent is permitted to construct activations and demonstrate strong upper bounds in sparse scenarios when the agent's feedback is limited to distributional information. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on two distinct applications: feature recovery from Recursive Feature Machines and dictionary extraction from sparse autoencoders trained on Large Language Models.

<title>Harnessing Vision Models for Time Series Analysis: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Time series analysis has witnessed the inspiring development from traditional autoregressive models, deep learning models, to recent Transformers and Large Language Models (LLMs). Efforts in leveraging vision models for time series analysis have also been made along the way but are less visible to the community due to the predominant research on sequence modeling in this domain. However, the discrepancy between continuous time series and the discrete token space of LLMs, and the challenges in explicitly modeling the correlations of variates in multivariate time series have shifted some research attentions to the equally successful Large Vision Models (LVMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). To fill the blank in the existing literature, this survey discusses the advantages of vision models over LLMs in time series analysis. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth overview of the existing methods, with dual views of detailed taxonomy that answer the key research questions including how to encode time series as images and how to model the imaged time series for various tasks. Additionally, we address the challenges in the pre- and post-processing steps involved in this framework and outline future directions to further advance time series analysis with vision models.

<title>RAMer: Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Multi-party Multi-modal Multi-label Emotion Recognition</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10435</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2502.10435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional Multi-modal multi-label emotion recognition (MMER) assumes complete access to visual, textual, and acoustic modalities. However, real-world multi-party settings often violate this assumption, as non-speakers frequently lack acoustic and textual inputs, leading to a significant degradation in model performance. Existing approaches also tend to unify heterogeneous modalities into a single representation, overlooking each modality's unique characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose RAMer (Reconstruction-based Adversarial Model for Emotion Recognition), which refines multi-modal representations by not only exploring modality commonality and specificity but crucially by leveraging reconstructed features, enhanced by contrastive learning, to overcome data incompleteness and enrich feature quality. RAMer also introduces a personality auxiliary task to complement missing modalities using modality-level attention, improving emotion reasoning. To further strengthen the model's ability to capture label and modality interdependency, we propose a stack shuffle strategy to enrich correlations between labels and modality-specific features. Experiments on three benchmarks, i.e., MEmoR, CMU-MOSEI, and $M^3ED$, demonstrate that RAMer achieves state-of-the-art performance in dyadic and multi-party MMER scenarios.

<title>NeuroAMP: A Novel End-to-end General Purpose Deep Neural Amplifier for Personalized Hearing Aids</title>

arXiv:2502.10822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of hearing aids is increasing. However, optimizing the amplification processes of hearing aids remains challenging due to the complexity of integrating multiple modular components in traditional methods. To address this challenge, we present NeuroAMP, a novel deep neural network designed for end-to-end, personalized amplification in hearing aids. NeuroAMP leverages both spectral features and the listener's audiogram as inputs, and we investigate four architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), and Transformer. We also introduce Denoising NeuroAMP, an extension that integrates noise reduction along with amplification capabilities for improved performance in real-world scenarios. To enhance generalization, a comprehensive data augmentation strategy was employed during training on diverse speech (TIMIT and TMHINT) and music (Cadenza Challenge MUSIC) datasets. Evaluation using the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI), Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI), and Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) demonstrates that the Transformer architecture within NeuroAMP achieves the best performance, with SRCC scores of 0.9927 (HASQI) and 0.9905 (HASPI) on TIMIT, and 0.9738 (HAAQI) on the Cadenza Challenge MUSIC dataset. Notably, our data augmentation strategy maintains high performance on unseen datasets (e.g., VCTK, MUSDB18-HQ). Furthermore, Denoising NeuroAMP outperforms both the conventional NAL-R+WDRC approach and a two-stage baseline on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in both HASPI (0.90) and HASQI (0.59) scores. These results highlight the potential of NeuroAMP and Denoising NeuroAMP to deliver notable improvements in personalized hearing aid amplification.

arXiv:2502.15779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition. Code is available at https://github.com/ songsm921/RCP.

Abstract: Recent works have characterized the function-space inductive bias of infinite-width bounded-norm single-hidden-layer neural networks as a kind of bounded-variation-type space. This novel neural network Banach space encompasses many classical multivariate function spaces, including certain Sobolev spaces and the spectral Barron spaces. Notably, this Banach space also includes functions that exhibit less classical regularity, such as those that only vary in a few directions. On bounded domains, it is well-established that the Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) strictly embeds into this Banach space, demonstrating a clear gap between the Gaussian RKHS and the neural network Banach space. It turns out that when investigating these spaces on unbounded domains, e.g., all of $\mathbb{R}^d$, the story is fundamentally different. We establish the following fundamental result: Certain functions that lie in the Gaussian RKHS have infinite norm in the neural network Banach space. This provides a nontrivial gap between kernel methods and neural networks by exhibiting functions that kernel methods easily represent, whereas neural networks cannot.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly capable across global languages. However, the ability to communicate across languages does not necessarily translate to appropriate cultural representations. A key concern is US-centric bias, where LLMs reflect US rather than local cultural values. We propose a novel methodology that compares LLM-generated response distributions against population-level opinion data from the World Value Survey across four languages (Danish, Dutch, English, and Portuguese). Using a rigorous linear mixed-effects regression framework, we compare two families of models: Google's Gemma models (2B--27B parameters) and successive iterations of OpenAI's turbo-series. Across the families of models, we find no consistent relationships between language capabilities and cultural alignment. While the Gemma models have a positive correlation between language capability and cultural alignment across languages, the OpenAI models do not. Importantly, we find that self-consistency is a stronger predictor of multicultural alignment than multilingual capabilities. Our results demonstrate that achieving meaningful cultural alignment requires dedicated effort beyond improving general language capabilities.

<title>Automatic Input Rewriting Improves Translation with Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2502.16682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can we improve machine translation (MT) with LLMs by rewriting their inputs automatically? Users commonly rely on the intuition that well-written text is easier to translate when using off-the-shelf MT systems. LLMs can rewrite text in many ways but in the context of MT, these capabilities have been primarily exploited to rewrite outputs via post-editing. We present an empirical study of 21 input rewriting methods with 3 open-weight LLMs for translating from English into 6 target languages. We show that text simplification is the most effective MT-agnostic rewrite strategy and that it can be improved further when using quality estimation to assess translatability. Human evaluation further confirms that simplified rewrites and their MT outputs both largely preserve the original meaning of the source and MT. These results suggest LLM-assisted input rewriting as a promising direction for improving translations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language tasks, yet their performance in dynamic, real-world financial environments remains underexplored. Existing approaches are limited to historical backtesting, where trading actions cannot influence market prices and agents train only on static data. To address this limitation, we present the Agent Trading Arena, a virtual zero-sum stock market in which LLM-based agents engage in competitive multi-agent trading and directly impact price dynamics. By simulating realistic bid-ask interactions, our platform enables training in scenarios that closely mirror live markets, thereby narrowing the gap between training and evaluation. Experiments reveal that LLMs struggle with numerical reasoning when given plain-text data, often overfitting to local patterns and recent values. In contrast, chart-based visualizations significantly enhance both numerical reasoning and trading performance. Furthermore, incorporating a reflection module yields additional improvements, especially with visual inputs. Evaluations on NASDAQ and CSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, particularly under high volatility. All code and data are available at https://github.com/wekjsdvnm/Agent-Trading-Arena.

arXiv:2502.18517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) has attracted many individuals to fine-tune them for domain-specific tasks by uploading their data. However, in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, privacy concerns often arise. One promising solution is to generate synthetic data with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees to replace private data. However, these synthetic data contain significant flawed data, which are considered as noise. Existing solutions typically rely on naive filtering by comparing ROUGE-L scores or embedding similarities, which are ineffective in addressing the noise. To address this issue, we propose \textit{RewardDS}, a novel privacy-preserving framework that fine-tunes a reward proxy model and uses reward signals to guide the synthetic data generation. Our \textit{RewardDS} introduces two key modules, Reward Guided Filtering and Self-Optimizing Refinement, to both filter and refine the synthetic data, effectively mitigating the noise. Extensive experiments across medical, financial, and code generation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

arXiv:2502.18848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer natural language explanations as an alternative to feature attribution methods for model interpretability. However, despite their plausibility, they may not reflect the model's true reasoning faithfully, which is crucial for understanding the model's true decision-making processes. Although several faithfulness metrics have been proposed, they are often evaluated in isolation, making direct, principled comparisons between them difficult. Here, we present Causal Diagnosticity, a framework that serves as a common testbed to evaluate faithfulness metrics for natural language explanations. Our framework employs the concept of diagnosticity, and uses model-editing methods to generate faithful-unfaithful explanation pairs. Our benchmark includes four tasks: fact-checking, analogy, object counting, and multi-hop reasoning. We evaluate prominent faithfulness metrics, including post-hoc explanation and chain-of-thought-based methods. We find that diagnostic performance varies across tasks and models, with Filler Tokens performing best overall. Additionally, continuous metrics are generally more diagnostic than binary ones but can be sensitive to noise and model choice. Our results highlight the need for more robust faithfulness metrics.

Abstract: Learning generalizable robot manipulation policies, especially for complex multi-fingered humanoids, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches primarily rely on extensive data collection and imitation learning, which are expensive, labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. Sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative, but has mostly succeeded in simpler state-based or single-hand setups. How to effectively extend this to vision-based, contact-rich bimanual manipulation tasks remains an open question. In this paper, we introduce a practical sim-to-real RL recipe that trains a humanoid robot to perform three challenging dexterous manipulation tasks: grasp-and-reach, box lift and bimanual handover. Our method features an automated real-to-sim tuning module, a generalized reward formulation based on contact and object goals, a divide-and-conquer policy distillation framework, and a hybrid object representation strategy with modality-specific augmentation. We demonstrate high success rates on unseen objects and robust, adaptive policy behaviors -- highlighting that vision-based dexterous manipulation via sim-to-real RL is not only viable, but also scalable and broadly applicable to real-world humanoid manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Practical control systems pose significant challenges in identifying optimal control policies due to uncertainties in the system model and external disturbances. While $H_\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design robust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods often require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called Robust Deterministic Policy Gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\infty$ control problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one player (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the adversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient (DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control policy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical implementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic policy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and integrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with following a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other control approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling precise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance conditions.

Abstract: E-commerce search optimization has evolved to include a wider range of metrics that reflect user engagement and business objectives. Modern search frameworks now incorporate advanced quality features, such as sales counts and document-query relevance, to better align search results with these goals. Traditional methods typically focus on click-through rate (CTR) as a measure of engagement or relevance, but this can miss true purchase intent, creating a gap between user interest and actual conversions. Joint training with the click-through conversion rate (CTCVR) has become essential for understanding buying behavior, although its sparsity poses challenges for reliable optimization. This study presents MOHPER, a Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization framework for E-commerce Retrieval systems. Utilizing Bayesian optimization and sampling, it jointly optimizes both CTR, CTCVR, and relevant objectives, focusing on engagement and conversion of the users. In addition, to improve the selection of the best configuration from multi-objective optimization, we suggest advanced methods for hyperparameter selection, including a meta-configuration voting strategy and a cumulative training approach that leverages prior optimal configurations, to improve speeds of training and efficiency. Currently deployed in a live setting, our proposed framework substantiates its practical efficacy in achieving a balanced optimization that aligns with both user satisfaction and revenue goals.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on targeted datasets enhances task-specific performance but often comes at the expense of generalization. Model merging techniques, which integrate multiple fine-tuned models into a single multi-task model through task arithmetic, offer a promising solution. However, task interference remains a fundamental challenge, leading to performance degradation and suboptimal merged models. Existing approaches largely overlooked the fundamental roles of neurons, their connectivity, and activation, resulting in a merging process and a merged model that does not consider how neurons relay and process information. In this work, we present the first study that relies on neuronal mechanisms for model merging. Specifically, we decomposed task-specific representations into two complementary neuronal subspaces that regulate input sensitivity and task adaptability. Leveraging this decomposition, we introduced NeuroMerging, a novel merging framework developed to mitigate task interference within neuronal subspaces, enabling training-free model fusion across diverse tasks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that NeuroMerging achieved superior performance compared to existing methods on multi-task benchmarks across both natural language and vision domains. Our findings highlighted the importance of aligning neuronal mechanisms in model merging, offering new insights into mitigating task interference and improving knowledge fusion.

Abstract: Learning skills in open-world environments is essential for developing agents capable of handling a variety of tasks by combining basic skills. Online demonstration videos are typically long but unsegmented, making them difficult to segment and label with skill identifiers. Unlike existing methods that rely on sequence sampling or human labeling, we have developed a self-supervised learning-based approach to segment these long videos into a series of semantic-aware and skill-consistent segments. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive event segmentation theory, we introduce Skill Boundary Detection (SBD), an annotation-free temporal video segmentation algorithm. SBD detects skill boundaries in a video by leveraging prediction errors from a pretrained unconditional action-prediction model. This approach is based on the assumption that a significant increase in prediction error indicates a shift in the skill being executed. We evaluated our method in Minecraft, a rich open-world simulator with extensive gameplay videos available online. Our SBD-generated segments improved the average performance of conditioned policies by 63.7% and 52.1% on short-term atomic skill tasks, and their corresponding hierarchical agents by 11.3% and 20.8% on long-horizon tasks. Our method can leverage the diverse YouTube videos to train instruction-following agents. The project page can be found in https://craftjarvis.github.io/SkillDiscovery.

Abstract: Advanced table question answering (TableQA) methods prompt large language models (LLMs) to generate answer text, SQL query, Python code, or custom operation, which impressively improve the complex reasoning problems in the TableQA task. However, these methods lack the versatility to cope with specific question types or table structures. In contrast, the Spreadsheet Formula, the widely used and well-defined operation language for tabular data, has not been thoroughly explored to solve TableQA. In this paper, we first attempt to use the Formula as the executable representation for solving complex reasoning on tables with different structures. Specifically, we construct \texttt{FromulaQA}, a large Formula-annotated TableQA dataset from existing datasets. In addition, we propose \texttt{TabAF}, a general table answering framework to solve multiple types of tasks over multiple types of tables simultaneously, which decodes answers and Formulas with a single LLM backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate the versatility and generalization of \texttt{TabAF}. Under the same model size, \texttt{TabAF} achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the WikiTableQuestion, HiTab, and TabFact.

Abstract: Misleading visualizations, which manipulate chart representations to support specific claims, can distort perception and lead to incorrect conclusions. Despite decades of research, they remain a widespread issue-posing risks to public understanding and raising safety concerns for AI systems involved in data-driven communication. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong chart comprehension abilities, their capacity to detect and interpret misleading charts remains unexplored. We introduce Misleading ChartQA benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to evaluate MLLMs on misleading chart reasoning. It contains 3,026 curated examples spanning 21 misleader types and 10 chart types, each with standardized chart code, CSV data, multiple-choice questions, and labeled explanations, validated through iterative MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs, analyze their performance across misleader types and chart formats, and propose a novel region-aware reasoning pipeline that enhances model accuracy. Our work lays the foundation for developing MLLMs that are robust, trustworthy, and aligned with the demands of responsible visual communication.

Abstract: Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer. Its accuracy heavily depends on expert radiologists, making it essential to minimize interpretation errors. To support radiologists, various computer-aided detection and diagnostic methods have been proposed, increasingly leveraging advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. Over recent years, mammogram analysis has evolved significantly - from early patch-based classifiers, which examine only localized regions of images, to full-image classifiers, and later towards multi-view systems that simultaneously integrate multiple perspectives of the mammographic exam for enhanced accuracy. Despite this progression, critical questions remain, such as whether multi-view systems consistently outperform single-view approaches. In this paper, we systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of single-view and multi-view mammogram classification techniques. Our research introduces models that achieve superior performance relative to existing state-of-the-art approaches in both single-view and two-view classification scenarios. Furthermore, our findings provide valuable insights into optimal model architectures and effective transfer learning strategies, paving the way for more accurate and efficient mammogram interpretation. The inference code and model are available at https://github.com/dpetrini/multiple-view.

<title>Flip Learning: Weakly Supervised Erase to Segment Nodules in Breast Ultrasound</title>

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of nodules in both 2D breast ultrasound (BUS) and 3D automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. Therefore, developing an automated system for nodule segmentation can enhance user independence and expedite clinical analysis. Unlike fully-supervised learning, weakly-supervised segmentation (WSS) can streamline the laborious and intricate annotation process. However, current WSS methods face challenges in achieving precise nodule segmentation, as many of them depend on inaccurate activation maps or inefficient pseudo-mask generation algorithms. In this study, we introduce a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning-based WSS framework called Flip Learning, which relies solely on 2D/3D boxes for accurate segmentation. Specifically, multiple agents are employed to erase the target from the box to facilitate classification tag flipping, with the erased region serving as the predicted segmentation mask. The key contributions of this research are as follows: (1) Adoption of a superpixel/supervoxel-based approach to encode the standardized environment, capturing boundary priors and expediting the learning process. (2) Introduction of three meticulously designed rewards, comprising a classification score reward and two intensity distribution rewards, to steer the agents' erasing process precisely, thereby avoiding both under- and over-segmentation. (3) Implementation of a progressive curriculum learning strategy to enable agents to interact with the environment in a progressively challenging manner, thereby enhancing learning efficiency. Extensively validated on the large in-house BUS and ABUS datasets, our Flip Learning method outperforms state-of-the-art WSS methods and foundation models, and achieves comparable performance as fully-supervised learning algorithms.

Abstract: Physical agility is a necessary skill in competitive table tennis, but by no means sufficient. Champions excel in this fast-paced and highly dynamic environment by anticipating their opponent's intent - buying themselves the necessary time to react. In this work, we take one step towards designing such an anticipatory agent. Previous works have developed systems capable of real-time table tennis gameplay, though they often do not leverage anticipation. Among the works that forecast opponent actions, their approaches are limited by dataset size and variety. Our paper contributes (1) a scalable system for reconstructing monocular video of table tennis matches in 3D and (2) an uncertainty-aware controller that anticipates opponent actions. We demonstrate in simulation that our policy improves the ball return rate against high-speed hits from 49.9% to 59.0% as compared to a baseline non-anticipatory policy.

Abstract: We introduce the Entropy Driven Uncertainty Process Reward Model (EDU-PRM), a novel entropy-driven training framework for process reward modeling that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aligned segmentation of complex reasoning steps, eliminating the need for costly manual step annotations. Unlike previous Process Reward Models (PRMs) that rely on static partitioning and human labeling, EDU-PRM automatically anchors step boundaries at tokens with high predictive entropy. On the MATH test set, EDU-PRM achieves 65.5% accuracy, surpassing strong public PRM baselines such as Math-Shepherd PRM (61.7%) and Omega PRM (62.4%) under the High Temperature (HT) Sample + BON setting. Furthermore, when replacing HT sampling with EDU sampling, EDU-PRM further improves both accuracy and efficiency: at N=64, accuracy increases from 64.7% (HT Sample + BON) to 67.3% (EDU Sample + BON), while the number of generated tokens is reduced by 47%, demonstrating a superior accuracy-cost balance. On the ProcessBench test set, EDU-PRM achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.4% using less than 1.5% of the Qwen2.5-Math-PRM-72B training data, surpassing the previous best of 87.8%. In summary, EDU-PRM provides a scalable and annotation-efficient paradigm for process supervision in mathematical reasoning, opening new avenues for efficient complex reasoning on math.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable outcomes in complex problems, including math, coding, and analyzing large amounts of scientific reports. Yet, few works have explored the potential of LLMs in quantum computing. The most challenging problem is to leverage LLMs to automatically generate quantum circuits at a large scale. Fundamentally, the existing pre-trained LLMs lack the knowledge of quantum circuits. In this paper, we address this challenge by fine-tuning LLMs and injecting the domain-specific knowledge of quantum computing. We describe Agent-Q, an LLM fine-tuning system to generate and optimize quantum circuits. In particular, Agent-Q implements the mechanisms to generate training data sets and constructs an end-to-end pipeline to fine-tune pre-trained LLMs to generate parameterized quantum circuits for various optimization problems. Agent-Q provides 14,000 quantum circuits covering a large spectrum of the quantum optimization landscape: 12 optimization problem instances and their optimized QAOA, VQE, and adaptive VQE circuits. Based thereon, Agent-Q fine-tunes LLMs and constructs syntactically correct parametrized quantum circuits in OpenQASM 3.0. We have evaluated the quality of the LLM-generated circuits and parameters by comparing them to the optimized expectation values and distributions. Experimental results show superior performance of Agent-Q, compared to several state-of-the-art LLMs and better parameters than random. Agent-Q can be integrated into an agentic workflow, and the generated parametrized circuits with initial parameters can be used as a starting point for further optimization, e.g., as templates in quantum machine learning and as benchmarks for compilers and hardware.

<title>A Rollout-Based Algorithm and Reward Function for Resource Allocation in Business Processes</title>

Abstract: Resource allocation plays a critical role in minimizing cycle time and improving the efficiency of business processes. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful technique to optimize resource allocation policies in business processes. In the DRL framework, an agent learns a policy through interaction with the environment, guided solely by reward signals that indicate the quality of its decisions. However, existing algorithms are not suitable for dynamic environments such as business processes. Furthermore, existing DRL-based methods rely on engineered reward functions that approximate the desired objective, but a misalignment between reward and objective can lead to undesired decisions or suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose a rollout-based DRL algorithm and a reward function to optimize the objective directly. Our algorithm iteratively improves the policy by evaluating execution trajectories following different actions. Our reward function directly decomposes the objective function of minimizing the cycle time, such that trial-and-error reward engineering becomes unnecessary. We evaluated our method in six scenarios, for which the optimal policy can be computed, and on a set of increasingly complex, realistically sized process models. The results show that our algorithm can learn the optimal policy for the scenarios and outperform or match the best heuristics on the realistically sized business processes.

Abstract: LLM agents utilize Large Language Models as central components with diverse tools to complete various user tasks, but face significant security risks when interacting with external environments. Attackers can exploit these agents through various vectors, including indirect prompt injection, memory/knowledge base poisoning, and malicious tools, tricking agents into performing dangerous actions such as unauthorized financial transactions or data leakage. The core problem that enables attacks to succeed lies in over-privileged tool access. We introduce Progent, the first privilege control framework to secure LLM agents. Progent enforces security at the tool level by restricting agents to performing tool calls necessary for user tasks while blocking potentially malicious ones. Progent features a domain-specific language that allows for expressing fine-grained policies for controlling tool privileges, flexible fallback actions when calls are blocked, and dynamic policy updates to adapt to changing agent states. The framework operates deterministically at runtime, providing provable security guarantees. Thanks to our modular design, integrating Progent does not alter agent internals and only requires minimal changes to the existing agent implementation, enhancing its practicality and potential for widespread adoption. Our extensive evaluation across various agent use cases, using benchmarks like AgentDojo, ASB, and AgentPoison, demonstrates that Progent reduces attack success rates to 0%, while preserving agent utility and speed. Additionally, we show that LLMs can automatically generate effective policies, highlighting their potential for automating the process of writing Progent's security policies.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications, yet it demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance because of high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, that are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce Tilus, a domain-specific language designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing that supports low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths from 1 to 8 while maintaining GPU programmability. Tilus features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. Tilus programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs through automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tilus efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels. Compared to existing compilers such as Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, Tilus achieves performance improvements of: $1.75\times$, $2.61\times$, $1.29\times$ and $1.03\times$, respectively. We open-source Tilus at https://github.com/NVIDIA/tilus.

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in research and development on open-source and cost-efficient large-language models (LLMs), serving scalability remains a critical challenge, particularly for small organizations and individuals seeking to deploy and test their LLM innovations. Inspired by peer-to-peer networks that leverage decentralized overlay nodes to increase throughput and availability, we propose GenTorrent, an LLM serving overlay that harnesses computing resources from decentralized contributors. We identify four key research problems inherent to enabling such a decentralized infrastructure: 1) overlay network organization; 2) LLM communication privacy; 3) overlay forwarding for resource efficiency; and 4) verification of serving quality. This work presents the first systematic study of these fundamental problems in the context of decentralized LLM serving. Evaluation results from a prototype implemented on a set of decentralized nodes demonstrate that GenTorrent achieves a latency reduction of over 50% compared to the baseline design without overlay forwarding. Furthermore, the security features introduce minimal overhead to serving latency and throughput. We believe this work pioneers a new direction for democratizing and scaling future AI serving capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate extraction of key information from 2D engineering drawings is crucial for high-precision manufacturing. Manual extraction is time-consuming and error-prone, while traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques often struggle with complex layouts and overlapping symbols, resulting in unstructured outputs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning framework for structured information extraction by integrating an oriented bounding box (OBB) detection model with a transformer-based document parsing model (Donut). An in-house annotated dataset is used to train YOLOv11 for detecting nine key categories: Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T), General Tolerances, Measures, Materials, Notes, Radii, Surface Roughness, Threads, and Title Blocks. Detected OBBs are cropped into images and labeled to fine-tune Donut for structured JSON output. Fine-tuning strategies include a single model trained across all categories and category-specific models. Results show that the single model consistently outperforms category-specific ones across all evaluation metrics, achieving higher precision (94.77% for GD&amp;T), recall (100% for most), and F1 score (97.3%), while reducing hallucination (5.23%). The proposed framework improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and supports scalable deployment in precision-driven industries.

arXiv:2505.02433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose FairPO, a novel framework designed to promote fairness in multi-label classification by directly optimizing preference signals with a group robustness perspective. In our framework, the set of labels is partitioned into privileged and non-privileged groups, and a preference-based loss inspired by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is employed to more effectively differentiate true positive labels from confusing negatives within the privileged group, while preserving baseline classification performance for non-privileged labels. By framing the learning problem as a robust optimization over groups, our approach dynamically adjusts the training emphasis toward groups with poorer performance, thereby mitigating bias and ensuring a fairer treatment across diverse label categories. In addition, we outline plans to extend this approach by investigating alternative loss formulations such as Simple Preference Optimisation (SimPO) and Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO) to exploit reference-free reward formulations and contrastive training signals. Furthermore, we plan to extend FairPO with multilabel generation capabilities, enabling the model to dynamically generate diverse and coherent label sets for ambiguous inputs.

arXiv:2505.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse observations and coarse-resolution climate models limit effective regional decision-making, underscoring the need for robust downscaling. However, existing AI methods struggle with generalization across variables and geographies and are constrained by the quadratic complexity of Vision Transformer (ViT) self-attention. We introduce ORBIT-2, a scalable foundation model for global, hyper-resolution climate downscaling. ORBIT-2 incorporates two key innovations: (1) Residual Slim ViT (Reslim), a lightweight architecture with residual learning and Bayesian regularization for efficient, robust prediction; and (2) TILES, a tile-wise sequence scaling algorithm that reduces self-attention complexity from quadratic to linear, enabling long-sequence processing and massive parallelism. ORBIT-2 scales to 10 billion parameters across 65,536 GPUs, achieving up to 4.1 exaFLOPS sustained throughput and 74--98% strong scaling efficiency. It supports downscaling to 0.9 km global resolution and processes sequences up to 4.2 billion tokens. On 7 km resolution benchmarks, ORBIT-2 achieves high accuracy with $R^2$ scores in the range of 0.98--0.99 against observational data.

<title>Mask-PINNs: Mitigating Internal Covariate Shift in Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.06331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws directly into the loss function. However, as a fundamental optimization issue, internal covariate shift (ICS) hinders the stable and effective training of PINNs by disrupting feature distributions and limiting model expressiveness. Unlike standard deep learning tasks, conventional remedies for ICS -- such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization -- are not directly applicable to PINNs, as they distort the physical consistency required for reliable PDE solutions. To address this issue, we propose Mask-PINNs, a novel architecture that introduces a learnable mask function to regulate feature distributions while preserving the underlying physical constraints of PINNs. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the mask suppresses the expansion of feature representations through a carefully designed modulation mechanism. Empirically, we validate the method on multiple PDE benchmarks -- including convection, wave propagation, and Helmholtz equations -- across diverse activation functions. Our results show consistent improvements in prediction accuracy, convergence stability, and robustness. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mask-PINNs enable the effective use of wider networks, overcoming a key limitation in existing PINN frameworks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence and robotics due to their commonsense reasoning capabilities. In robotic manipulation, VLMs are used primarily as high-level planners, but recent work has also studied their lower-level reasoning ability, which refers to making decisions about precise robot movements. However, the community currently lacks a clear and common benchmark that can evaluate how well VLMs can aid low-level reasoning in robotics. Consequently, we propose a novel benchmark, ManipBench, to evaluate the low-level robot manipulation reasoning capabilities of VLMs across various dimensions, including how well they understand object-object interactions and deformable object manipulation. We extensively test 33 representative VLMs across 10 model families on our benchmark, including variants to test different model sizes. Our evaluation shows that the performance of VLMs significantly varies across tasks, and there is a strong correlation between this performance and trends in our real-world manipulation tasks. It also shows that there remains a significant gap between these models and human-level understanding. See our website at: https://manipbench.github.io.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities but are inherently limited by their knowledge reservoir. Retrieval-augmented reasoning mitigates this limitation by allowing LLMs to query external resources, but existing methods often retrieve irrelevant or noisy information, hindering accurate reasoning. In this paper, we propose AutoRefine, a reinforcement learning post-training framework that adopts a new ``search-and-refine-during-think'' paradigm. AutoRefine introduces explicit knowledge refinement steps between successive search calls, enabling the model to iteratively filter, distill, and organize evidence before generating an answer. Furthermore, we incorporate tailored retrieval-specific rewards alongside answer correctness rewards using group relative policy optimization. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that AutoRefine significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex, multi-hop reasoning scenarios. Detailed analysis shows that AutoRefine issues frequent, higher-quality searches and synthesizes evidence effectively.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have shown improved performance in generating accurate responses. However, the dependence on external knowledge bases introduces potential security vulnerabilities, particularly when these knowledge bases are publicly accessible and modifiable. While previous studies have exposed knowledge poisoning risks in RAG systems, existing attack methods suffer from critical limitations: they either require injecting multiple poisoned documents (resulting in poor stealthiness) or can only function effectively on simplistic queries (limiting real-world applicability). This paper reveals a more realistic knowledge poisoning attack against RAG systems that achieves successful attacks by poisoning only a single document while remaining effective for complex multi-hop questions involving complex relationships between multiple elements. Our proposed AuthChain address three challenges to ensure the poisoned documents are reliably retrieved and trusted by the LLM, even against large knowledge bases and LLM's own knowledge. Extensive experiments across six popular LLMs demonstrate that AuthChain achieves significantly higher attack success rates while maintaining superior stealthiness against RAG defense mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity into visual representations is a fundamental challenge at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. While EEG visual decoding has shown promise due to its non-invasive, and low-cost nature, existing methods suffer from Hierarchical Neural Encoding Neglect (HNEN)-a critical limitation where flat neural representations fail to model the brain's hierarchical visual processing hierarchy. Inspired by the hierarchical organization of visual cortex, we propose ViEEG, a neuro-We further adopt hierarchical contrastive learning for EEG-CLIP representation alignment, enabling zero-shot object recognition. Extensive experiments on the THINGS-EEG dataset demonstrate that ViEEG significantly outperforms previous methods by a large margin in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings. Results on the THINGS-MEG dataset further confirm ViEEG's generalization to different neural modalities. Our framework not only advances the performance frontier but also sets a new paradigm for EEG brain decoding. inspired framework that addresses HNEN. ViEEG decomposes each visual stimulus into three biologically aligned components-contour, foreground object, and contextual scene-serving as anchors for a three-stream EEG encoder. These EEG features are progressively integrated via cross-attention routing, simulating cortical information flow from low-level to high-level vision.

Abstract: Reconstructing natural images from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains a core challenge in natural decoding due to the mismatch between the richness of visual stimuli and the noisy, low resolution nature of fMRI signals. While recent two-stage models, combining deep variational autoencoders (VAEs) with diffusion models, have advanced this task, they treat all spatial-frequency components of the input equally. This uniform treatment forces the model to extract meaning features and suppress irrelevant noise simultaneously, limiting its effectiveness. We introduce FreqSelect, a lightweight, adaptive module that selectively filters spatial-frequency bands before encoding. By dynamically emphasizing frequencies that are most predictive of brain activity and suppressing those that are uninformative, FreqSelect acts as a content-aware gate between image features and natural data. It integrates seamlessly into standard very deep VAE-diffusion pipelines and requires no additional supervision. Evaluated on the Natural Scenes dataset, FreqSelect consistently improves reconstruction quality across both low- and high-level metrics. Beyond performance gains, the learned frequency-selection patterns offer interpretable insights into how different visual frequencies are represented in the brain. Our method generalizes across subjects and scenes, and holds promise for extension to other neuroimaging modalities, offering a principled approach to enhancing both decoding accuracy and neuroscientific interpretability.

Abstract: Achieving coordinated teamwork among legged robots requires both fine-grained locomotion control and long-horizon strategic decision-making. Robot soccer offers a compelling testbed for this challenge, combining dynamic, competitive, and multi-agent interactions. In this work, we present a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that enables fully autonomous and decentralized quadruped robot soccer. First, a set of highly dynamic low-level skills is trained for legged locomotion and ball manipulation, such as walking, dribbling, and kicking. On top of these, a high-level strategic planning policy is trained with Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) via Fictitious Self-Play (FSP). This learning framework allows agents to adapt to diverse opponent strategies and gives rise to sophisticated team behaviors, including coordinated passing, interception, and dynamic role allocation. With an extensive ablation study, the proposed learning method shows significant advantages in the cooperative and competitive multi-agent soccer game. We deploy the learned policies to real quadruped robots relying solely on onboard proprioception and decentralized localization, with the resulting system supporting autonomous robot-robot and robot-human soccer matches on indoor and outdoor soccer courts.

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture (e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges, we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and (3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance, achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to 75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

<title>From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning</title>

Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more human-aligned conceptual representations.

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems (VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction, and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

<title>How Can I Publish My LLM Benchmark Without Giving the True Answers Away?</title>

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries. To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training methodologies.

<title>The challenge of hidden gifts in multi-agent reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These "hidden gifts" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a "hidden gift". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of "hidden gifts", and demonstrate that learning awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently motivated great success in many generation tasks like object removal. Nevertheless, existing image decomposition methods struggle to disentangle semi-transparent or transparent layer occlusions due to mask prior dependencies, static object assumptions, and the lack of datasets. In this paper, we delve into a novel task: Layer-Wise Decomposition of Alpha-Composited Images, aiming to recover constituent layers from single overlapped images under the condition of semi-transparent/transparent alpha layer non-linear occlusion. To address challenges in layer ambiguity, generalization, and data scarcity, we first introduce AlphaBlend, the first large-scale and high-quality dataset for transparent and semi-transparent layer decomposition, supporting six real-world subtasks (e.g., translucent flare removal, semi-transparent cell decomposition, glassware decomposition). Building on this dataset, we present DiffDecompose, a diffusion Transformer-based framework that learns the posterior over possible layer decompositions conditioned on the input image, semantic prompts, and blending type. Rather than regressing alpha mattes directly, DiffDecompose performs In-Context Decomposition, enabling the model to predict one or multiple layers without per-layer supervision, and introduces Layer Position Encoding Cloning to maintain pixel-level correspondence across layers. Extensive experiments on the proposed AlphaBlend dataset and public LOGO dataset verify the effectiveness of DiffDecompose. The code and dataset will be available upon paper acceptance. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Wangzt1121/DiffDecompose.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been remarkably successful at synthesizing novel views of 3D scenes by optimizing a volumetric scene function. This scene function models how optical rays bring color information from a 3D object to the camera pixels. Radio frequency (RF) or audio signals can also be viewed as a vehicle for delivering information about the environment to a sensor. However, unlike camera pixels, an RF/audio sensor receives a mixture of signals that contain many environmental reflections (also called "multipath"). Is it still possible to infer the environment using such multipath signals? We show that with redesign, NeRFs can be taught to learn from multipath signals, and thereby "see" the environment. As a grounding application, we aim to infer the indoor floorplan of a home from sparse WiFi measurements made at multiple locations inside the home. Although a difficult inverse problem, our implicitly learnt floorplans look promising, and enables forward applications, such as indoor signal prediction and basic ray tracing.

Abstract: This study illustrates how incorporating feedback-oriented annotations into the scoring pipeline can enhance the accuracy of automated essay scoring (AES). This approach is demonstrated with the Persuasive Essays for Rating, Selecting, and Understanding Argumentative and Discourse Elements (PERSUADE) corpus. We integrate two types of feedback-driven annotations: those that identify spelling and grammatical errors, and those that highlight argumentative components. To illustrate how this method could be applied in real-world scenarios, we employ two LLMs to generate annotations -- a generative language model used for spell correction and an encoder-based token-classifier trained to identify and mark argumentative elements. By incorporating annotations into the scoring process, we demonstrate improvements in performance using encoder-based large language models fine-tuned as classifiers.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs (and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably, multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using (1) error highlights and (2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps users compare MT inputs and outputs through (3) backtranslation and (4) question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

Abstract: Here we present a versatile foundation model that can perform a range of clinically-relevant image analysis tasks, including segmentation, landmark localisation, diagnosis, and prognostication. A multi-view convolution-transformer masked autoencoder, named as CineMA, was trained on 15 million cine images from 74,916 subjects. The model was validated on multiple image analysis tasks and compared to existing models on >4,500 images from eight independent datasets with diverse population characteristics, representing the largest benchmark study for cine CMR so far. CineMA consistently outperformed conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in delineating ventricular boundaries and estimating ejection fraction, a key measure of cardiac function. The improved performance was preserved, even when the model only used half of fine-tuning data. CineMA also surpassed CNNs in disease detection and matched their performance in long-axis function measurement. Interestingly, we found that CineMA can also detect cardiac changes in systemic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension and cancer, and can also predict mortality. Finally, we assessed model fairness and demonstrated consistent model performance across demographic subgroups. These findings highlight CineMA's accuracy, learning efficiency, adaptability, and fairness, underscoring its potential as a foundation model for automated cardiac image analysis to support clinical workflow and cardiovascular research. All training and inference code and models are made publicly available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA.

Abstract: The move-acceptance hyper-heuristic was recently shown to be able to leave local optima with astonishing efficiency (Lissovoi et al., Artificial Intelligence (2023)). In this work, we propose two modifications to this algorithm that demonstrate impressive performances on a large class of benchmarks including the classic Cliff$_d$ and Jump$_m$ function classes. (i) Instead of randomly choosing between the only-improving and any-move acceptance operator, we take this choice via a simple two-state Markov chain. This modification alone reduces the runtime on Jump$_m$ functions with gap parameter $m$ from $\Omega(n^{2m-1})$ to $O(n^{m+1})$. (ii) We then replace the all-moves acceptance operator with the operator that only accepts worsenings. Such a, counter-intuitive, operator has not been used before in the literature. However, our proofs show that our only-worsening operator can greatly help in leaving local optima, reducing, e.g., the runtime on Jump functions to $O(n^3 \log n)$ independent of the gap size. In general, we prove a remarkably good runtime of $O(n^{k+1} \log n)$ for our Markov move-acceptance hyper-heuristic on all members of a new benchmark class SEQOPT$_k$, which contains a large number of functions having $k$ successive local optima, and which contains the commonly studied Jump$_m$ and Cliff$_d$ functions for $k=2$.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has seen rapid progress in natural image domains, but its adaptation to medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation. Clinically, such editing holds promise for simulating surgical outcomes, creating personalized teaching materials, and enhancing patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating text-guided medical image editing. It consists of 1,182 clinically sourced image-prompt triplets spanning 70 tasks across 13 anatomical regions. MedEBench offers three key contributions: (1) a clinically relevant evaluation framework covering Editing Accuracy, Contextual Preservation, and Visual Quality, supported by detailed descriptions of expected change and ROI (Region of Interest) masks; (2) a systematic comparison of seven state-of-the-art models, revealing common failure patterns; and (3) a failure analysis protocol based on attention grounding, using IoU between attention maps and ROIs to identify mislocalization. MedEBench provides a solid foundation for developing and evaluating reliable, clinically meaningful medical image editing systems. Project website: https://mliuby.github.io/MedEBench_Website/

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various professional domains, with their performance typically evaluated through standardized benchmarks. In the financial field, the stringent demands for professional accuracy and real-time data processing often necessitate the use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. However, the development of financial RAG benchmarks has been constrained by data confidentiality issues and the lack of dynamic data integration. To address this issue, we introduce FinS-Pilot, a novel benchmark for evaluating RAG systems in online financial applications. Constructed from real-world financial assistant interactions, our benchmark incorporates both real-time API data and text data, organized through an intent classification framework covering critical financial domains. The benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation of financial assistants' capabilities in handling both static knowledge and time-sensitive market information.Through systematic experiments with multiple Chinese leading LLMs, we demonstrate FinS-Pilot's effectiveness in identifying models suitable for financial applications while addressing the current gap in specialized evaluation tools for the financial domain. Our work contributes both a practical evaluation framework and a curated dataset to advance research in financial NLP systems. The code and dataset are accessible on GitHub.

Abstract: An evaluator is trustworthy when there exists some agreed-upon way to measure its performance as a labeller. The two ways to establish trustworthiness are either by testing it, or by assuming the evaluator `knows' somehow the way to label the corpus. However, if labelled references (e.g., a development set) are unavailable, neither of these approaches work: the former requires the data, and the latter is an assumption, not evidence. To address this, we introduce an algorithm (the `No-Data Algorithm') by which to establish trust in an evaluator without any existing references. Our algorithm works by successively posing challenges to said evaluator. We show that this is sufficient to establish trustworthiness w.h.p., in such a way that when the evaluator actually knows the way to label the corpus, the No-Data Algorithm accepts its output; and, conversely, flags untrustworthy evaluators when these are unable to prove it. We present formal proofs of correctness, empirical tests, and applications to LLMs-as-judges on low-resource languages.

Abstract: Using the best Text-to-SQL methods in resource-constrained environments is challenging due to their reliance on resource-intensive open-source models. This paper introduces Auto Prompt SQL(AP-SQL), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between resource-efficient small open-source models and the powerful capabilities of large closed-source models for Text-to-SQL translation. Our method decomposes the task into schema filtering, retrieval-augmented text-to-SQL generation based on in-context examples, and prompt-driven schema linking and SQL generation. To improve schema selection accuracy, we fine-tune large language models. Crucially, we also explore the impact of prompt engineering throughout the process, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and Graph-of-Thought(GoT) templates to significantly enhance the model's reasoning for accurate SQL generation. Comprehensive evaluations on the Spider benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of AP-SQL.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https://github.com/llmeval/LLMEval-Med.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations, particularly in the field of computer vision. However, its application to dependent data, such as temporal and spatio-temporal domains, remains underexplored. Besides, traditional contrastive SSL methods often assume \emph{semantic independence between samples}, which does not hold for dependent data exhibiting complex correlations. We propose a novel theoretical framework for contrastive SSL tailored to \emph{continuous dependent data}, which allows the nearest samples to be semantically close to each other. In particular, we propose two possible \textit{ground truth similarity measures} between objects -- \emph{hard} and \emph{soft} closeness. Under it, we derive an analytical form for the \textit{estimated similarity matrix} that accommodates both types of closeness between samples, thereby introducing dependency-aware loss functions. We validate our approach, \emph{Dependent TS2Vec}, on temporal and spatio-temporal downstream problems. Given the dependency patterns presented in the data, our approach surpasses modern ones for dependent data, highlighting the effectiveness of our theoretically grounded loss functions for SSL in capturing spatio-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we outperform TS2Vec on the standard UEA and UCR benchmarks, with accuracy improvements of $4.17$\% and $2.08$\%, respectively. Furthermore, on the drought classification task, which involves complex spatio-temporal patterns, our method achieves a $7$\% higher ROC-AUC score.

Abstract: The recent advancements in Large Language Models(LLMs) have had a significant impact on a wide range of fields, from general domains to specialized areas. However, these advancements have also significantly increased the potential for malicious users to exploit harmful and jailbreak prompts for malicious attacks. Although there have been many efforts to prevent harmful prompts and jailbreak prompts, protecting LLMs from such malicious attacks remains an important and challenging task. In this paper, we propose QGuard, a simple yet effective safety guard method, that utilizes question prompting to block harmful prompts in a zero-shot manner. Our method can defend LLMs not only from text-based harmful prompts but also from multi-modal harmful prompt attacks. Moreover, by diversifying and modifying guard questions, our approach remains robust against the latest harmful prompts without fine-tuning. Experimental results show that our model performs competitively on both text-only and multi-modal harmful datasets. Additionally, by providing an analysis of question prompting, we enable a white-box analysis of user inputs. We believe our method provides valuable insights for real-world LLM services in mitigating security risks associated with harmful prompts.

<title>What Is the Point of Equality in Machine Learning Fairness? Beyond Equality of Opportunity</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16782</link>

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning (ML) has become a rapidly growing area of research. But why, in the first place, is unfairness in ML wrong? And why should we care about improving fairness? Most fair-ML research implicitly appeals to distributive equality: the idea that desirable benefits and goods, such as opportunities (e.g., Barocas et al., 2023), should be equally distributed across society. Unfair ML models, then, are seen as wrong because they unequally distribute such benefits. This paper argues that this exclusive focus on distributive equality offers an incomplete and potentially misleading ethical foundation. Grounding ML fairness in egalitarianism--the view that equality is a fundamental moral and social ideal--requires challenging structural inequality: systematic, institutional, and durable arrangements that privilege some groups while disadvantaging others. Structural inequality manifests through ML systems in two primary forms: allocative harms (e.g., economic loss) and representational harms (e.g., stereotypes, erasure). While distributive equality helps address allocative harms, it fails to explain why representational harms are wrong--why it is wrong for ML systems to reinforce social hierarchies that stratify people into superior and inferior groups--and why ML systems should aim to foster a society where people relate as equals (i.e., relational equality). To address these limitations, the paper proposes a multifaceted egalitarian framework for ML fairness that integrates both distributive and relational equality. Drawing on critical social and political philosophy, this framework offers a more comprehensive ethical foundation for tackling the full spectrum of harms perpetuated by ML systems. The paper also outlines practical pathways for implementing the framework across the entire ML pipeline.

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across many natural language processing tasks. Nonetheless, their quadratic computational and memory requirements, particularly in self-attention layers, pose challenges for efficient inference on long contexts and for deployment in resource-limited environments. We present TPTT (Transforming Pretrained Transformers into Titans), a framework designed to augment pretrained Transformers with linearized attention (LiZA) and internal memory gating via Memory as Gate (MaG), applied without full retraining. TPTT supports parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) and integrates with standard toolkits such as Hugging Face Transformers. We evaluated TPTT on several pretrained models, including Llama-1B, OlMoE-1B-7B, Qwen2.5-1.5B, Gemma3-270m, OpenELM-1.3B, and Mistral-7B, in order to assess applicability across architectures of different scales.Experiments on models with approximately 1 billion parameters, evaluated primarily on the MMLU benchmark, suggest potential improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline models. For example, Titans-Llama-1B exhibited up to a 20\% relative increase in Exact Match scores in one-shot evaluation. An additional finding is that it is possible to convert a quadratic-attention model into a purely linear-attention model using the DeltaProduct mechanism. All training runs were carried out with modest computational resources.These preliminary findings indicate that TPTT may help adapt pretrained LLMs for long-context tasks with limited overhead. Further studies on larger models and a broader set of benchmarks will be necessary to evaluate the generality and robustness of the framework.

<title>Flow-Modulated Scoring for Semantic-Aware Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion demands effective modeling of multifaceted semantic relationships between entities. Yet, prevailing methods, which rely on static scoring functions over learned embeddings, struggling to simultaneously capture rich semantic context and the dynamic nature of relations. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Flow-Modulated Scoring (FMS) framework, conceptualizing a relation as a dynamic evolutionary process governed by its static semantic environment. FMS operates in two stages: it first learns context-aware entity embeddings via a Semantic Context Learning module, and then models a dynamic flow between them using a Conditional Flow-Matching module. This learned flow dynamically modulates a base static score for the entity pair. By unifying context-rich static representations with a conditioned dynamic flow, FMS achieves a more comprehensive understanding of relational semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FMS establishes a new state of the art across both canonical knowledge graph completion tasks: relation prediction and entity prediction. On the standard relation prediction benchmark FB15k-237, FMS achieves a near-perfect MRR of 99.8\% and Hits@1 of 99.7\% using a mere 0.35M parameters, while also attaining a 99.9\% MRR on WN18RR. Its dominance extends to entity prediction, where it secures a 25.2\% relative MRR gain in the transductive setting and substantially outperforms all baselines in challenging inductive settings. By unifying a dynamic flow mechanism with rich static contexts, FMS offers a highly effective and parameter-efficient new paradigm for knowledge graph completion.

<title>Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</title>

Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet datasets and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS, DVS-GESTURE, and SHD datasets, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69% accuracy gain and 4.16x lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be open-sourced.

<title>Iterative Distillation for Reward-Guided Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models in Biomolecular Design</title>

Abstract: We address the problem of fine-tuning diffusion models for reward-guided generation in biomolecular design. While diffusion models have proven highly effective in modeling complex, high-dimensional data distributions, real-world applications often demand more than high-fidelity generation, requiring optimization with respect to potentially non-differentiable reward functions such as physics-based simulation or rewards based on scientific knowledge. Although RL methods have been explored to fine-tune diffusion models for such objectives, they often suffer from instability, low sample efficiency, and mode collapse due to their on-policy nature. In this work, we propose an iterative distillation-based fine-tuning framework that enables diffusion models to optimize for arbitrary reward functions. Our method casts the problem as policy distillation: it collects off-policy data during the roll-in phase, simulates reward-based soft-optimal policies during roll-out, and updates the model by minimizing the KL divergence between the simulated soft-optimal policy and the current model policy. Our off-policy formulation, combined with KL divergence minimization, enhances training stability and sample efficiency compared to existing RL-based methods. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superior reward optimization of our approach across diverse tasks in protein, small molecule, and regulatory DNA design.

Abstract: Intelligent control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) swarms has emerged as a critical research focus, and it typically requires the swarm to navigate effectively while avoiding obstacles and achieving continuous coverage over multiple mission targets. Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the semantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role structures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks demonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive prior knowledge. However, due to the lack of online learning and over-reliance on static priors, these works often struggle with effective exploration, leading to reduced individual potential and overall system performance. To address these limitations, we propose a Role-Adaptive LLM-Driven Yoked navigation algorithm RALLY. Specifically, we first develop an LLM-driven semantic decision framework that uses structured natural language for efficient semantic communication and collaborative reasoning. Afterward, we introduce a dynamic role-heterogeneity mechanism for adaptive role switching and personalized decision-making. Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing Network (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors with MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection strategies. Experiments in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE) environment and a Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) platform demonstrate that RALLY outperforms conventional approaches in terms of task coverage, convergence speed, and generalization, highlighting its strong potential for collaborative navigation in agentic multi-UAV systems.

Abstract: Instance segmentation of novel objects instances in RGB images, given some example images for each object, is a well known problem in computer vision. Designing a model general enough to be employed for all kinds of novel objects without (re-) training has proven to be a difficult task. To handle this, we present a new training-free framework, called: Novel Object Cyclic Threshold based Instance Segmentation (NOCTIS). NOCTIS integrates two pre-trained models: Grounded-SAM 2 for object proposals with precise bounding boxes and corresponding segmentation masks; and DINOv2 for robust class and patch embeddings, due to its zero-shot capabilities. Internally, the proposal-object matching is realized by determining an object matching score based on the similarity of the class embeddings and the average maximum similarity of the patch embeddings with a new cyclic thresholding (CT) mechanism that mitigates unstable matches caused by repetitive textures or visually similar patterns. Beyond CT, NOCTIS introduces: (i) an appearance score that is unaffected by object selection bias; (ii) the usage of the average confidence of the proposals bounding box and mask as a scoring component; and (iii) an RGB-only pipeline that performs even better than RGB-D ones. We empirically show that NOCTIS, without further training/fine tuning, attains state-of-the-art results regarding the mean AP score, w.r.t. the best RGB and RGB-D methods on the seven core datasets of the BOP 2023 challenge for the "Model-based 2D segmentation of unseen objects" task.

arXiv:2507.03152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing use of language models (LMs) in clinical environments, there is an immediate need to evaluate the accuracy and safety of LM-generated medical text. Currently, such evaluation relies solely on manual physician review. However, detecting errors in LM-generated text is challenging because 1) manual review is costly and 2) expert-composed reference outputs are often unavailable in real-world settings. While the "LM-as-judge" paradigm (a LM evaluating another LM) offers scalable evaluation, even frontier LMs can miss subtle but clinically significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose MedVAL, a self-supervised framework that leverages synthetic data to train evaluator LMs to assess whether LM-generated medical outputs are factually consistent with inputs, without requiring physician labels or reference outputs. To evaluate LM performance, we introduce MedVAL-Bench, a dataset containing 840 outputs annotated by physicians, following a physician-defined taxonomy of risk levels and error categories. Across 6 diverse medical tasks and 10 state-of-the-art LMs spanning open-source, proprietary, and medically adapted models, MedVAL fine-tuning significantly improves (p < 0.001) alignment with physicians on both seen and unseen tasks, increasing average F1 scores from 66% to 83%, with per-sample safety classification scores up to 86%. MedVAL improves the performance of even the best-performing proprietary LM (GPT-4o) by 8%. To support a scalable, risk-aware pathway towards clinical integration, we open-source the 1) codebase (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/MedVAL), 2) MedVAL-Bench (https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-Bench), and 3) MedVAL-4B (https://huggingface.co/stanfordmimi/MedVAL-4B), the best-performing open-source LM. Our research provides the first evidence of LMs approaching expert-level validation ability for medical text.

Abstract: We introduce scenario-based cognitive status identification in older drivers from naturalistic driving videos, leveraging large vision models. In recent times, cognitive decline including Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), is often underdiagnosed due to the time-consuming and costly nature of current diagnostic methods. By analyzing real-world driving behavior captured through in-vehicle sensors, this study aims to extract "digital fingerprints" that correlate with functional decline and clinical features of dementia. Moreover, modern large vision models can draw meaningful insights from everyday driving patterns across different roadway scenarios to early detect cognitive decline. We propose a framework that uses large vision models and naturalistic driving videos to analyze driver behavior, identify cognitive status and predict disease progression. We leverage the strong relationship between real-world driving behavior as an observation of the current cognitive status of the drivers where the vehicle can be utilized as a "diagnostic tool". Our method identifies early warning signs of functional impairment, contributing to proactive intervention strategies. This work enhances early detection and supports the development of scalable, non-invasive monitoring systems to mitigate the growing societal and economic burden of cognitive decline in the aging population.

Abstract: Current long chain-of-thought (long-CoT) models excel at mathematical reasoning but rely on slow and error-prone natural language traces. Tool-augmented agents address arithmetic via code execution, but often falter on complex logical tasks. We introduce a fine-tuning framework, DualDistill, that distills complementary reasoning strategies from multiple teachers into a unified student model. Using this approach, we train Agentic-R1, which dynamically selects the optimal strategy for each query, invoking tools for arithmetic and algorithmic problems, and using text-based reasoning for abstract ones. Our method improves accuracy across a range of tasks, including both computation-intensive and standard benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy distillation in achieving robust and efficient reasoning.

<title>Bottom-up Domain-specific Superintelligence: A Reliable Knowledge Graph is What We Need</title>

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones. A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist. Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench. Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3 transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is 0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future research. Code and data are coming soon!

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to facilitate complementary communication between local and global information. Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences, we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk429/GPI-Net.

Abstract: Diffusion models, initially developed for image synthesis, demonstrate remarkable generative capabilities. Recently, their application has expanded to time series forecasting (TSF), yielding promising results. Existing surveys on time series primarily focus on the application of diffusion models to time series tasks or merely provide model-by-model introductions of diffusion-based TSF models, without establishing a systematic taxonomy for existing diffusion-based TSF models. In this survey, we firstly introduce several standard diffusion models and their prevalent variants, explaining their adaptation to TSF tasks. Then, we provide a comprehensive review of diffusion models for TSF, paying special attention to the sources of conditional information and the mechanisms for integrating this conditioning within the models. In analyzing existing approaches using diffusion models for TSF, we provide a systematic categorization and a comprehensive summary of them in this survey. Furthermore, we examine several foundational diffusion models applied to TSF, alongside commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the progress and limitations of these approaches, as well as potential future research directions for diffusion-based TSF. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of recent progress and future prospects for diffusion models in TSF, serving as a valuable reference for researchers in the field.

Abstract: While robots have previously utilized rule-based systems or probabilistic models for user interaction, the rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) presents new opportunities to develop LLM-powered robots for enhanced human-robot interaction (HRI). To fully realize these capabilities, however, robots need to collect data such as audio, fine-grained images, video, and locations. As a result, LLMs often process sensitive personal information, particularly within private environments, such as homes. Given the tension between utility and privacy risks, evaluating how current LLMs manage sensitive data is critical. Specifically, we aim to explore the extent to which out-of-the-box LLMs are privacy-aware in the context of household robots. In this work, we present a set of privacy-relevant scenarios developed using the Contextual Integrity (CI) framework. We first surveyed users' privacy preferences regarding in-home robot behaviors and then examined how their privacy orientations affected their choices of these behaviors (N = 450). We then provided the same set of scenarios and questions to state-of-the-art LLMs (N = 10) and found that the agreement between humans and LLMs was generally low. To further investigate the capabilities of LLMs as potential privacy controllers, we implemented four additional prompting strategies and compared their results. We discuss the performance of the evaluated models as well as the implications and potential of AI privacy awareness in human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) are able to process inputs containing up to several million tokens. In the scope of in-context learning (ICL), this translates into using hundreds/thousands of demonstrations in the input prompt, enabling many-shot ICL. In practice, a fixed set of demonstrations is often selected at random in many-shot settings due to (1) high inference costs, (2) the benefits of caching and reusing computations, and (3) the similar performance offered by this strategy compared to others when scaled. In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for demonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal computational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of demonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a disproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The second strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with those selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via k-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several datasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection and surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting caching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude. We also show that adjusting the proportion of demonstrations selected based on different criteria can balance performance and inference cost in many-shot ICL.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models achieve remarkable performance, yet a unified theory explaining their internal mechanisms--how training shapes their representations and enables complex behaviors--remains elusive. We introduce a new analytical framework that models the single-step generation process as a composition of information-processing stages using the language of Markov categories. This compositional perspective provides a unified mathematical language to connect three critical aspects of language modeling that are typically studied in isolation: the training objective, the geometry of the learned representation space, and practical model capabilities. First, our framework provides a precise information-theoretic rationale for the success of multi-token prediction methods like speculative decoding, quantifying the "information surplus" a model's hidden state contains about tokens beyond the immediate next one. Second, we clarify how the standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective compels the model to learn not just the next word, but also the data's intrinsic conditional uncertainty, a process we formalize using categorical entropy. Our central result reveals that NLL training functions as an implicit form of spectral contrastive learning. We prove that, for common model architectures, this simple predictive objective forces the model to sculpt a geometrically structured representation space, implicitly aligning representations with the eigenspectrum of a "predictive similarity" operator. This work offers a powerful new lens to understand how information flows through a model and how the training objective shapes its internal geometry, thereby bridging the gap between learning theory and the practical success of large language models.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer low energy consumption due to their event-driven nature. Beyond binary spike outputs, their intrinsic floating-point dynamics merit greater attention. Neuronal threshold levels and reset modes critically determine spike count and timing. Hard reset cause information loss, while soft reset apply uniform treatment to neurons. To address these issues, we design an adaptive reset neuron that establishes relationships between inputs, outputs, and reset, while integrating a simple yet effective threshold adjustment strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves excellent performance while maintaining lower energy consumption. In particular, it attains state-of-the-art accuracy on Tiny-ImageNet and CIFAR10-DVS. Codes are available at https://github.com/2ephyrus/AR-LIF.

Abstract: Classroom behavior monitoring is a critical aspect of educational research, with significant implications for student engagement and learning outcomes. Recent advancements in Visual Question Answering (VQA) models offer promising tools for automatically analyzing complex classroom interactions from video recordings. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of several state-of-the-art open-source VQA models, including LLaMA2, LLaMA3, QWEN3, and NVILA, in the context of classroom behavior analysis. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce our BAV-Classroom-VQA dataset derived from real-world classroom video recordings at the Banking Academy of Vietnam. We present the methodology for data collection, annotation, and benchmark the performance of the selected VQA models on this dataset. Our initial experimental results demonstrate that all four models achieve promising performance levels in answering behavior-related visual questions, showcasing their potential in future classroom analytics and intervention systems.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized data sources while preserving data privacy. However, the growing size of Machine Learning (ML) models poses communication and computation challenges in FL. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently been introduced into FL as an efficient fine-tuning method, reducing communication overhead by updating only a small number of trainable parameters. Despite its effectiveness, how to aggregate LoRA-updated local models on the server remains a critical and understudied problem. In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for LoRA-based FL. We first categories the current aggregation method into two major type: Sum-Product (SP) and Product-Sum (PS). Then we formally define the Aggregation-Broadcast Operator (ABO) and derive both weak and strong convergence condition under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we present both weak and strong convergence condition that guarantee convergence of the local model and the global model respectively. These theoretical analyze offer a principled understanding of various aggregation strategies. Notably, we prove that the SP and PS aggregation methods satisfy the weak and strong convergence condition respectively, but differ in their ability to achieve the optimal convergence rate. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs, coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance. The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with respect to those contracts.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D foundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization process that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased computational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact and fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast weighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This approach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted features, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the autoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we introduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian attributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant Gaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric details. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little as 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.

arXiv:2508.05702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), and the growing frequency of extreme weather events have significantly increased the complexity of power grid planning, operation, and management. Traditional rule-based systems and numerical optimization approaches often struggle with the scale, dynamics, and adaptability required by modern power networks. This paper introduces Grid-Agent, an autonomous, AI-driven framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with multi-agent reinforcement learning to detect and remediate grid violations in real time. Grid-Agent integrates semantic reasoning with numerical precision through a modular agent architecture: a planning agent generates coordinated action sequences using numerical power flow solvers, while a validation agent evaluates system stability and action effectiveness via sandboxed execution with safety rollbacks. To ensure scalability, Grid-Agent incorporates an adaptive multiscale network representation that dynamically selects optimal encoding schemes based on network size and complexity. The framework enables coordinated violation resolution through optimizing switch configurations, battery deployment, and load curtailment strategies. Experimental results in standard IEEE and CIGRE test systems (IEEE 69-bus, CIGRE MV, and IEEE 30-bus) demonstrate superior violation mitigation performance. Additionally, the framework's built-in data collection and learning capabilities enable continuous learning and adaptation to diverse network topologies. The autonomous nature of the framework makes it particularly suitable for modern smart grid applications requiring rapid response to dynamic operating conditions.

<title>LLM Serving Optimization with Variable Prefill and Decode Lengths</title>

arXiv:2508.06133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of serving LLM (Large Language Model) requests where each request has heterogeneous prefill and decode lengths. In LLM serving, the prefill length corresponds to the input prompt length, which determines the initial memory usage in the KV cache. The decode length refers to the number of output tokens generated sequentially, with each additional token increasing the KV cache memory usage by one unit. Given a set of n requests, our goal is to schedule and process them to minimize the total completion time. We show that this problem is NP-hard due to the interplay of batching, placement constraints, precedence relationships, and linearly increasing memory usage. We then analyze commonly used scheduling strategies in practice, such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-First (SF), and prove that their competitive ratios scale up sublinearly with the memory limit-a significant drawback in real-world settings where memory demand is large. To address this, we propose a novel algorithm based on a new selection metric that efficiently forms batches over time. We prove that this algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio. Finally, we develop and evaluate a few algorithm variants inspired by this approach, including dynamic programming variants, local search methods, and an LP-based scheduler, demonstrating through comprehensive simulations that they outperform standard baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis might fail due to bias. In this work, we identified class-feature bias, which refers to models' potential reliance on features that are strongly correlated with only a subset of classes, leading to biased performance and poor generalization on other classes. We aim to train a class-unbiased model (Cls-unbias) that mitigates both class imbalance and class-feature bias simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a class-wise inequality loss which promotes equal contributions of classification loss from positive-class and negative-class samples. We propose to optimize a class-wise group distributionally robust optimization objective-a class-weighted training objective that upweights underperforming classes-to enhance the effectiveness of the inequality loss under class imbalance. Through synthetic and real-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate that class-feature bias can negatively impact model performance. Our proposed method effectively mitigates both class-feature bias and class imbalance, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for scalable, interactive mental health assessment, but excessive querying by LLMs burdens users and is inefficient for real-world screening across transdiagnostic symptom profiles. We introduce MAQuA, an adaptive question-asking framework for simultaneous, multidimensional mental health screening. Combining multi-outcome modeling on language responses with item response theory (IRT) and factor analysis, MAQuA selects the questions with most informative responses across multiple dimensions at each turn to optimize diagnostic information, improving accuracy and potentially reducing response burden. Empirical results on a novel dataset reveal that MAQuA reduces the number of assessment questions required for score stabilization by 50-87% compared to random ordering (e.g., achieving stable depression scores with 71% fewer questions and eating disorder scores with 85% fewer questions). MAQuA demonstrates robust performance across both internalizing (depression, anxiety) and externalizing (substance use, eating disorder) domains, with early stopping strategies further reducing patient time and burden. These findings position MAQuA as a powerful and efficient tool for scalable, nuanced, and interactive mental health screening, advancing the integration of LLM-based agents into real-world clinical workflows.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) due to a critical adaptation gap: they lack the local inductive biases required for dense prediction and employ inflexible feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal fusion. Our method proposes a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation models to dense perception tasks.

Abstract: Reliable indoor navigation remains a significant challenge in complex environments, particularly where external positioning signals and dedicated infrastructures are unavailable. This research presents Grid2Guide, a hybrid navigation framework that combines the A* search algorithm with a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate clear, human-readable route instructions. The framework first conducts a binary occupancy matrix from a given indoor map. Using this matrix, the A* algorithm computes the optimal path between origin and destination, producing concise textual navigation steps. These steps are then transformed into natural language instructions by the SLM, enhancing interpretability for end users. Experimental evaluations across various indoor scenarios demonstrate the method's effectiveness in producing accurate and timely navigation guidance. The results validate the proposed approach as a lightweight, infrastructure-free solution for real-time indoor navigation support.

arXiv:2508.08551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible, well-organized format. While state-of-the-art video generation models demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a topdown approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-binding sites (epitopes) on antigens is crucial for vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, therapeutic antibody development, antibody engineering, research into autoimmune and allergic diseases, and for advancing our understanding of immune responses. Despite in silico methods that have been proposed to predict both linear (continuous) and conformational (discontinuous) epitopes, they consistently underperform in predicting conformational epitopes. In this work, we propose a conformer-based model trained on antigen sequences derived from 1,080 antigen-antibody complexes, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract local features and Transformers to capture long-range dependencies within antigen sequences. Ablation studies demonstrate that CNN enhances the prediction of linear epitopes, and the Transformer module improves the prediction of conformational epitopes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing baselines in terms of PCC, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and F1 scores on both linear and conformational epitopes.

Abstract: The flow matching has rapidly become a dominant paradigm in classical generative modeling, offering an efficient way to interpolate between two complex distributions. We extend this idea to the quantum realm and introduce the Quantum Flow Matching (QFM-a fully quantum-circuit realization that offers efficient interpolation between two density matrices. QFM offers systematic preparation of density matrices and generation of samples for accurately estimating observables, and can be realized on quantum computers without the need for costly circuit redesigns. We validate its versatility on a set of applications: (i) generating target states with prescribed magnetization and entanglement entropy, (ii) estimating nonequilibrium free-energy differences to test the quantum Jarzynski equality, and (iii) expediting the study on superdiffusion. These results position QFM as a unifying and promising framework for generative modeling across quantum systems.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to detect defective parts of a sample by having access, during training, to a set of normal, i.e. defect-free, data. It has many applications in fields, such as industrial inspection or medical imaging, where acquiring labels is costly or when we want to avoid introducing biases in the type of anomalies that can be spotted. In this work, we propose a novel UAD method based on prototype learning and introduce a metric to compare a structured set of embeddings that balances a feature-based cost and a spatial-based cost. We leverage this metric to learn local and global prototypes with optimal transport from latent representations extracted with a pre-trained image encoder. We demonstrate that our approach can enforce a structural constraint when learning the prototypes, allowing to capture the underlying organization of the normal samples, thus improving the detection of incoherencies in images. Our model achieves performance that is on par with strong baselines on two reference benchmarks for anomaly detection on industrial images.

Abstract: Inventory management in dynamic and competitive business environments presents multidimensional challenges, particularly in the face of demand uncertainty and logistical and financial constraints. In this context, accurate demand forecasting is critical for optimizing resources and anticipating market fluctuations. However, the isolated use of traditional metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) can lead to biased evaluations and limit model robustness. To address this limitation, we propose the Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF), a composite function that integrates R2, MAE, and RMSE under a hierarchical and dynamic framework, complemented by adaptive penalties. The study implements HEF in the optimization of multiple prediction models, applying Grid Search, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Optuna, and evaluating their performance on reference databases (Walmart, M3, M4, and M5). The results, validated using statistical tests, confirm that HEF consistently outperforms the MAE used as the evaluation function in global metrics such as R2, Global Relative Precision, RMSE, and RMSSE, improving explanatory power and stability against extreme errors. In contrast, the MAE retains advantages in simplicity and computational efficiency. In summary, HEF constitutes a robust and adaptive alternative for highly variable environments, providing a solid framework for model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

This paradigm has driven significant advances in various vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency- and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

<title>Adaptively Robust LLM Inference Optimization under Prediction Uncertainty</title>

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore, it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler, highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

<title>SparK: Query-Aware Unstructured Sparsity with Recoverable KV Cache Channel Pruning</title>

Abstract: Long-context inference in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by the KV cache bottleneck: memory usage grows linearly with sequence length, while attention computation scales quadratically. Existing approaches address this issue by compressing the KV cache along the temporal axis through strategies such as token eviction or merging to reduce memory and computational overhead. However, these methods often neglect fine-grained importance variations across feature dimensions (i.e., the channel axis), thereby limiting their ability to effectively balance efficiency and model accuracy. In reality, we observe that channel saliency varies dramatically across both queries and positions: certain feature channels carry near-zero information for a given query, while others spike in relevance. To address this oversight, we propose SPARK, a training-free plug-and-play method that applies unstructured sparsity by pruning KV at the channel level, while dynamically restoring the pruned entries during attention score computation. Notably, our approach is orthogonal to existing KV compression and quantization techniques, making it compatible for integration with them to achieve further acceleration. By reducing channel-level redundancy, SPARK enables processing of longer sequences within the same memory budget. For sequences of equal length, SPARK not only preserves or improves model accuracy but also reduces KV cache storage by over 30% compared to eviction-based methods. Furthermore, even with an aggressive pruning ratio of 80%, SPARK maintains performance with less degradation than 5% compared to the baseline eviction method, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Xnhyacinth/SparK.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) with wearable devices requires both strong generalization across diverse users and efficient personalization for individuals. However, conventional HAR models often fail to generalize when faced with user-specific variations, leading to degraded performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel on-device few-shot learning framework that bridges generalization and personalization in wearable HAR. Our method first trains a generalizable representation across users and then rapidly adapts to new users with only a few labeled samples, updating lightweight classifier layers directly on resource-constrained devices. This approach achieves robust on-device learning with minimal computation and memory cost, making it practical for real-world deployment. We implement our framework on the energy-efficient RISC-V GAP9 microcontroller and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets (RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, Ultrasound-Gesture). Across these scenarios, post-deployment adaptation improves accuracy by 3.73%, 17.38%, and 3.70%, respectively. These results demonstrate that few-shot on-device learning enables scalable, user-aware, and energy-efficient wearable human activity recognition by seamlessly uniting generalization and personalization \footnote{https://github.com/kangpx/onlineTiny2023}.

Abstract: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death among adolescents. Previous suicide risk prediction studies have primarily focused on either textual or acoustic information in isolation, the integration of multimodal signals, such as speech and text, offers a more comprehensive understanding of an individual's mental state. Motivated by this, and in the context of the 1st SpeechWellness detection challenge, we explore a lightweight multi-branch multimodal system based on a dynamic fusion mechanism for speechwellness detection. To address the limitation of prior approaches that rely on time-domain waveforms for acoustic analysis, our system incorporates both time-domain and time-frequency (TF) domain acoustic features, as well as semantic representations. In addition, we introduce a dynamic fusion block to adaptively integrate information from different modalities. Specifically, it applies learnable weights to each modality during the fusion process, enabling the model to adjust the contribution of each modality. To enhance computational efficiency, we design a lightweight structure by simplifying the original baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system exhibits superior performance compared to the challenge baseline, achieving a 78% reduction in model parameters and a 5% improvement in accuracy.

Abstract: We study how architectural inductive biases influence the cognitive behavior of large language models (LLMs) in instructional dialogue. We introduce a symbolic scaffolding mechanism paired with a short-term memory schema designed to promote adaptive, structured reasoning in Socratic tutoring. Using controlled ablation across five system variants, we evaluate model outputs via expert-designed rubrics covering scaffolding, responsiveness, symbolic reasoning, and conversational memory. We present preliminary results using an LLM-based evaluation framework aligned to a cognitively grounded rubric. This enables scalable, systematic comparisons across architectural variants in early-stage experimentation. The preliminary results show that our full system consistently outperforms baseline variants. Analysis reveals that removing memory or symbolic structure degrades key cognitive behaviors, including abstraction, adaptive probing, and conceptual continuity. These findings support a processing-level account in which architectural scaffolds can reliably shape emergent instructional strategies in LLMs.

Abstract: In the past two years, large language model (LLM)-based chatbots, such as ChatGPT, have revolutionized various domains by enabling diverse task completion and question-answering capabilities. However, their application in scientific research remains constrained by challenges such as hallucinations, limited domain-specific knowledge, and lack of explainability or traceability for the response. Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) has emerged as a promising approach to improving chatbot reliability by integrating domain-specific contextual information before response generation, addressing some limitations of standard LLMs. Despite its potential, there are only limited studies that evaluate GraphRAG on specific domains that require intensive knowledge, like Alzheimer's disease or other biomedical domains. In this paper, we assess the quality and traceability of two popular GraphRAG systems. We compile a database of 50 papers and 70 expert questions related to Alzheimer's disease, construct a GraphRAG knowledge base, and employ GPT-4o as the LLM for answering queries. We then compare the quality of responses generated by GraphRAG with those from a standard GPT-4o model. Additionally, we discuss and evaluate the traceability of several Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG systems. Finally, we provide an easy-to-use interface with a pre-built Alzheimer's disease database for researchers to test the performance of both standard RAG and GraphRAG.

Summary: 
The paper introduces LINKO, a framework that utilizes large language models to enhance medical concept representation learning by leveraging multiple ontology graphs simultaneously. LINKO incorporates dual-axis knowledge propagation within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to improve concept embedding. Through the use of engineered prompts and ontology context, LINKO initializes concept embedding and performs knowledge propagation both vertically within ontology hierarchies and horizontally across different ontology systems. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate LINKO's superior performance compared to existing methods. As a plug-in encoder for electronic health record (EHR) predictive models, LINKO shows enhanced robustness in scenarios with limited data availability and in predicting rare diseases.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships, overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.

Summary:<br /><br />
Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but struggle with simple interactive tasks. Traditional reinforcement learning agents acquire procedural knowledge through environmental interaction but lack transparency. The Think in Games (TiG) framework empowers LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game environments. TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a language modeling task, generating language-guided policies refined through online reinforcement learning. Experimental results show TiG bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge with lower data and computational demands than conventional RL methods. TiG provides step-by-step natural language explanations for decisions, enhancing transparency and interpretability in complex interactive tasks. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding, yet they frequently struggle with simple interactive tasks that young children perform effortlessly. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap between declarative knowledge (knowing about something) and procedural knowledge (knowing how to do something). Although traditional reinforcement learning (RL) agents can acquire procedural knowledge through environmental interaction, they often operate as black boxes and require substantial training data. In contrast, LLMs possess extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but are unable to effectively convert this static knowledge into dynamic decision-making in interactive settings. To address this challenge, we propose Think in Games (TiG), a novel framework that empowers LLMs to develop procedural understanding through direct interaction with game environments, while retaining their inherent reasoning and explanatory abilities. Specifically, TiG reformulates RL-based decision-making as a language modeling task: LLMs generate language-guided policies, which are refined iteratively through online reinforcement learning based on environmental feedback. Our experimental results show that TiG successfully bridges the gap between declarative and procedural knowledge, achieving competitive performance with dramatically lower data and computational demands compared to conventional RL methods. Moreover, TiG provides step-by-step natural language explanations for its decisions, greatly improving transparency and interpretability in complex interactive tasks.

Summary:
- Introduction of AHELM, a benchmark for evaluating audio-language models (ALMs) across 10 aspects including audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, bias, fairness, and safety.
- AHELM aggregates various datasets, including new synthetic audio-text datasets called PARADE and CoRe-Bench, to provide a holistic evaluation of ALMs.
- Standardized prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics are used to ensure fair comparisons across models.
- Testing 14 ALMs and baseline systems show Gemini 2.5 Pro ranking top in 5 aspects but exhibiting group fairness issues on ASR tasks.
- Baseline systems also perform well on AHELM, with one ranking 5th overall despite having limited capabilities. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluations of audio-language models (ALMs) -- multimodal models that take interleaved audio and text as input and output text -- are hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks; most benchmarks measure only one or two capabilities and omit evaluative aspects such as fairness or safety. Furthermore, comparison across models is difficult as separate evaluations test a limited number of models and use different prompting methods and inference parameters. To address these shortfalls, we introduce AHELM, a benchmark that aggregates various datasets -- including 2 new synthetic audio-text datasets called PARADE, which evaluates the ALMs on avoiding stereotypes, and CoRe-Bench, which measures reasoning over conversational audio through inferential multi-turn question answering -- to holistically measure the performance of ALMs across 10 aspects we have identified as important to the development and usage of ALMs: audio perception, knowledge, reasoning, emotion detection, bias, fairness, multilinguality, robustness, toxicity, and safety. We also standardize the prompts, inference parameters, and evaluation metrics to ensure equitable comparisons across models. We test 14 open-weight and closed-API ALMs from 3 developers and 3 additional simple baseline systems each consisting of an automatic speech recognizer and a language model. Our results show that while Gemini 2.5 Pro ranks top in 5 out of 10 aspects, it exhibits group unfairness ($p=0.01$) on ASR tasks whereas most of the other models do not. We also find that the baseline systems perform reasonably well on AHELM, with one ranking 5th overall despite having only speech-to-text capabilities. For transparency, all raw prompts, model generations, and outputs are available on our website at https://crfm.stanford.edu/helm/audio/v1.0.0. AHELM is intended to be a living benchmark and new datasets and models will be added over time.

Summary: 
This article explores the concept of forgetting as a knowledge management operation in an epistemic context. It delves into the various facets of forgetting, such as syntax, propositions, and conditionals, and discusses two main operators – variable elimination and contraction. The focus is on studying forgetting operations in epistemic states with richer semantic structures, allowing for a deeper understanding of what forgetting means in this context. Five general types of epistemic forgetting are identified and instantiated with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions. The article draws inspiration from postulates of forgetting in logic programming and AGM theory to propose a comprehensive set of axioms for evaluating forgetting operations. Through a thorough evaluation based on these postulates, the article provides a detailed overview of the differences and commonalities among various forgetting operators. <div>

Abstract: Forgetting as a knowledge management operation deliberately ignores parts of the knowledge and beliefs of an agent, for various reasons. Forgetting has many facets, one may want to forget parts of the syntax, a proposition, or a conditional. In the literature, two main operators suitable for performing forgetting have been proposed and investigated in depth: First, variable elimination is a syntactical method that blends out certain atomic variables to focus on the rest of the language. It has been mainly used in the area of logic programming and answer set programming. Second, contraction in AGM belief revision theory effectively removes propositions from belief sets under logical deduction. Both operations rely mainly on classical logics. In this article, we take an epistemic perspective and study forgetting operations in epistemic states with richer semantic structures, but with clear links to propositional logic. This allows us to investigate what forgetting in the epistemic background means, thereby lifting well-known and novel forgetting operations to the epistemic level. We present five general types of epistemic forgetting and instantiate them with seven concrete forgetting operations for Spohn's ranking functions. We take inspiration from postulates of forgetting both from logic programming and AGM theory to propose a rich landscape of axioms for evaluating forgetting operations. Finally, we evaluate all concrete forgetting operations according to all postulates, leading to a novel comprehensive overview highlighting differences and commonalities among the forgetting operators.

<div> learning, lifted STRIPS model, sliding-tile puzzle, STRIPS+, SYNTH

Summary: 
The article addresses learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile puzzle from random state-action traces. The challenges include incomplete states and actions in the traces. A new variant, STRIPS+, is introduced to handle implicit action arguments and limited quantification in preconditions. The proposed SYNTH algorithm constructs queries for each action to ground implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. SYNTH is proven to be correct and complete, and its scalability is tested on traces from existing STRIPS domains. <div>

Abstract: Consider the problem of learning a lifted STRIPS model of the sliding-tile puzzle from random state-action traces where the states represent the location of the tiles only, and the actions are the labels up, down, left, and right, with no arguments. Two challenges are involved in this problem. First, the states are not full STRIPS states, as some predicates are missing, like the atoms representing the position of the ``blank''. Second, the actions are not full STRIPS either, as they do not reveal all the objects involved in the actions effects and preconditions. Previous approaches have addressed different versions of this model learning problem, but most assume that actions in the traces are full STRIPS actions or that the domain predicates are all observable. The new setting considered in this work is more ``realistic'', as the atoms observed convey the state of the world but not full STRIPS states, and the actions reveal the arguments needed for selecting the action but not the ones needed for modeling it in STRIPS. For formulating and addressing the learning problem, we introduce a variant of STRIPS, which we call STRIPS+, where certain STRIPS action arguments can be left implicit in preconditions which can also involve a limited form of existential quantification. The learning problem becomes the problem of learning STRIPS+ models from STRIPS+ state-action traces. For this, the proposed learning algorithm, called SYNTH, constructs a stratified sequence (conjunction) of precondition expressions or ``queries'' for each action, that denote unique objects in the state and ground the implicit action arguments in STRIPS+. The correctness and completeness of SYNTH is established, and its scalability is tested on state-action traces obtained from STRIPS+ models derived from existing STRIPS domains.

<div> Keywords: multimodal language models, MMSearch-Plus benchmark, fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, long-horizon tool use

Summary: 
The article introduces the MMSearch-Plus benchmark consisting of 311 tasks that challenge multimodal understanding. These tasks involve extracting weak visual signals, conducting iterative text-image search, and cross-validating answers. The curation process, Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, focuses on extrapolating information from spatial and temporal cues to answer questions accurately. A model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools is provided, and a range of closed and open multimodal language models are evaluated. The strongest agent achieves high accuracy with rollout under the framework, while a strong open-source model shows improvement after search rounds. Bounding-box production and cropped-image search are also assessed, and an error analysis reveals challenges in source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning. <div>

Abstract: Large multimodal language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed as web agents, yet many multimodal browsing benchmarks can be solved by shallow, fixed workflows that lean on high-recall image search and nearby text-masking the genuinely multimodal challenges of fine-grained visual reasoning, provenance verification, and long-horizon tool use. We introduce MMSearch-Plus, a benchmark of 311 tasks that highly demand multimodal understanding while preserving the difficulty profile of strong text-only browsing suites. Each item is constructed to contain multiple weak, localized visual signals that must be extracted, propagated through iterative text-image search, and cross-validated under retrieval noise before answering. Our curation procedure, Spatial-Temporal Extrapolation, seeds questions whose answers require extrapolating from spatial cues (micro-text, part-level appearance, layouts, signage) and temporal traces (broadcast overlays, seasonal context) to out-of-image facts such as events, dates, and venues. We provide a model-agnostic agent framework with browsing tools and evaluate a range of closed and open MLLMs. The strongest agent (o3) attains 15.1% without search and 36.0% accuracy with rollout under our framework, while a strong open-source model (Qwen-2.5-VL-72B-Instruct) achieves 0.0% without search and 6.9% after 20 rounds of search. Beyond answer accuracy, we assess bounding-box production and cropped-image search, and conduct an error analysis that surfaces failures in source verification, part-based reasoning, and long-horizon planning.

<div> Computational framework, wisdom, multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious, AI <br /> 
Summary: <br /> 
- A new computational framework for measuring wisdom was developed, considering multiple dimensions and uncertainty. 
- Traditional wisdom measures often lack the humility and uncertainty inherent in wise reasoning. 
- The study used a fuzzy inference system with Z numbers to assess wisdom scores and confidence in decision-making. 
- Participants were presented with moral dilemma tasks and their responses were mapped into five components of wisdom. 
- Results showed promising correlations with established scales, supporting the validity of the new system. 
- This framework contributes to advancing measurement in psychology and offers AI systems a way to incorporate uncertainty-conscious reasoning for safer, more human-like judgment. <div>
arXiv:2508.21517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Wisdom is a superordinate construct that embraces perspective taking, reflectiveness, prosocial orientation, reflective empathetic action, and intellectual humility. Unlike conventional models of reasoning that are rigidly bound by binary thinking, wisdom unfolds in shades of ambiguity, requiring both graded evaluation and self-reflective humility. Current measures depend on self-reports and seldom reflect the humility and uncertainty inherent in wise reasoning. A computational framework that takes into account both multidimensionality and confidence has the potential to improve psychological science and allow humane AI. Method: We present a fuzzy inference system with Z numbers, each of the decisions being expressed in terms of a wisdom score (restriction) and confidence score (certainty). As part of this study, participants (N = 100) were exposed to culturally neutral pictorial moral dilemma tasks to which they generated think-aloud linguistic responses, which were mapped into five theoretically based components of wisdom. The scores of each individual component were combined using a base of 21 rules, with membership functions tuned via Gaussian kernel density estimation. Results: In a proof of concept study, the system produced dual attribute wisdom representations that correlated modestly but significantly with established scales while showing negligible relations with unrelated traits, supporting convergent and divergent validity. Contribution: The contribution is to formalize wisdom as a multidimensional, uncertainty-conscious construct, operationalized in the form of Z-numbers. In addition to progressing measurement in psychology, it calculates how fuzzy Z numbers can provide AI systems with interpretable, confidence-sensitive reasoning that affords a safe, middle ground between rigorous computation and human-like judgment.

Summary:
Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are used to explain Machine Learning models by showing minimal input changes for a different output. A new paradigm is proposed for planning problems and desired plan properties using counterfactual scenarios. These scenarios require minimal modifications to allow plans that meet specified criteria. The proposal includes two qualitative instantiations involving plan quantification satisfying desired properties. Computational complexity analysis shows generating counterfactual scenarios is practical, often as costly as computing a plan. This framework offers a basis for practical algorithm development in this field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CEs) are a powerful technique used to explain Machine Learning models by showing how the input to a model should be minimally changed for the model to produce a different output. Similar proposals have been made in the context of Automated Planning, where CEs have been characterised in terms of minimal modifications to an existing plan that would result in the satisfaction of a different goal. While such explanations may help diagnose faults and reason about the characteristics of a plan, they fail to capture higher-level properties of the problem being solved. To address this limitation, we propose a novel explanation paradigm that is based on counterfactual scenarios. In particular, given a planning problem $P$ and an \ltlf formula $\psi$ defining desired properties of a plan, counterfactual scenarios identify minimal modifications to $P$ such that it admits plans that comply with $\psi$. In this paper, we present two qualitative instantiations of counterfactual scenarios based on an explicit quantification over plans that must satisfy $\psi$. We then characterise the computational complexity of generating such counterfactual scenarios when different types of changes are allowed on $P$. We show that producing counterfactual scenarios is often only as expensive as computing a plan for $P$, thus demonstrating the practical viability of our proposal and ultimately providing a framework to construct practical algorithms in this area.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process mining has emerged as a powerful analytical technique for understanding complex healthcare workflows. However, its application faces significant barriers, including technical complexity, a lack of standardized approaches, and limited access to practical training resources. We introduce HealthProcessAI, a GenAI framework designed to simplify process mining applications in healthcare and epidemiology by providing a comprehensive wrapper around existing Python (PM4PY) and R (bupaR) libraries. To address unfamiliarity and improve accessibility, the framework integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated process map interpretation and report generation, helping translate technical analyses into outputs that diverse users can readily understand. We validated the framework using sepsis progression data as a proof-of-concept example and compared the outputs of five state-of-the-art LLM models through the OpenRouter platform. To test its functionality, the framework successfully processed sepsis data across four proof-of-concept scenarios, demonstrating robust technical performance and its capability to generate reports through automated LLM analysis. LLM evaluation using five independent LLMs as automated evaluators revealed distinct model strengths: Claude Sonnet-4 and Gemini 2.5-Pro achieved the highest consistency scores (3.79/4.0 and 3.65/4.0) when evaluated by automated LLM assessors. By integrating multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated interpretation and report generation, the framework addresses widespread unfamiliarity with process mining outputs, making them more accessible to clinicians, data scientists, and researchers. This structured analytics and AI-driven interpretation combination represents a novel methodological advance in translating complex process mining results into potentially actionable insights for healthcare applications.

<div> Keywords: generalized landmarks, planning, landmark extraction, state functions, heuristic<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework for discovering generalized landmarks that can be applied across a domain. These landmarks are learned from solved instances and serve as intermediate goals for planning problems. Unlike traditional landmark extraction algorithms, the proposed method uses state functions that are independent of objects, capturing repetition and generalizing beyond specific instances. By constructing a directed generalized landmark graph based on these functions, the framework defines landmark progression and allows for loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. The results demonstrate that these learned generalized landmarks from small instances are effective for larger instances within the same domain. Notably, identifying loops indicating repetition leads to significant improvements in heuristic performance compared to a baseline. Generalized landmarks provide interpretable and valuable domain information for automated planners, and can be extracted from a small set of plans. <div>
arXiv:2508.21564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for discovering landmarks that automatically generalize across a domain. These generalized landmarks are learned from a set of solved instances and describe intermediate goals for planning problems where traditional landmark extraction algorithms fall short. Our generalized landmarks extend beyond the predicates of a domain by using state functions that are independent of the objects of a specific problem and apply to all similar objects, thus capturing repetition. Based on these functions, we construct a directed generalized landmark graph that defines the landmark progression, including loop possibilities for repetitive subplans. We show how to use this graph in a heuristic to solve new problem instances of the same domain. Our results show that the generalized landmark graphs learned from a few small instances are also effective for larger instances in the same domain. If a loop that indicates repetition is identified, we see a significant improvement in heuristic performance over the baseline. Generalized landmarks capture domain information that is interpretable and useful to an automated planner. This information can be discovered from a small set of plans for the same domain.

Abstract: Many high-level multi-agent planning problems, including multi-robot navigation and path planning, can be effectively modeled using deterministic actions and observations.
  In this work, we focus on such domains and introduce the class of Deterministic Decentralized POMDPs (Det-Dec-POMDPs). This is a subclass of Dec-POMDPs characterized by deterministic transitions and observations conditioned on the state and joint actions.
  We then propose a practical solver called Iterative Deterministic POMDP Planning (IDPP). This method builds on the classic Joint Equilibrium Search for Policies framework and is specifically optimized to handle large-scale Det-Dec-POMDPs that current Dec-POMDP solvers are unable to address efficiently.

The proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries, contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a mixed-integer formulation.

Summary:
The article discusses the importance of designing good heuristics for graph search based on domain knowledge. It introduces an extension of the Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*) algorithm to an anytime version called A-MHA*, inspired by Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*). A-MHA* aims to find a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continuously improve it until time constraints are reached. The adaptation of ARA* concepts into the MHA* framework maintains suboptimal and completeness guarantees while enhancing the algorithm to perform continuously. Performance tests are conducted in 3-D path planning and sliding tiles puzzle domains, comparing A-MHA* against MHA* and other anytime algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2508.21637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing good heuristic functions for graph search requires adequate domain knowledge. It is often easy to design heuristics that perform well and correlate with the underlying true cost-to-go values in certain parts of the search space but these may not be admissible throughout the domain thereby affecting the optimality guarantees of the search. Bounded suboptimal search using several such partially good but inadmissible heuristics was developed in Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*). Although MHA* leverages multiple inadmissible heuristics to potentially generate a faster suboptimal solution, the original version does not improve the solution over time. It is a one shot algorithm that requires careful setting of inflation factors to obtain a desired one time solution. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending MHA* to an anytime version that finds a feasible suboptimal solution quickly and continually improves it until time runs out. Our work is inspired from the Anytime Repairing A* (ARA*) algorithm. We prove that our precise adaptation of ARA* concepts in the MHA* framework preserves the original suboptimal and completeness guarantees and enhances MHA* to perform in an anytime fashion. Furthermore, we report the performance of A-MHA* in 3-D path planning domain and sliding tiles puzzle and compare against MHA* and other anytime algorithms.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of leveraging diversity in medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, proposing the MEDLEY framework as a new approach. Rather than eliminating biases in AI models, MEDLEY preserves their diverse outputs and considers biases as potential strengths. By documenting model-specific biases and treating hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification, the framework enhances medical reasoning under clinician supervision. A proof-of-concept demonstrator using over 30 large language models was developed to illustrate the approach, creating a minimum viable product that maintains both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases. This transparency in diagnostic uncertainty and biases allows for clinical oversight, reframing AI imperfections as a resource for developing trustworthy medical AI systems. MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new pathways for regulation, ethics, and innovation in the field of medical AI. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bias in medical artificial intelligence is conventionally viewed as a defect requiring elimination. However, human reasoning inherently incorporates biases shaped by education, culture, and experience, suggesting their presence may be inevitable and potentially valuable. We propose MEDLEY (Medical Ensemble Diagnostic system with Leveraged diversitY), a conceptual framework that orchestrates multiple AI models while preserving their diverse outputs rather than collapsing them into a consensus. Unlike traditional approaches that suppress disagreement, MEDLEY documents model-specific biases as potential strengths and treats hallucinations as provisional hypotheses for clinician verification. A proof-of-concept demonstrator was developed using over 30 large language models, creating a minimum viable product that preserved both consensus and minority views in synthetic cases, making diagnostic uncertainty and latent biases transparent for clinical oversight. While not yet a validated clinical tool, the demonstration illustrates how structured diversity can enhance medical reasoning under clinician supervision. By reframing AI imperfection as a resource, MEDLEY offers a paradigm shift that opens new regulatory, ethical, and innovation pathways for developing trustworthy medical AI systems.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework called PosterForest for automated scientific poster generation, which focuses on capturing the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and integrating textual and visual elements effectively. The framework utilizes the Poster Tree, an intermediate representation that encodes document structure and visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. By employing a multi-agent collaboration strategy involving content summarization and layout planning agents, the framework ensures logical consistency, content fidelity, and visual coherence in the generated posters. Extensive experiments across various academic domains demonstrate that PosterForest outperforms existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The generated posters exhibit high quality similar to expert-designed ones, with superior information preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

arXiv:2508.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel training-free framework, \textit{PosterForest}, for automated scientific poster generation. Unlike prior approaches, which largely neglect the hierarchical structure of scientific documents and the semantic integration of textual and visual elements, our method addresses both challenges directly. We introduce the \textit{Poster Tree}, a hierarchical intermediate representation that jointly encodes document structure and visual-textual relationships at multiple levels. Our framework employs a multi-agent collaboration strategy, where agents specializing in content summarization and layout planning iteratively coordinate and provide mutual feedback. This approach enables the joint optimization of logical consistency, content fidelity, and visual coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple academic domains show that our method outperforms existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The resulting posters achieve quality closest to expert-designed ground truth and deliver superior information preservation, structural clarity, and user preference.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that addresses scalability limitations. The algorithm utilizes a compact encoding of permutations to reduce the qubit requirement and implements an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy. By optimizing the circuit topology on a training instance and then freezing it for novel instances, the algorithm achieves high success rates for TSP instances with 4 to 6 cities. However, the success rate drops significantly for instances with 7 cities, highlighting scalability issues. The study demonstrates the generalization ability of the approach for moderate problem sizes and emphasizes the importance of freezing the Ansatz to reduce time-to-solution without sacrificing quality. Additionally, the paper discusses the impact of warm-start initialization of parameters and explores potential extensions to more complex optimization problems like Vehicle Routing and Job-Shop Scheduling. <div>
arXiv:2508.21730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy: where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters. This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$ cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for 6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of $\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and Job-Shop Scheduling.

<div> Keywords: causal relations, time series analysis, summary causal graph, edge orientation, causal discovery 

Summary:
This article focuses on understanding causal relations between temporal variables through the use of summary causal graphs (SCGs). SCGs provide a high-level abstraction of the causal graph, allowing experts to capture main causal relations while abstracting micro-level details. The study presents conditions that guarantee the orientation of micro-level edges between temporal variables based on the information encoded in SCGs. The results offer theoretical guarantees for edge orientation even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. This research is valuable for improving causal inference in complex temporal systems by leveraging expert knowledge and utilizing SCGs to inform causal discovery from observational time series data. <div>
arXiv:2508.21742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding causal relations between temporal variables is a central challenge in time series analysis, particularly when the full causal structure is unknown. Even when the full causal structure cannot be fully specified, experts often succeed in providing a high-level abstraction of the causal graph, known as a summary causal graph, which captures the main causal relations between different time series while abstracting away micro-level details. In this work, we present conditions that guarantee the orientability of micro-level edges between temporal variables given the background knowledge encoded in a summary causal graph and assuming having access to a faithful and causally sufficient distribution with respect to the true unknown graph. Our results provide theoretical guarantees for edge orientation at the micro-level, even in the presence of cycles or bidirected edges at the macro-level. These findings offer practical guidance for leveraging SCGs to inform causal discovery in complex temporal systems and highlight the value of incorporating expert knowledge to improve causal inference from observational time series data.

TDP balances exploration and exploitation by employing a bi-level sampling process: diverse parent trajectories are generated through particle guidance for broad exploration, and refined sub-trajectories are obtained via fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP overcomes the limitations of gradient guidance by exploring various trajectory regions and leveraging gradient information with pretrained models and test-time reward signals only. The proposed approach is evaluated on maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods consistently. This demonstrates the effectiveness of TDP in solving test-time guided control problems without the need for task-specific training or value estimators, enhancing test-time flexibility and enabling zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: Planning with pretrained diffusion models has emerged as a promising approach for solving test-time guided control problems. However, standard gradient guidance typically performs optimally under convex and differentiable reward landscapes, showing substantially reduced effectiveness in real-world scenarios involving non-convex objectives, non-differentiable constraints, and multi-reward structures. Furthermore, recent supervised planning approaches require task-specific training or value estimators, which limits test-time flexibility and zero-shot generalization. We propose a Tree-guided Diffusion Planner (TDP), a zero-shot test-time planning framework that balances exploration and exploitation through structured trajectory generation. We frame test-time planning as a tree search problem using a bi-level sampling process: (1) diverse parent trajectories are produced via training-free particle guidance to encourage broad exploration, and (2) sub-trajectories are refined through fast conditional denoising guided by task objectives. TDP addresses the limitations of gradient guidance by exploring diverse trajectory regions and harnessing gradient information across this expanded solution space using only pretrained models and test-time reward signals. We evaluate TDP on three diverse tasks: maze gold-picking, robot arm block manipulation, and AntMaze multi-goal exploration. TDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on all tasks.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of clinical narratives is critical for patient care, but the complexity of these notes makes automation challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, single-model approaches can lack the robustness required for high-stakes clinical tasks. We introduce a collaborative multi-agent system (MAS) that models a clinical consultation team to address this gap. The system is tasked with identifying clinical problems by analyzing only the Subjective (S) and Objective (O) sections of SOAP notes, simulating the diagnostic reasoning process of synthesizing raw data into an assessment. A Manager agent orchestrates a dynamically assigned team of specialist agents who engage in a hierarchical, iterative debate to reach a consensus. We evaluated our MAS against a single-agent baseline on a curated dataset of 420 MIMIC-III notes. The dynamic multi-agent configuration demonstrated consistently improved performance in identifying congestive heart failure, acute kidney injury, and sepsis. Qualitative analysis of the agent debates reveals that this structure effectively surfaces and weighs conflicting evidence, though it can occasionally be susceptible to groupthink. By modeling a clinical team's reasoning process, our system offers a promising path toward more accurate, robust, and interpretable clinical decision support tools.

Summary:  
The paper introduces QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy for vision-guided quadruped motion control. It emphasizes the importance of combining proprioception with vision for robust control. QuadKAN incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs, aligning the state-to-action mapping with the smooth nature of gait. The framework enhances sample efficiency, reduces action jitter and energy consumption, and provides interpretable posture-action sensitivities. Utilizing Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for end-to-end training, QuadKAN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse terrains and obstacle scenarios. Results demonstrate higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions, showcasing spline-parameterized policies as a simple, effective, and interpretable solution for robust vision-guided locomotion. <div>

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning (RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.

Summary: 
Proteins are essential in cellular functions and as drug targets, necessitating accurate analysis through mass spectrometry. Current peptide fragment ion probability prediction methods rely on global fragmentation statistics, limiting accuracy. To address this, Pep2Prob introduces a dataset with peptide-specific fragment ion probability statistics from high-quality MS$^2$ spectra. Simple rules and learning-based models demonstrate improved performance using peptide-specific information. The complex relationship between peptides and fragmentation requires sophisticated machine learning approaches to achieve accurate predictions. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.21076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins perform nearly all cellular functions and constitute most drug targets, making their analysis fundamental to understanding human biology in health and disease. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS$^2$) is the major analytical technique in proteomics that identifies peptides by ionizing them, fragmenting them, and using the resulting mass spectra to identify and quantify proteins in biological samples. In MS$^2$ analysis, peptide fragment ion probability prediction plays a critical role, enhancing the accuracy of peptide identification from mass spectra as a complement to the intensity information. Current approaches rely on global statistics of fragmentation, which assumes that a fragment's probability is uniform across all peptides. Nevertheless, this assumption is oversimplified from a biochemical principle point of view and limits accurate prediction. To address this gap, we present Pep2Prob, the first comprehensive dataset and benchmark designed for peptide-specific fragment ion probability prediction. The proposed dataset contains fragment ion probability statistics for 608,780 unique precursors (each precursor is a pair of peptide sequence and charge state), summarized from more than 183 million high-quality, high-resolution, HCD MS$^2$ spectra with validated peptide assignments and fragmentation annotations. We establish baseline performance using simple statistical rules and learning-based methods, and find that models leveraging peptide-specific information significantly outperform previous methods using only global fragmentation statistics. Furthermore, performance across benchmark models with increasing capacities suggests that the peptide-fragmentation relationship exhibits complex nonlinearities requiring sophisticated machine learning approaches.

<div> Keywords: Deep learning, spurious correlations, counterbias data augmentation, bias reduction, out-of-distribution resilience

Summary: 
The article introduces CoBA (CounterBias Augmentation), a framework that addresses the issue of deep learning models relying on spurious correlations in training data. CoBA operates at the semantic triple level, modifying subject-predicate-object triples to disrupt these correlations and generate counterbias data. By reconstructing text from adjusted triples, CoBA mitigates biases such as gender bias and simplicity bias. Experimental results show that CoBA not only improves task performance but also reduces biases and enhances out-of-distribution resilience. This approach offers a versatile solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations in deep learning models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models often learn and exploit spurious correlations in training data, using these non-target features to inform their predictions. Such reliance leads to performance degradation and poor generalization on unseen data. To address these limitations, we introduce a more general form of counterfactual data augmentation, termed counterbias data augmentation, which simultaneously tackles multiple biases (e.g., gender bias, simplicity bias) and enhances out-of-distribution robustness. We present CoBA: CounterBias Augmentation, a unified framework that operates at the semantic triple level: first decomposing text into subject-predicate-object triples, then selectively modifying these triples to disrupt spurious correlations. By reconstructing the text from these adjusted triples, CoBA generates counterbias data that mitigates spurious patterns. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CoBA not only improves downstream task performance, but also effectively reduces biases and strengthens out-of-distribution resilience, offering a versatile and robust solution to the challenges posed by spurious correlations.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines offer a new research direction for model-to-text/code transformations, particularly in the realm of quantum and hybrid quantum-classical software systems. The aim is to leverage model-driven approaches to address the challenges posed by heterogeneous platforms and limited developer expertise in this domain. An experiment showcasing the generation of code from UML model instances using Qiskit library for quantum computers yielded promising results, with well-engineered prompts improving CodeBLEU scores significantly. The potential of this research direction extends to deploying software system model instances in RAG pipelines and utilizing LLMs for code-to-code transformations, such as transpilation tasks, for enhanced efficiency and accuracy in quantum code generation. Further exploration through experiments is recommended to explore these avenues comprehensively.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel research direction for model-to-text/code transformations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) that can be enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. The focus is on quantum and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance, for transpilation use cases.

Summary: 
Safe-Control is a plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in Text-to-Image (T2I) models. It introduces safety control signals into existing T2I models to address safety concerns effectively. The patch-like design allows for flexibility and adaptability, making it compatible with various T2I models of similar architecture. Extensive evaluations on six public T2I models demonstrate that Safe-Control significantly reduces unsafe content generation while maintaining image quality and text alignment. Compared to current safety mechanisms, Safe-Control outperforms all baselines in reducing the probability of unsafe content generation, even under unsafe prompts and adversarial attacks. This innovative approach offers a more robust solution to enhance the safety of T2I models and prevent potential misuse or abuse. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes, RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial, feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes, imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms. These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches, and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical intelligence.

This study introduces a new EEG emotion classification framework using the GAMEEMO dataset, focusing on multigranularity emotion classification. The framework includes preprocessing steps such as feature extraction and normalization to convert EEG signals into input vectors. Emotion labels are encoded across three axes: binary valence classification, multi-class emotion classification, and fine-grained multi-label representation. Various models are evaluated, with the LSTM-GRU model performing the best across tasks, achieving high F1-scores in binary valence, multi-class, and multi-label emotion classification. This approach provides a more comprehensive and generalizable method for EEG-based emotion recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning approaches in this field.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in EEG-based emotion recognition have shown promising outcomes using both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches; however, most existing studies focus narrowly on binary valence prediction or subject-specific classification, which limits generalizability and deployment in real-world affective computing systems. To address this gap, this paper presents a unified, multigranularity EEG emotion classification framework built on the GAMEEMO dataset, which consists of 14-channel EEG recordings and continuous self-reported emotion ratings (boring, horrible, calm, and funny) from 28 subjects across four emotion-inducing gameplay scenarios. Our pipeline employs a structured preprocessing strategy that comprises temporal window segmentation, hybrid statistical and frequency-domain feature extraction, and z-score normalization to convert raw EEG signals into robust, discriminative input vectors. Emotion labels are derived and encoded across three complementary axes: (i) binary valence classification based on the averaged polarity of positive and negative emotion ratings, and (ii) Multi-class emotion classification, where the presence of the most affective state is predicted. (iii) Fine-grained multi-label representation via binning each emotion into 10 ordinal classes. We evaluate a broad spectrum of models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, alongside deep neural architectures such as LSTM, LSTM-GRU, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the LSTM-GRU model consistently outperforms the others, achieving an F1-score of 0.932 in the binary valence task and 94.5% and 90.6% in both multi-class and Multi-Label emotion classification.

Summary: 
PVPO is a reinforcement learning method that enhances efficiency by incorporating an advantage reference anchor and data pre-sampling techniques. By using a reference model for rollout and leveraging reward scores as reference anchors, PVPO corrects biases from intra-group comparisons and reduces the need for extensive rollouts. The reference model also aids in assessing sample difficulty during data pre-sampling, allowing for the selection of high-gain data to enhance training efficiency. Experimental results across nine datasets in two domains show that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art performance, demonstrating robust generalization across tasks and scalability across model sizes. PVPO offers a promising solution for addressing computational cost issues in critic-free reinforcement learning methods.

arXiv:2508.21104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critic-free reinforcement learning methods, particularly group policies, have attracted considerable attention for their efficiency in complex tasks. However, these methods rely heavily on multiple sampling and comparisons within the policy to estimate advantage, which may cause the policy to fall into local optimum and increase computational cost. To address these issues, we propose PVPO, an efficient reinforcement learning method enhanced by an advantage reference anchor and data pre-sampling. Specifically, we use the reference model to rollout in advance and employ the calculated reward score as a reference anchor. Our approach effectively corrects the cumulative bias introduced by intra-group comparisons and significantly reduces reliance on the number of rollouts. Meanwhile, the reference model can assess sample difficulty during data pre-sampling, enabling effective selection of high-gain data to improve training efficiency. Experiments conducted on nine datasets across two domains demonstrate that PVPO achieves State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) performance. Our approach not only demonstrates robust generalization across multiple tasks, but also exhibits scalable performance across models of varying scales.

By leveraging fast symmetric factorization and maintaining a low-rank structure of a preconditioner, AdaGram reduces memory and computational costs. Numerical experiments demonstrate that AdaGram can converge faster or match the performance of diagonal adaptive optimizers when utilizing rank five or smaller rank approximations. This showcases AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive optimization in large models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods like Adagrad and its variants are widespread in large-scale optimization. However, their use of diagonal preconditioning matrices limits the ability to capture parameter correlations. Full-matrix adaptive methods, approximating the exact Hessian, can model these correlations and may enable faster convergence. At the same time, their computational and memory costs are often prohibitive for large-scale models. To address this limitation, we propose AdaGram, an optimizer that enables efficient full-matrix adaptive gradient updates. To reduce memory and computational overhead, we utilize fast symmetric factorization for computing the preconditioned update direction at each iteration. Additionally, we maintain the low-rank structure of a preconditioner along the optimization trajectory using matrix integrator methods. Numerical experiments on standard machine learning tasks show that AdaGram converges faster or matches the performance of diagonal adaptive optimizers when using rank five and smaller rank approximations. This demonstrates AdaGram's potential as a scalable solution for adaptive optimization in large models.

Summary: 
UTRL is a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality unit tests by iteratively training a unit test generator and a code generator in an adversarial manner. The unit test generator is trained to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, while the code generator is trained to produce solutions that pass the unit tests. Experimental results show that LLMs trained with UTRL outperform models trained via supervised fine-tuning and even frontier models like GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests. This demonstrates the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for automated test generation in programming. <div>

Abstract: Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models (LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.

Summary:<br /> This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach utilizes a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three variables.

Abstract: This paper presents a Deep Learning (DL) framework for 48-hour forecasting of temperature, solar irradiance, and relative humidity to support Model Predictive Control (MPC) in smart HVAC systems. The approach employs a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network with attention, capturing temporal and cross-feature dependencies by jointly predicting all three variables. Historical meteorological data (2019-2022) with encoded cyclical time features were used for training, while 2023 data evaluated generalization. The model achieved Mean Absolute Errors of 1.3 degrees Celsius (temperature), 31 W/m2 (irradiance), and 6.7 percentage points (humidity), outperforming state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction and machine learning benchmarks. Integrated Gradients quantified feature contributions, and attention weights revealed temporal patterns, enhancing interpretability. By combining multivariate forecasting, attention-based DL, and explainability, this work advances data-driven weather prediction. The demonstrated accuracy and transparency highlight the framework's potential for energy-efficient building control through reliable short-term meteorological forecasting.

Summary:<br /><br />The study focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to pinpoint anomalies and equipment degradation in Deep Space Network (DSN) data to ensure the smooth operation of spacecraft communications. Various models were trained to reconstruct data, detect anomalies, and classify their severity levels. A reinforcement learning subsystem and Large Language Model provide explanations for anomalies and classify them based on severity. A data pipeline system was implemented to streamline data extraction, parsing, and processing for DSN transmitters, connecting them with antenna data for comprehensive anomaly detection. An agentic AI system utilizes complex reasoning to predict and classify anomalous data entries, with the ability to improve through human feedback. This integrated approach aims to enhance the maintenance and operation of the DSN for upcoming space missions.

Abstract: The Deep Space Network (DSN) is NASA's largest network of antenna facilities that generate a large volume of multivariate time-series data. These facilities contain DSN antennas and transmitters that undergo degradation over long periods of time, which may cause costly disruptions to the data flow and threaten the earth-connection of dozens of spacecraft that rely on the Deep Space Network for their lifeline. The purpose of this study was to experiment with different methods that would be able to assist JPL engineers with directly pinpointing anomalies and equipment degradation through collected data, and continue conducting maintenance and operations of the DSN for future space missions around our universe. As such, we have researched various machine learning techniques that can fully reconstruct data through predictive analysis, and determine anomalous data entries within real-time datasets through statistical computations and thresholds. On top of the fully trained and tested machine learning models, we have also integrated the use of a reinforcement learning subsystem that classifies identified anomalies based on severity level and a Large Language Model that labels an explanation for each anomalous data entry, all of which can be improved and fine-tuned over time through human feedback/input. Specifically, for the DSN transmitters, we have also implemented a full data pipeline system that connects the data extraction, parsing, and processing workflow all together as there was no coherent program or script for performing these tasks before. Using this data pipeline system, we were able to then also connect the models trained from DSN antenna data, completing the data workflow for DSN anomaly detection. This was all wrapped around and further connected by an agentic AI system, where complex reasoning was utilized to determine the classifications and predictions of anomalous data.

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work, introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive, high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for developing advanced embodied foundation models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) equipped with step-by-step thinking capabilities have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning problems. However, this thinking process is redundant for simple problems solvable without complex reasoning. To address this inefficiency, we propose R-4B, an auto-thinking MLLM, which can adaptively decide when to think based on problem complexity. The central idea of R-4B is to empower the model with both thinking and non-thinking capabilities using bi-mode annealing, and apply Bi-mode Policy Optimization~(BPO) to improve the model's accuracy in determining whether to activate the thinking process. Specifically, we first train the model on a carefully curated dataset spanning various topics, which contains samples from both thinking and non-thinking modes. Then it undergoes a second phase of training under an improved GRPO framework, where the policy model is forced to generate responses from both modes for each input query. Experimental results show that R-4B achieves state-of-the-art performance across 25 challenging benchmarks. It outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B in most tasks and achieves performance comparable to larger models such as Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 (16B) on reasoning-intensive benchmarks with lower computational cost.

Abstract: Detecting hidden or partially concealed objects remains a fundamental challenge in multimodal environments, where factors like occlusion, camouflage, and lighting variations significantly hinder performance. Traditional RGB-based detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.

Summary: 
Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are revolutionizing scientific research by integrating knowledge from complex scientific data. This survey explores the co-evolution of Sci-LLMs and their underlying data, emphasizing the challenges posed by heterogeneous, multi-scale, and uncertainty-laden scientific corpora. The survey categorizes scientific data into a unified taxonomy and hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, highlighting the need for domain-specific representations to enable cross-modal reasoning. Evaluation methods for Sci-LLMs have transitioned towards process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced protocols. Persistent issues in scientific data development are addressed, with proposed solutions including semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. The survey proposes a paradigm shift towards closed-loop systems where Sci-LLMs actively contribute to an evolving knowledge base, ultimately aiding in accelerating scientific discovery.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

<div> neural audio codec, WaveLLDM, latent diffusion, audio restoration, denoising
Summary:
WaveLLDM is introduced as a novel approach for audio restoration and denoising, integrating a neural audio codec with latent diffusion. Operating in a compressed latent space, it reduces computational complexity while maintaining reconstruction quality. Empirical evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set show accurate spectral reconstruction with low LSD scores (0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it falls short in terms of perceptual quality and speech clarity compared to existing methods, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. The limitations are attributed to architectural tuning, lack of fine-tuning, and inadequate training duration. Despite these shortcomings, the flexible architecture of WaveLLDM combining a neural audio codec and latent diffusion model lays a solid foundation for future advancements in audio processing technology.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.21153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality audio is essential in a wide range of applications, including online communication, virtual assistants, and the multimedia industry. However, degradation caused by noise, compression, and transmission artifacts remains a major challenge. While diffusion models have proven effective for audio restoration, they typically require significant computational resources and struggle to handle longer missing segments. This study introduces WaveLLDM (Wave Lightweight Latent Diffusion Model), an architecture that integrates an efficient neural audio codec with latent diffusion for audio restoration and denoising. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time or spectral domain, WaveLLDM processes audio in a compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity while preserving reconstruction quality. Empirical evaluations on the Voicebank+DEMAND test set demonstrate that WaveLLDM achieves accurate spectral reconstruction with low Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) scores (0.48 to 0.60) and good adaptability to unseen data. However, it still underperforms compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of perceptual quality and speech clarity, with WB-PESQ scores ranging from 1.62 to 1.71 and STOI scores between 0.76 and 0.78. These limitations are attributed to suboptimal architectural tuning, the absence of fine-tuning, and insufficient training duration. Nevertheless, the flexible architecture that combines a neural audio codec and latent diffusion model provides a strong foundation for future development.

Summary: 
Computed Tomography/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation is challenging due to the need for high accuracy and real-time performance. Traditional methods are limited by spatial information loss and domain gap. The RadGS-Reg framework introduces a novel approach for vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration using joint 3D Radiative Gaussians reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. The RadGS reconstruction module utilizes a learning-based approach with a Counterfactual Attention Learning mechanism to focus on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. A patient-specific pre-training strategy adapts the framework from simulated to real data while learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiment results on in-house datasets show superior performance compared to existing methods. The code for RadGS-Reg is available for reference. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT)/X-ray registration in image-guided navigation remains challenging because of its stringent requirements for high accuracy and real-time performance. Traditional "render and compare" methods, relying on iterative projection and comparison, suffer from spatial information loss and domain gap. 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-rays supplements spatial and shape information for 2D/3D registration, but current methods are limited by dense-view requirements and struggles with noisy X-rays. To address these limitations, we introduce RadGS-Reg, a novel framework for vertebral-level CT/X-ray registration through joint 3D Radiative Gaussians (RadGS) reconstruction and 3D/3D registration. Specifically, our biplanar X-rays vertebral RadGS reconstruction module explores learning-based RadGS reconstruction method with a Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) mechanism, focusing on vertebral regions in noisy X-rays. Additionally, a patient-specific pre-training strategy progressively adapts the RadGS-Reg from simulated to real data while simultaneously learning vertebral shape prior knowledge. Experiments on in-house datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance for both tasks, surpassing existing methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/shenao1995/RadGS_Reg.

Summary:
This study examines bias in evaluations of outputs from different language models, specifically ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude. The research identifies asymmetries in how the models' perceived identities impact evaluations, with labels significantly influencing scores. False labeling can reverse rankings and lead to drastic shifts in preference votes and quality ratings. True labels can affect model performance, with Gemini seeing a collapse in self-scores while Claude's self-preference intensifies. These findings highlight the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to ensure fairness in benchmarking large language models. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate outputs, yet their judgments may be influenced. This study examines bias in self- and cross-model evaluations by ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude under four conditions: no labels, true labels, and two false-label scenarios. Blog posts authored by each model were evaluated by all three using both overall preference voting and quality ratings for Coherence, Informativeness, and Conciseness, with all scores expressed as percentages for direct comparison. Results reveal striking asymmetries: the "Claude" label consistently boosts scores, while the "Gemini" label consistently depresses them, regardless of actual content. False labels frequently reversed rankings, producing shifts of up to 50 percentage points in preference votes and up to 12 percentage points in converted quality ratings. Gemini's self-scores collapsed under true labels, while Claude's self-preference intensified. These findings show that perceived model identity can heavily distort high-level judgments and subtly influence detailed quality ratings, underscoring the need for blind or multimodel evaluation protocols to ensure fairness in LLM benchmarking.

Abstract: Echo State Networks (ESNs) are a particular type of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the Reservoir Computing (RC) framework, popular for their fast and efficient learning. However, traditional ESNs often struggle with long-term information processing. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of deep untrained RNNs based on temporal residual connections, called Deep Residual Echo State Networks (DeepResESNs). We show that leveraging a hierarchy of untrained residual recurrent layers significantly boosts memory capacity and long-term temporal modeling. For the temporal residual connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN. Our experiments on a variety of time series tasks showcase the advantages of the proposed approach over traditional shallow and deep RC.

Abstract: Tree ensembles are widely recognized for their effectiveness in classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse domains, including bioinformatics, finance, and medical diagnosis. With increasing emphasis on data privacy and the \textit{right to be forgotten}, several unlearning algorithms have been proposed to enable tree ensembles to forget sensitive information. However, existing methods are often tailored to a particular model or rely on the discrete tree structure, making them difficult to generalize to complex ensembles and inefficient for large-scale datasets. To address these limitations, we propose FUTURE, a novel unlearning algorithm for tree ensembles. Specifically, we formulate the problem of forgetting samples as a gradient-based optimization task. In order to accommodate non-differentiability of tree ensembles, we adopt the probabilistic model approximations within the optimization framework. This enables end-to-end unlearning in an effective and efficient manner. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that FUTURE yields significant and successful unlearning performance.

Summary: 
The article introduces a method called BED-LLM, which uses Bayesian Experimental Design to enhance the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact intelligently with external sources. By iteratively selecting questions that maximize information gain, BED-LLM enables LLMs to act as effective conversational agents. The approach involves formulating the expected information gain using the LLM's belief distribution, incorporating specific innovations like a refined estimator and targeted query proposal strategy. Through tests involving the 20-questions game and user preference inference, BED-LLM demonstrates significant performance improvements over direct prompting and other adaptive design strategies. <div>

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments. Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's belief distribution and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction. Further key to the success of BED-LLM are a number of specific innovations, such as a carefully designed estimator for the EIG, not solely relying on in-context updates for conditioning on previous responses, and a targeted strategy for proposing candidate queries. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20-questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Summary: 
The article discusses decoding in large language models, presenting it as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex, with a focus on scoring tokens and normalizing using softmax. The discrete ascent is described as the multiplicative-weights update, with its continuous-time limit being the replicator flow. The study proves that the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium for a fixed context and temperature. The analysis also covers the effects of temperature, top-k, and nucleus sampling on the token distribution. Additionally, a controlled study of path-dependent score adjustments and their relation to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior is outlined. The article, however, does not address training dynamics or internal representations, leaving those aspects for future research. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Decoding in large language models is often described as scoring tokens and normalizing with softmax. We give a minimal, self-contained account of this step as a constrained variational principle on the probability simplex. The discrete, normalization-respecting ascent is the classical multiplicative-weights (entropic mirror) update; its continuous-time limit is the replicator flow. From these ingredients we prove that, for a fixed context and temperature, the next-token distribution follows a smooth trajectory inside the simplex and converges to the softmax equilibrium. This formalizes the common ``manifold traversal'' intuition at the output-distribution level. The analysis yields precise, practice-facing consequences: temperature acts as an exact rescaling of time along the same trajectory, while top-k and nucleus sampling restrict the flow to a face with identical guarantees. We also outline a controlled account of path-dependent score adjustments and their connection to loop-like, hallucination-style behavior.

Abstract: Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible.

<div> Keywords: autoregressive language models, orthographic attacks, pixel-based generative language model, multilingual text, robustness

Summary: 
Autoregressive language models face vulnerabilities due to orthographic attacks, where input text is altered with characters from various alphabets, resulting in performance decline. This issue arises from the out-of-vocabulary problem in subword tokenizers and their embeddings. To combat this challenge, a pixel-based generative language model is introduced, using pixel-based representations by rendering words as images instead of text-based embeddings. This approach enhances robustness against noisy inputs and supports multilingual text across diverse writing systems. The model is evaluated on datasets like LAMBADA, WMT24, and SST-2, showcasing its resilience to orthographic noise and effectiveness in multilingual scenarios. This innovative method marks a significant advancement in enhancing the security and performance of autoregressive language models.

Abstract: Autoregressive language models are vulnerable to orthographic attacks, where input text is perturbed with characters from multilingual alphabets, leading to substantial performance degradation. This vulnerability primarily stems from the out-of-vocabulary issue inherent in subword tokenizers and their embeddings. To address this limitation, we propose a pixel-based generative language model that replaces the text-based embeddings with pixel-based representations by rendering words as individual images. This design provides stronger robustness to noisy inputs, while an extension of compatibility to multilingual text across diverse writing systems. We evaluate the proposed method on the multilingual LAMBADA dataset, WMT24 dataset and the SST-2 benchmark, demonstrating both its resilience to orthographic noise and its effectiveness in multilingual settings.

<title>Generalizable Object Re-Identification via Visual In-Context Prompting</title>

Abstract: Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models (e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly labeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces annotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture \textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes Visual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on seen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only \textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter adaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer semantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through task-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\eg, DINO) to extract ID-discriminative features via \textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning LLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables generalization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific retraining. To support evaluation, we introduce ShopID10K, a dataset of 10K object instances from e-commerce platforms, featuring multi-view images and cross-domain testing. Experiments on ShopID10K and diverse ReID benchmarks demonstrate that VICP outperforms baselines by a clear margin on unseen categories. Code is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/VICP.

<title>Can Layer-wise SSL Features Improve Zero-Shot ASR Performance for Children's Speech?</title>

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle to accurately process children's speech due to its distinct and highly variable acoustic and linguistic characteristics. While recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) models have greatly enhanced the transcription of adult speech, accurately transcribing children's speech remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of layer-wise features extracted from state-of-the-art SSL pre-trained models - specifically, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, Data2Vec, and WavLM in improving the performance of ASR for children's speech in zero-shot scenarios. A detailed analysis of features extracted from these models was conducted, integrating them into a simplified DNN-based ASR system using the Kaldi toolkit. The analysis identified the most effective layers for enhancing ASR performance on children's speech in a zero-shot scenario, where WSJCAM0 adult speech was used for training and PFSTAR children speech for testing. Experimental results indicated that Layer 22 of the Wav2Vec2 model achieved the lowest Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.15%, representing a 51.64% relative improvement over the direct zero-shot decoding using Wav2Vec2 (WER of 10.65%). Additionally, age group-wise analysis demonstrated consistent performance improvements with increasing age, along with significant gains observed even in younger age groups using the SSL features. Further experiments on the CMU Kids dataset confirmed similar trends, highlighting the generalizability of the proposed approach.

<title>Decoding Memories: An Efficient Pipeline for Self-Consistency Hallucination Detection</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in both research and real-world applications, but they still struggle with hallucination. Existing hallucination detection methods often perform poorly on sentence-level generation or rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge. While self-consistency approaches help address these limitations, they incur high computational costs due to repeated generation. In this paper, we conduct the first study on identifying redundancy in self-consistency methods, manifested as shared prefix tokens across generations, and observe that non-exact-answer tokens contribute minimally to the semantic content. Based on these insights, we propose a novel Decoding Memory Pipeline (DMP) that accelerates generation through selective inference and annealed decoding. Being orthogonal to the model, dataset, decoding strategy, and self-consistency baseline, our DMP consistently improves the efficiency of multi-response generation and holds promise for extension to alignment and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves up to a 3x speedup without sacrificing AUROC performance.

Abstract: Transformers and State-Space Models (SSMs) have advanced audio classification by modeling spectrograms as sequences of patches. However, existing models such as the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST) and Audio Mamba (AuM) adopt square patching from computer vision, which disrupts continuous frequency patterns and produces an excessive number of patches, slowing training, and increasing computation. We propose Full-Frequency Temporal Patching (FFTP), a patching strategy that better matches the time-frequency asymmetry of spectrograms by spanning full frequency bands with localized temporal context, preserving harmonic structure, and significantly reducing patch count and computation. We also introduce SpecMask, a patch-aligned spectrogram augmentation that combines full-frequency and localized time-frequency masks under a fixed masking budget, enhancing temporal robustness while preserving spectral continuity. When applied on both AST and AuM, our patching method with SpecMask improves mAP by up to +6.76 on AudioSet-18k and accuracy by up to +8.46 on SpeechCommandsV2, while reducing computation by up to 83.26%, demonstrating both performance and efficiency gains.

Abstract: This study proposes an HCQA for designing optimal Quantum Sensor Circuits (QSCs) to address complex quantum physics problems. The HCQA integrates computational intelligence techniques by leveraging a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for learning and policy optimization, enhanced by a quantum-based action selection mechanism based on the Q-values. A quantum circuit encodes the agent current state using Ry gates, and then creates a superposition of possible actions. Measurement of the circuit results in probabilistic action outcomes, allowing the agent to generate optimal QSCs by selecting sequences of gates that maximize the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) while minimizing the number of gates. This computational intelligence-driven HCQA enables the automated generation of entangled quantum states, specifically the squeezed states, with high QFI sensitivity for quantum state estimation and control. Evaluation of the HCQA on a QSC that consists of two qubits and a sequence of Rx, Ry, and S gates demonstrates its efficiency in generating optimal QSCs with a QFI of 1. This work highlights the synergy between AI-driven learning and quantum computation, illustrating how intelligent agents can autonomously discover optimal quantum circuit designs for enhanced sensing and estimation tasks.

Abstract: Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance Keyword Spotting (KWS) in adult speech, but children's speech presents unique challenges for KWS systems due to its distinct acoustic and linguistic characteristics. This paper introduces a zero-shot KWS approach that leverages state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) models, including Wav2Vec2, HuBERT and Data2Vec. Features are extracted layer-wise from these SSL models and used to train a Kaldi-based DNN KWS system. The WSJCAM0 adult speech dataset was used for training, while the PFSTAR children's speech dataset was used for testing, demonstrating the zero-shot capability of our method. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art results across all keyword sets for children's speech. Notably, the Wav2Vec2 model, particularly layer 22, performed the best, delivering an ATWV score of 0.691, a MTWV score of 0.7003 and probability of false alarm and probability of miss of 0.0164 and 0.0547 respectively, for a set of 30 keywords. Furthermore, age-specific performance evaluation confirmed the system's effectiveness across different age groups of children. To assess the system's robustness against noise, additional experiments were conducted using the best-performing layer of the best-performing Wav2Vec2 model. The results demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional MFCC-based baseline, emphasizing the potential of SSL embeddings even in noisy conditions. To further generalize the KWS framework, the experiments were repeated for an additional CMU dataset. Overall the results highlight the significant contribution of SSL features in enhancing Zero-Shot KWS performance for children's speech, effectively addressing the challenges associated with the distinct characteristics of child speakers.

<title>A Mixture of Experts Gating Network for Enhanced Surrogate Modeling in External Aerodynamics</title>

Abstract: The computational cost associated with high-fidelity CFD simulations remains a significant bottleneck in the automotive design and optimization cycle. While ML-based surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative to accelerate aerodynamic predictions, the field is characterized by a diverse and rapidly evolving landscape of specialized neural network architectures, with no single model demonstrating universal superiority. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning framework that leverages this architectural diversity as a strength. We propose a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model that employs a dedicated gating network to dynamically and optimally combine the predictions from three heterogeneous, state-of-the-art surrogate models: DoMINO, a decomposable multi-scale neural operator; X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable multi-scale graph neural network; and FigConvNet, a factorized implicit global convolution network. The gating network learns a spatially-variant weighting strategy, assigning credibility to each expert based on its localized performance in predicting surface pressure and wall shear stress fields. To prevent model collapse and encourage balanced expert contributions, we integrate an entropy regularization term into the training loss function. The entire system is trained and validated on the DrivAerML dataset, a large-scale, public benchmark of high-fidelity CFD simulations for automotive aerodynamics. Quantitative results demonstrate that the MoE model achieves a significant reduction in L-2 prediction error, outperforming not only the ensemble average but also the most accurate individual expert model across all evaluated physical quantities. This work establishes the MoE framework as a powerful and effective strategy for creating more robust and accurate composite surrogate models by synergistically combining the complementary strengths of specialized architectures.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, optimizing quantum circuits for specific tasks is crucial for enhancing performance and efficiency. More recently, quantum sensing has become a distinct and rapidly growing branch of research within the area of quantum science and technology. The field is expected to provide new opportunities, especially regarding high sensitivity and precision. Entanglement is one of the key factors in achieving high sensitivity and measurement precision [3]. This paper presents a novel approach utilizing quantum machine learning techniques to optimize entanglement distribution in quantum sensor circuits. By leveraging reinforcement learning within a quantum environment, we aim to optimize the entanglement layout to maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy, which are key indicators of a quantum system's sensitivity and coherence, while minimizing circuit depth and gate counts. Our implementation, based on Qiskit, integrates noise models and error mitigation strategies to simulate realistic quantum environments. The results demonstrate significant improvements in circuit performance and sensitivity, highlighting the potential of machine learning in quantum circuit optimization by measuring high QFI and entropy in the range of 0.84-1.0 with depth and gate count reduction by 20-86%.

Abstract: As the number of qubits in a sensor increases, the complexity of designing and controlling the quantum circuits grows exponentially. Manually optimizing these circuits becomes infeasible. Optimizing entanglement distribution in large-scale quantum circuits is critical for enhancing the sensitivity and efficiency of quantum sensors [5], [6]. This paper presents an engineering integration of reinforcement learning with tensor-network-based simulation (MPS) for scalable circuit optimization for optimizing quantum sensor circuits with up to 60 qubits. To enable efficient simulation and scalability, we adopt tensor network methods, specifically the Matrix Product State (MPS) representation, instead of traditional state vector or density matrix approaches. Our reinforcement learning agent learns to restructure circuits to maximize Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and entanglement entropy while reducing gate counts and circuit depth. Experimental results show consistent improvements, with QFI values approaching 1, entanglement entropy in the 0.8-1.0 range, and up to 90% reduction in depth and gate count. These results highlight the potential of combining quantum machine learning and tensor networks to optimize complex quantum circuits under realistic constraints.

Abstract: Recommender systems struggle to provide accurate suggestions to new users with limited interaction history, a challenge known as the cold-user problem. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach using Double and Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to dynamically learn user preferences from sparse feedback, enhancing recommendation accuracy without relying on sensitive demographic data. By integrating these advanced DQN variants with a matrix factorization model, we achieve superior performance on a large e-commerce dataset compared to traditional methods like popularity-based and active learning strategies. Experimental results show that our method, particularly Dueling DQN, reduces Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for cold users, offering an effective solution for privacy-constrained environments.

Abstract: To reduce the amount of required labeled data for lung disease severity classification from chest X-rays (CXRs) under class imbalance, this study applied deep active learning with a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) approximation and weighted loss function. This retrospective study collected 2,319 CXRs from 963 patients (mean age, 59.2 $\pm$ 16.6 years; 481 female) at Emory Healthcare affiliated hospitals between January and November 2020. All patients had clinically confirmed COVID-19. Each CXR was independently labeled by 3 to 6 board-certified radiologists as normal, moderate, or severe. A deep neural network with Monte Carlo Dropout was trained using active learning to classify disease severity. Various acquisition functions were used to iteratively select the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AU ROC), and area under the precision-recall curve (AU PRC). Training time and acquisition time were recorded. Statistical analysis included descriptive metrics and performance comparisons across acquisition strategies. Entropy Sampling achieved 93.7% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.91) in binary classification (normal vs. diseased) using 15.4% of the training data. In the multi-class setting, Mean STD sampling achieved 70.3% accuracy (AU ROC, 0.86) using 23.1% of the labeled data. These methods outperformed more complex and computationally expensive acquisition functions and significantly reduced labeling needs. Deep active learning with BNN approximation and weighted loss effectively reduces labeled data requirements while addressing class imbalance, maintaining or exceeding diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to "brain scan" large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent, lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.

Abstract: Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the "wake" phase, the system rapidly learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory, G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the "sleep" phase, the system enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data ("dreams") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News) benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's effectiveness and domain-generality.

<title>Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing</title>

Abstract: Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs.
  We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.

Abstract: Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling, effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation tasks.

Abstract: Fairness in recommender systems (RSs) is commonly categorised into group fairness and individual fairness. However, there is no established scientific understanding of the relationship between the two fairness types, as prior work on both types has used different evaluation measures or evaluation objectives for each fairness type, thereby not allowing for a proper comparison of the two. As a result, it is currently not known how increasing one type of fairness may affect the other. To fill this gap, we study the relationship of group and individual fairness through a comprehensive comparison of evaluation measures that can be used for both fairness types. Our experiments with 8 runs across 3 datasets show that recommendations that are highly fair for groups can be very unfair for individuals. Our finding is novel and useful for RS practitioners aiming to improve the fairness of their systems. Our code is available at: https://github.com/theresiavr/stairway-to-fairness.

<title>DLGAN : Time Series Synthesis Based on Dual-Layer Generative Adversarial Networks</title>

Abstract: Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named \textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First, these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: In the era of large-scale neural network models, optimization algorithms often struggle with generalization due to an overreliance on training loss. One key insight widely accepted in the machine learning community is the idea that wide basins (regions around a local minimum where the loss increases gradually) promote better generalization by offering greater stability to small changes in input data or model parameters. In contrast, sharp minima are typically more sensitive and less stable. Motivated by two key empirical observations - the inherent heavy-tailed distribution of gradient noise in stochastic gradient descent and the Edge of Stability phenomenon during neural network training, in which curvature grows before settling at a plateau, we introduce Adaptive Heavy Tailed Stochastic Gradient Descent (AHTSGD). The algorithm injects heavier-tailed noise into the optimizer during the early stages of training to enhance exploration and gradually transitions to lighter-tailed noise as sharpness stabilizes. By dynamically adapting to the sharpness of the loss landscape throughout training, AHTSGD promotes accelerated convergence to wide basins. AHTSGD is the first algorithm to adjust the nature of injected noise into an optimizer based on the Edge of Stability phenomenon. AHTSGD consistently outperforms SGD and other noise-based methods on benchmarks like MNIST and CIFAR-10, with marked gains on noisy datasets such as SVHN. It ultimately accelerates early training from poor initializations and improves generalization across clean and noisy settings, remaining robust to learning rate choices.

Abstract: The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10 billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1) modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders' actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance of decentralized, tokenized economies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming AI across industries, but their development and deployment remain complex. This survey reviews 16 key challenges in building and using LLMs and examines how these challenges are addressed by two state-of-the-art models with unique approaches: OpenAI's closed source GPT-4o (May 2024 update) and DeepSeek-V3-0324 (March 2025), a large open source Mixture-of-Experts model. Through this comparison, we showcase the trade-offs between closed source models (robust safety, fine-tuned reliability) and open source models (efficiency, adaptability). We also explore LLM applications across different domains (from chatbots and coding tools to healthcare and education), highlighting which model attributes are best suited for each use case. This article aims to guide AI researchers, developers, and decision-makers in understanding current LLM capabilities, limitations, and best practices.

<title>RoboInspector: Unveiling the Unreliability of Policy Code for LLM-enabled Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

Abstract: Do neural networks build their representations through smooth, gradual refinement, or via more complex computational processes? We investigate this by extending the logit lens to analyze the policy network of Leela Chess Zero, a superhuman chess engine. We find strong monotonic trends in playing strength and puzzle-solving ability across layers, yet policy distributions frequently follow non-smooth trajectories. Evidence for this includes correct puzzle solutions that are discovered early but subsequently discarded, move rankings that remain poorly correlated with final outputs, and high policy divergence until late in the network. These findings contrast with the smooth distributional convergence typically observed in language models.

<title>Normality and the Turing Test</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes to revisit the Turing test through the concept of normality. Its core argument is that the statistical interpretation of the normal--understood as the average both in the normative and mathematical sense of the term--proves useful for understanding the Turing test in at least two ways. First, in the sense that the Turing test targets normal/average rather than exceptional human intelligence, so that successfully passing the test requires building machines that "make mistakes" and display imperfect behavior just like normal/average humans. Second, in the sense that the Turing test is a statistical test where judgments of intelligence are never carried out by a single "average" judge (understood as non-expert) but always by a full jury. As such, the notion of "average human interrogator" that Turing talks about in his original paper should be understood primarily as referring to a mathematical abstraction made of the normalized aggregate of individual judgments of multiple judges. In short, this paper argues that the Turing test is a test of normal intelligence as assessed by a normal judge characterizing the average judgment of a pool of human interrogators. Its conclusions are twofold. First, it argues that large language models such as ChatGPT are unlikely to pass the Turing test as those models precisely target exceptional rather than normal/average human intelligence. As such, they constitute models of what it proposes to call artificial smartness rather than artificial intelligence per se. Second, it argues that the core question of whether the Turing test can contribute anything to the understanding of human cognition is that of whether the human mind is really reducible to the normal/average mind--a question which largely extends beyond the Turing test itself and questions the conceptual underpinnings of the normalist paradigm it belongs to.

Abstract: This paper investigates reproducibility challenges in automatic text summarization evaluation. Based on experiments conducted across six representative metrics ranging from classical approaches like ROUGE to recent LLM-based methods (G-Eval, SEval-Ex), we highlight significant discrepancies between reported performances in the literature and those observed in our experimental setting. We introduce a unified, open-source framework, applied to the SummEval dataset and designed to support fair and transparent comparison of evaluation metrics. Our results reveal a structural trade-off: metrics with the highest alignment with human judgments tend to be computationally intensive and less stable across runs. Beyond comparative analysis, this study highlights key concerns about relying on LLMs for evaluation, stressing their randomness, technical dependencies, and limited reproducibility. We advocate for more robust evaluation protocols including exhaustive documentation and methodological standardization to ensure greater reliability in automatic summarization assessment.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for adapting them to specific tasks, yet it remains computationally demanding and raises concerns about correctness and privacy, particularly in untrusted environments. Although parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) significantly reduce resource requirements, ensuring the security and verifiability of fine-tuning under zero-knowledge constraints remains an unresolved challenge. To address this, we introduce zkLoRA, the first framework to integrate LoRA fine-tuning with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), achieving provable security and correctness. zkLoRA employs advanced cryptographic techniques -- such as lookup arguments, sumcheck protocols, and polynomial commitments -- to verify both arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations in Transformer-based architectures. The framework provides end-to-end verifiability for forward propagation, backward propagation, and parameter updates during LoRA fine-tuning, while safeguarding the privacy of model parameters and training data. Leveraging GPU-based implementations, zkLoRA demonstrates practicality and efficiency through experimental validation on open-source LLMs like LLaMA, scaling up to 13 billion parameters. By combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning with ZKPs, zkLoRA bridges a critical gap, enabling secure and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in sensitive or untrusted environments.

<title>DRASP: A Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling Framework for Automatic MOS Prediction</title>

Abstract: A pooling mechanism is essential for mean opinion score (MOS) prediction, facilitating the transformation of variable-length audio features into a concise fixed-size representation that effectively encodes speech quality. Existing pooling methods typically operate at a singular granularity, concentrating either on a comprehensive global perspective or a detailed frame-level analysis, which may overlook complementary perceptual insights. To address this limitation, we introduce the Dual-Resolution Attentive Statistics Pooling (DRASP) framework. DRASP integrates both coarse-grained, global statistical summaries and fine-grained, attentive analyses of perceptually significant segments. This dual-view architecture empowers our model to formulate a more thorough and robust representation, capturing both the overarching structural context and salient local details concurrently. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and strong generalization ability of the proposed framework. It consistently outperforms various baseline methods across diverse datasets (MusicEval and AES-Natural), MOS prediction backbones (including a CLAP-based model and AudioBox-Aesthetics), and different audio generation systems, achieving a relative improvement of 10.39% in system-level Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) over the widely-used average pooling approach.

Abstract: Using data from mobile network utilization in Norway, we showcase the possibility of monitoring the state of communication and mobility networks with a non-invasive, low-cost method. This method transforms the network data into a model within the framework of reservoir computing and then measures the model's performance on proxy tasks. Experimentally, we show how the performance on these proxies relates to the state of the network. A key advantage of this approach is that it uses readily available data sets and leverages the reservoir computing framework for an inexpensive and largely agnostic method. Data from mobile network utilization is available in an anonymous, aggregated form with multiple snapshots per day. This data can be treated like a weighted network. Reservoir computing allows the use of weighted, but untrained networks as a machine learning tool. The network, initialized as a so-called echo state network (ESN), projects incoming signals into a higher dimensional space, on which a single trained layer operates. This consumes less energy than deep neural networks in which every weight of the network is trained. We use neuroscience inspired tasks and trained our ESN model to solve them. We then show how the performance depends on certain network configurations and also how it visibly decreases when perturbing the network. While this work serves as proof of concept, we believe it can be elevated to be used for near-real-time monitoring as well as the identification of possible weak spots of both mobile communication networks as well as transportation networks.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold significant potential in medical applications, including disease diagnosis and clinical decision-making. However, these tasks require highly accurate, context-sensitive, and professionally aligned responses, making reliable reward models and judges critical. Despite their importance, medical reward models (MRMs) and judges remain underexplored, with no dedicated benchmarks addressing clinical requirements. Existing benchmarks focus on general MLLM capabilities or evaluate models as solvers, neglecting essential evaluation dimensions like diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance. To address this, we introduce Med-RewardBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate MRMs and judges in medical scenarios. Med-RewardBench features a multimodal dataset spanning 13 organ systems and 8 clinical departments, with 1,026 expert-annotated cases. A rigorous three-step process ensures high-quality evaluation data across six clinically critical dimensions. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including open-source, proprietary, and medical-specific models, revealing substantial challenges in aligning outputs with expert judgment. Additionally, we develop baseline models that demonstrate substantial performance improvements through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility

Abstract: Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models, but significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical settings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation between synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging discrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue representation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative model based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables high-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior approaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data, MedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless translation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce X-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays under varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models. Experimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared to diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains flexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual fidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable solution for domain adaptation in medical imaging. The code and dataset are available at https://caetas.github.io/medshift.html

Abstract: In click-through rate prediction, click-through rate prediction is used to model users' interests. However, most of the existing CTR prediction methods are mainly based on the ID modality. As a result, they are unable to comprehensively model users' multi-modal preferences. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce multi-modal CTR prediction. Although it seems appealing to directly apply the existing multi-modal fusion methods to click-through rate prediction models, these methods (1) fail to effectively disentangle commonalities and specificities across different modalities; (2) fail to consider the synergistic effects between modalities and model the complex interactions between modalities.
  To address the above issues, this paper proposes the Diffusion-based Multi-modal Synergy Interest Network (Diff-MSIN) framework for click-through prediction. This framework introduces three innovative modules: the Multi-modal Feature Enhancement (MFE) Module Synergistic Relationship Capture (SRC) Module, and the Feature Dynamic Adaptive Fusion (FDAF) Module. The MFE Module and SRC Module extract synergistic, common, and special information among different modalities. They effectively enhances the representation of the modalities, improving the overall quality of the fusion. To encourage distinctiveness among different features, we design a Knowledge Decoupling method. Additionally, the FDAF Module focuses on capturing user preferences and reducing fusion noise. To validate the effectiveness of the Diff-MSIN framework, we conducted extensive experiments using the Rec-Tmall and three Amazon datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach yields a significant improvement of at least 1.67% compared to the baseline, highlighting its potential for enhancing multi-modal recommendation systems. Our code is available at the following link: https://github.com/Cxx-0/Diff-MSIN.

Abstract: Recent advances in Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) have leveraged generative models for 3D molecular generation, predominantly evaluating model performance by binding affinity to target proteins. However, practical drug discovery necessitates high binding affinity along with synthetic feasibility and selectivity, critical properties that were largely neglected in previous evaluations. To address this gap, we identify fundamental limitations of conventional diffusion-based generative models in effectively guiding molecule generation toward these diverse pharmacological properties. We propose CByG, a novel framework extending Bayesian Flow Network into a gradient-based conditional generative model that robustly integrates property-specific guidance. Additionally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme incorporating practical benchmarks for binding affinity, synthetic feasibility, and selectivity, overcoming the limitations of conventional evaluation methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed CByG framework significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple essential evaluation criteria, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world drug discovery applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable creative writing capabilities, yet their substantial computational demands hinder widespread use. Enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) offers a promising alternative, but current methods like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with novelty, and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is costly. This paper explores two distinct AI-driven reward strategies within a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to ignite the creative writing of a 7B-parameter SLM, specifically for generating Chinese greetings. The first strategy employs a RM trained on high-quality preference data curated by a novel multi-agent rejection sampling framework designed for creative tasks. The second, more novel strategy utilizes a principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge, whose reward function is optimized via an adversarial training scheme with a reflection mechanism, to directly provide reward signals. Comprehensive experiments reveal that while both approaches significantly enhance creative output over baselines, the principle-guided LLM-as-a-Judge demonstrably yields superior generation quality. Furthermore, it offers notable advantages in training efficiency and reduced dependency on human-annotated data, presenting a more scalable and effective path towards creative SLMs. Our automated evaluation methods also exhibit strong alignment with human judgments.

Abstract: Psychological biases, such as confirmation bias, make individuals particularly vulnerable to believing and spreading fake news on social media, leading to significant consequences in domains such as public health and politics. Machine learning-based fact-checking systems have been widely studied to mitigate this problem. Among them, ensemble methods are particularly effective in combining multiple classifiers to improve robustness. However, their performance heavily depends on the diversity of the constituent classifiers-selecting genuinely diverse models remains a key challenge, especially when models tend to learn redundant patterns. In this work, we propose a novel automatic classifier selection approach that prioritizes diversity, also extended by performance. The method first computes pairwise diversity between classifiers and applies hierarchical clustering to organize them into groups at different levels of granularity. A HierarchySelect then explores these hierarchical levels to select one pool of classifiers per level, each representing a distinct intra-pool diversity. The most diverse pool is identified and selected for ensemble construction from these. The selection process incorporates an evaluation metric reflecting each classifiers's performance to ensure the ensemble also generalises well. We conduct experiments with 40 heterogeneous classifiers across six datasets from different application domains and with varying numbers of classes. Our method is compared against the Elbow heuristic and state-of-the-art baselines. Results show that our approach achieves the highest accuracy on two of six datasets. The implementation details are available on the project's repository: https://github.com/SaraBCoutinho/HSFN .

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification in reinforcement learning can greatly improve exploration and robustness. Approximate Bayesian approaches have recently been popularized to quantify uncertainty in model-free algorithms. However, so far the focus has been on improving the accuracy of the posterior approximation, instead of studying the accuracy of the prior and likelihood assumptions underlying the posterior. In this work, we demonstrate that there is a cold posterior effect in Bayesian deep Q-learning, where contrary to theory, performance increases when reducing the temperature of the posterior. To identify and overcome likely causes, we challenge common assumptions made on the likelihood and priors in Bayesian model-free algorithms. We empirically study prior distributions and show through statistical tests that the common Gaussian likelihood assumption is frequently violated. We argue that developing more suitable likelihoods and priors should be a key focus in future Bayesian reinforcement learning research and we offer simple, implementable solutions for better priors in deep Q-learning that lead to more performant Bayesian algorithms.

<title>ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs. Previous video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They attribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing frames, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these causes indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still oversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect outputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of hallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during the process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic groups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to increased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to separate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination. To address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark dedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of SAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases with semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to SAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to mitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to alleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability to distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a dataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both ELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.

<title>On the Hardness of Learning GNN-based SAT Solvers: The Role of Graph Ricci Curvature</title>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently shown promise as solvers for Boolean Satisfiability Problems (SATs) by operating on graph representations of logical formulas. However, their performance degrades sharply on harder instances, raising the question of whether this reflects fundamental architectural limitations. In this work, we provide a geometric explanation through the lens of graph Ricci Curvature (RC), which quantifies local connectivity bottlenecks. We prove that bipartite graphs derived from random k-SAT formulas are inherently negatively curved, and that this curvature decreases with instance difficulty. Building on this, we show that GNN-based SAT solvers are affected by oversquashing, a phenomenon where long-range dependencies become impossible to compress into fixed-length representations. We validate our claims empirically across different SAT benchmarks and confirm that curvature is both a strong indicator of problem complexity and can be used to predict performance. Finally, we connect our findings to design principles of existing solvers and outline promising directions for future work.

<title>Complete Gaussian Splats from a Single Image with Denoising Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Gaussian splatting typically requires dense observations of the scene and can fail to reconstruct occluded and unobserved areas. We propose a latent diffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats, including the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference. Completing the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the ambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a regression-based formulation to predict a single "mode" for occluded and out-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to capture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem partially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background, reconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the input views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a distribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single input image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a Variational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a self-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method generates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to complete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.

<title>What Data is Really Necessary? A Feasibility Study of Inference Data Minimization for Recommender Systems</title>

Abstract: Data minimization is a legal principle requiring personal data processing to be limited to what is necessary for a specified purpose. Operationalizing this principle for recommender systems, which rely on extensive personal data, remains a significant challenge. This paper conducts a feasibility study on minimizing implicit feedback inference data for such systems. We propose a novel problem formulation, analyze various minimization techniques, and investigate key factors influencing their effectiveness. We demonstrate that substantial inference data reduction is technically feasible without significant performance loss. However, its practicality is critically determined by two factors: the technical setting (e.g., performance targets, choice of model) and user characteristics (e.g., history size, preference complexity). Thus, while we establish its technical feasibility, we conclude that data minimization remains practically challenging and its dependence on the technical and user context makes a universal standard for data `necessity' difficult to implement.

<title>EZ-Sort: Efficient Pairwise Comparison via Zero-Shot CLIP-Based Pre-Ordering and Human-in-the-Loop Sorting</title>

Abstract: Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden (O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n = 100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) present a transformative approach for smart grid modeling by integrating physical laws directly into learning frameworks, addressing critical challenges of data scarcity and physical consistency in conventional data-driven methods. This paper evaluates PINNs' capabilities as surrogate models for smart grid dynamics, comparing their performance against XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression across three key experiments: interpolation, cross-validation, and episodic trajectory prediction. By training PINNs exclusively through physics-based loss functions (enforcing power balance, operational constraints, and grid stability) we demonstrate their superior generalization, outperforming data-driven models in error reduction. Notably, PINNs maintain comparatively lower MAE in dynamic grid operations, reliably capturing state transitions in both random and expert-driven control scenarios, while traditional models exhibit erratic performance. Despite slight degradation in extreme operational regimes, PINNs consistently enforce physical feasibility, proving vital for safety-critical applications. Our results contribute to establishing PINNs as a paradigm-shifting tool for smart grid surrogation, bridging data-driven flexibility with first-principles rigor. This work advances real-time grid control and scalable digital twins, emphasizing the necessity of physics-aware architectures in mission-critical energy systems.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are artificial neural networks based on simulated biological neurons and have attracted much attention in recent artificial intelligence technology studies. The dendrites in biological neurons have efficient information processing ability and computational power; however, the neurons of SNNs rarely match the complex structure of the dendrites. Inspired by the nonlinear structure and highly sparse properties of neuronal dendrites, in this study, we propose an efficient, lightweight SNN method with nonlinear pruning and dendritic integration (NSPDI-SNN). In this method, we introduce nonlinear dendritic integration (NDI) to improve the representation of the spatiotemporal information of neurons. We implement heterogeneous state transition ratios of dendritic spines and construct a new and flexible nonlinear synaptic pruning (NSP) method to achieve the high sparsity of SNN. We conducted systematic experiments on three benchmark datasets (DVS128 Gesture, CIFAR10-DVS, and CIFAR10) and extended the evaluation to two complex tasks (speech recognition and reinforcement learning-based maze navigation task). Across all tasks, NSPDI-SNN consistently achieved high sparsity with minimal performance degradation. In particular, our method achieved the best experimental results on all three event stream datasets. Further analysis showed that NSPDI significantly improved the efficiency of synaptic information transfer as sparsity increased. In conclusion, our results indicate that the complex structure and nonlinear computation of neuronal dendrites provide a promising approach for developing efficient SNN methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of textual data containing sensitive personal information across various domains requires robust anonymization techniques to protect privacy and comply with regulations, while preserving data usability for diverse and crucial downstream tasks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of current trends and recent advances in text anonymization techniques. We begin by discussing foundational approaches, primarily centered on Named Entity Recognition, before examining the transformative impact of Large Language Models, detailing their dual role as sophisticated anonymizers and potent de-anonymization threats. The survey further explores domain-specific challenges and tailored solutions in critical sectors such as healthcare, law, finance, and education. We investigate advanced methodologies incorporating formal privacy models and risk-aware frameworks, and address the specialized subfield of authorship anonymization. Additionally, we review evaluation frameworks, comprehensive metrics, benchmarks, and practical toolkits for real-world deployment of anonymization solutions. This review consolidates current knowledge, identifies emerging trends and persistent challenges, including the evolving privacy-utility trade-off, the need to address quasi-identifiers, and the implications of LLM capabilities, and aims to guide future research directions for both academics and practitioners in this field.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) Large Language Models (LLM) fundamentally rely on high-quality training data. While data selection and data synthesis are two common strategies to improve data quality, existing approaches often face limitations in static dataset curation that fail to adapt to evolving model capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Middo, a self-evolving Model-informed dynamic data optimization framework that uses model-aware data selection and context-preserving data refinement. Unlike conventional one-off filtering/synthesis methods, our framework establishes a closed-loop optimization system: (1) A self-referential diagnostic module proactively identifies suboptimal samples through tri-axial model signals - loss patterns (complexity), embedding cluster dynamics (diversity), and self-alignment scores (quality); (2) An adaptive optimization engine then transforms suboptimal samples into pedagogically valuable training points while preserving semantic integrity; (3) This optimization process continuously evolves with model capability through dynamic learning principles. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our \method consistently enhances the quality of seed data and boosts LLM's performance with improving accuracy by 7.15% on average while maintaining the original dataset scale. This work establishes a new paradigm for sustainable LLM training through dynamic human-AI co-evolution of data and models. Our datasets, models, and code are coming soon.

Abstract: We present QZhou-Embedding, a general-purpose contextual text embedding model with exceptional text representation capabilities. Built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model, we designed a unified multi-task framework comprising specialized data transformation and training strategies. The data transformation scheme enables the incorporation of more diverse textual training datasets, while the task-specific training strategies enhance model learning efficiency. We developed a data synthesis pipeline leveraging LLM API, incorporating techniques such as paraphrasing, augmentation, and hard negative example generation to improve the semantic richness and sample difficulty of the training set. Additionally, we employ a two-stage training strategy, comprising initial retrieval-focused pretraining followed by full-task fine-tuning, enabling the embedding model to extend its capabilities based on robust retrieval performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on the MTEB and CMTEB benchmarks, ranking first on both leaderboards (August 27 2025), and simultaneously achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including reranking, clustering, etc. Our findings demonstrate that higher-quality, more diverse data is crucial for advancing retrieval model performance, and that leveraging LLMs generative capabilities can further optimize data quality for embedding model breakthroughs. Our model weights are released on HuggingFace under Apache 2.0 license. For reproducibility, we provide evaluation code and instructions on GitHub.

Abstract: Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each character and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character segmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in sequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first detecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly output full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of language models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe that the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word segmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical progression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to bypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for better utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not only improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough literature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark such shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a meticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level annotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy improvement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning towards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4 times improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With continuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds potential to exploit such advances. Project Website: https://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern computer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image recognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input modifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However, existing detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network architecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that adversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in CNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using parallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs consistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers, enabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates below 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy distributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their activation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed through activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of self-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time without compromising original model performance.

Abstract: Watermarking diffusion-generated images is crucial for copyright protection and user tracking. However, current diffusion watermarking methods face significant limitations: zero-bit watermarking systems lack the capacity for large-scale user tracking, while multi-bit methods are highly sensitive to certain image transformations or generative attacks, resulting in a lack of comprehensive robustness. In this paper, we propose OptMark, an optimization-based approach that embeds a robust multi-bit watermark into the intermediate latents of the diffusion denoising process. OptMark strategically inserts a structural watermark early to resist generative attacks and a detail watermark late to withstand image transformations, with tailored regularization terms to preserve image quality and ensure imperceptibility. To address the challenge of memory consumption growing linearly with the number of denoising steps during optimization, OptMark incorporates adjoint gradient methods, reducing memory usage from O(N) to O(1). Experimental results demonstrate that OptMark achieves invisible multi-bit watermarking while ensuring robust resilience against valuemetric transformations, geometric transformations, editing, and regeneration attacks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue, however, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital Measurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving clutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in head-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by these limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data generation tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks involving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and high-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled synthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present DMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images designed to evaluate model performance under practical constraints. Benchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein Similarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with CAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL showcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This demonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the robustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated challenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as open-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the community to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer perception (CP) technologies use mobile sensors to collect behavioral and physiological data for clinical decision-making. These tools can reshape how clinical knowledge is generated and interpreted. However, effective integration of these tools into clinical workflows depends on how developers balance clinical utility with user acceptability and trustworthiness. Our study presents findings from 20 in-depth interviews with developers of AI-based CP tools. Interviews were transcribed and inductive, thematic analysis was performed to identify 4 key design priorities: 1) to account for context and ensure explainability for both patients and clinicians; 2) align tools with existing clinical workflows; 3) appropriately customize to relevant stakeholders for usability and acceptability; and 4) push the boundaries of innovation while aligning with established paradigms. Our findings highlight that developers view themselves as not merely technical architects but also ethical stewards, designing tools that are both acceptable by users and epistemically responsible (prioritizing objectivity and pushing clinical knowledge forward). We offer the following suggestions to help achieve this balance: documenting how design choices around customization are made, defining limits for customization choices, transparently conveying information about outputs, and investing in user training. Achieving these goals will require interdisciplinary collaboration between developers, clinicians, and ethicists.

Abstract: The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines the process of converting Python-based neural network models into SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.

Abstract: AI researchers and practitioners increasingly apply large language models (LLMs) to what we call reasoning-intensive regression (RiR), i.e. deducing subtle numerical properties from text. Unlike standard language regression tasks, e.g. for sentiment or similarity, RiR often appears instead in ad-hoc problems like rubric-based scoring or domain-specific retrieval, where much deeper analysis of text is required while only limited task-specific training data and computation are available. We cast three realistic problems as RiR tasks to establish an initial benchmark, and use that to test our hypothesis that prompting frozen LLMs and finetuning Transformer encoders via gradient descent will both often struggle in RiR. We then propose MENTAT, a simple and lightweight method that combines batch-reflective prompt optimization with neural ensemble learning. MENTAT achieves up to 65% improvement over both baselines, though substantial room remains for future advances in RiR.

Abstract: We propose a realistic scenario for the unsupervised video learning where neither task boundaries nor labels are provided when learning a succession of tasks. We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the under-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos represent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in many applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in unsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised continual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries, while having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we study the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more challenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of processing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark experimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured video data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised video transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of the data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task data, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture new knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of transfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge transfer to the current learning task. We found that the proposed methodology substantially enhances the performance of the model when successively learning many tasks. We perform in-depth evaluations on three standard video action recognition datasets, including UCF101, HMDB51, and Something-to-Something V2, without using any labels or class boundaries.

<title>Benchmarking GPT-5 in Radiation Oncology: Measurable Gains, but Persistent Need for Expert Oversight</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21777</link>

Abstract: Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in clinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been specifically marketed towards oncology use.
  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the ACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300 multiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation oncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment indications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate concise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated correctness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was quantified using Fleiss' \k{appa}.
  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%, outperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were most pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's treatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95% CI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69). Hallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their presence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \k{appa} 0.083 for correctness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors clustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed clinical adaptation.
  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation oncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable performance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment recommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement. While hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors underscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert oversight before clinical implementation.

Abstract: Best-of-n sampling improves the accuracy of large language models (LLMs) and large reasoning models (LRMs) by generating multiple candidate solutions and selecting the one with the highest reward. The key challenge for reasoning tasks is designing a scoring function that can identify correct reasoning chains without access to ground-truth answers. We propose Probabilistic Confidence Selection And Ranking (PiCSAR): a simple, training-free method that scores each candidate generation using the joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer. The joint log-likelihood of the reasoning and final answer naturally decomposes into reasoning confidence and answer confidence. PiCSAR achieves substantial gains across diverse benchmarks (+10.18 on MATH500, +9.81 on AIME2025), outperforming baselines with at least 2x fewer samples in 16 out of 20 comparisons. Our analysis reveals that correct reasoning chains exhibit significantly higher reasoning and answer confidence, justifying the effectiveness of PiCSAR.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely heavily on web-scale datasets like Common Crawl, which provides over 80\% of training data for some modern models. However, the indiscriminate nature of web crawling raises challenges in data quality, safety, and ethics. Despite the critical importance of training data quality, prior research on harmful content has been limited to small samples due to computational constraints. This project presents a framework for indexing and analyzing LLM training datasets using an ElasticSearch-based pipeline. We apply it to SwissAI's FineWeb-2 corpus (1.5TB, four languages), achieving fast query performance--most searches in milliseconds, all under 2 seconds. Our work demonstrates real-time dataset analysis, offering practical tools for safer, more accountable AI systems.

<title>MoE-Health: A Mixture of Experts Framework for Robust Multimodal Healthcare Prediction</title>

Abstract: Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous data availability.

Abstract: Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal patterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available. Unlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image feature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between objects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical anomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified structural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level text memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text extractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input images. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves complete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third, we employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for constructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These three complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images that are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple levels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and logical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving industrial and medical domains. The model and code are available at https://github.com/SIA-IDE/TMUAD.

<title>DynaMark: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Dynamic Watermarking in Industrial Machine Tool Controllers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Industry 4.0's highly networked Machine Tool Controllers (MTCs) are prime targets for replay attacks that use outdated sensor data to manipulate actuators. Dynamic watermarking can reveal such tampering, but current schemes assume linear-Gaussian dynamics and use constant watermark statistics, making them vulnerable to the time-varying, partly proprietary behavior of MTCs. We close this gap with DynaMark, a reinforcement learning framework that models dynamic watermarking as a Markov decision process (MDP). It learns an adaptive policy online that dynamically adapts the covariance of a zero-mean Gaussian watermark using available measurements and detector feedback, without needing system knowledge. DynaMark maximizes a unique reward function balancing control performance, energy consumption, and detection confidence dynamically. We develop a Bayesian belief updating mechanism for real-time detection confidence in linear systems. This approach, independent of specific system assumptions, underpins the MDP for systems with linear dynamics. On a Siemens Sinumerik 828D controller digital twin, DynaMark achieves a reduction in watermark energy by 70% while preserving the nominal trajectory, compared to constant variance baselines. It also maintains an average detection delay equivalent to one sampling interval. A physical stepper-motor testbed validates these findings, rapidly triggering alarms with less control performance decline and exceeding existing benchmarks.

Abstract: Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events and their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model must first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify the participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling), and finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization). Existing methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we show through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address the inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories may reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key contributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb classification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous semantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of fully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to reformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning (SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a comprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully designed to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To address the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb Multilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to capture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more than 3\% MAP improvement while remaining competitive on traditional top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics.

Abstract: Pre-training with offline data and online fine-tuning using reinforcement learning is a promising strategy for learning control policies by leveraging the best of both worlds in terms of sample efficiency and performance. One natural approach is to initialize the policy for online learning with the one trained offline. In this work, we introduce a policy expansion scheme for this task. After learning the offline policy, we use it as one candidate policy in a policy set. We then expand the policy set with another policy which will be responsible for further learning. The two policies will be composed in an adaptive manner for interacting with the environment. With this approach, the policy previously learned offline is fully retained during online learning, thus mitigating the potential issues such as destroying the useful behaviors of the offline policy in the initial stage of online learning while allowing the offline policy participate in the exploration naturally in an adaptive manner. Moreover, new useful behaviors can potentially be captured by the newly added policy through learning. Experiments are conducted on a number of tasks and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code is available at https://github.com/Haichao-Zhang/PEX

Abstract: Deriving personalized insights from popular wearable trackers requires complex numerical reasoning that challenges standard LLMs, necessitating tool-based approaches like code generation. Large language model (LLM) agents present a promising yet largely untapped solution for this analysis at scale. We introduce the Personal Health Insights Agent (PHIA), a system leveraging multistep reasoning with code generation and information retrieval to analyze and interpret behavioral health data. To test its capabilities, we create and share two benchmark datasets with over 4000 health insights questions. A 650-hour human expert evaluation shows that PHIA significantly outperforms a strong code generation baseline, achieving 84% accuracy on objective, numerical questions and, for open-ended ones, earning 83% favorable ratings while being twice as likely to achieve the highest quality rating. This work can advance behavioral health by empowering individuals to understand their data, enabling a new era of accessible, personalized, and data-driven wellness for the wider population.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is a technique that enhances Large Language Model (LLM) inference in tasks like Question Answering (QA) by retrieving relevant information from knowledge graphs (KGs). However, real-world KGs are often incomplete, meaning that essential information for answering questions may be missing. Existing benchmarks do not adequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In this paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by removing triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects. We demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness, highlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.

Abstract: Mathematical geometric problem solving (GPS) demands verifiable logical coherence and multimodal reasoning capabilities. While large language models (LLMs) have shown rapid progress in GPS, their advancement is hindered by the lack of reliable benchmarks and systematic methodologies. A critical challenge is the inherent hallucination in LLMs, which leads to synthetic GPS datasets that are often noisy, unverified, and self-contradictory. To address this, we introduce TrustGeoGen, a data engine that generates formally verified geometric problems to establish a principled and trustworthy benchmark. Our engine integrates four key innovations: 1) Multimodal Alignment, which synchronizes the generation of diagrams, text, and step-by-step solutions; 2) Formal Verification, ensuring all reasoning paths are rule-compliant; 3) Connection Thinking, bridging formal deduction with human-like logical steps; and 4) our \textit{GeoExplore} series algorithms, which produce diverse problem variants with multiple solutions and self-reflective backtracking. Using this engine, we create the GeoTrust-200K dataset and the corresponding GeoTrust-test benchmark, both with guaranteed cross-modal integrity. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art models achieve only 45.83\% accuracy on GeoTrust-test, highlighting its significant challenge. Furthermore, training on our synthesized data substantially improves model performance on GPS tasks, with strong generalization to out-of-domain (OOD) benchmarks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Alpha-Innovator/TrustGeoGen

Abstract: Probabilistic graphical models that encode indistinguishable objects and relations among them use first-order logic constructs to compress a propositional factorised model for more efficient (lifted) inference. To obtain a lifted representation, the state-of-the-art algorithm Advanced Colour Passing (ACP) groups factors that represent matching distributions. In an approximate version using $\varepsilon$ as a hyperparameter, factors are grouped that differ by a factor of at most $(1\pm \varepsilon)$. However, finding a suitable $\varepsilon$ is not obvious and may need a lot of exploration, possibly requiring many ACP runs with different $\varepsilon$ values. Additionally, varying $\varepsilon$ can yield wildly different models, leading to decreased interpretability. Therefore, this paper presents a hierarchical approach to lifted model construction that is hyperparameter-free. It efficiently computes a hierarchy of $\varepsilon$ values that ensures a hierarchy of models, meaning that once factors are grouped together given some $\varepsilon$, these factors will be grouped together for larger $\varepsilon$ as well. The hierarchy of $\varepsilon$ values also leads to a hierarchy of error bounds. This allows for explicitly weighing compression versus accuracy when choosing specific $\varepsilon$ values to run ACP with and enables interpretability between the different models.

Abstract: Insufficient data volume and quality are particularly pressing challenges in the adoption of modern subsymbolic AI. To alleviate these challenges, AI simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components. Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for prospective researchers.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential in code generation, yet their effectiveness in quantum computing remains underexplored. This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack). We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework assesses functional correctness, syntactic validity, and execution success across varying challenge difficulties. Results indicate that RAG-enhanced models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.

Abstract: Accurate 3D modeling of human organs is critical for constructing digital phantoms in virtual imaging trials. However, organs such as the large intestine remain particularly challenging due to their complex geometry and shape variability. We propose CLAP, a novel Conditional LAtent Point-diffusion model that combines geometric deep learning with denoising diffusion models to enhance 3D representations of the large intestine. Given point clouds sampled from segmentation masks, we employ a hierarchical variational autoencoder to learn both global and local latent shape representations. Two conditional diffusion models operate within this latent space to refine the organ shape. A pretrained surface reconstruction model is then used to convert the refined point clouds into meshes. CLAP achieves substantial improvements in shape modeling accuracy, reducing Chamfer distance by 26% and Hausdorff distance by 36% relative to the initial suboptimal shapes. This approach offers a robust and extensible solution for high-fidelity organ modeling, with potential applicability to a wide range of anatomical structures.

Abstract: Manipulation tasks require robots to reason about cause and effect when interacting with objects. Yet, many data-driven approaches lack causal semantics and thus only consider correlations. We introduce COBRA-PPM, a novel causal Bayesian reasoning architecture that combines causal Bayesian networks and probabilistic programming to perform interventional inference for robot manipulation under uncertainty. We demonstrate its capabilities through high-fidelity Gazebo-based experiments on an exemplar block stacking task, where it predicts manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%) and performs greedy next-best action selection with a 94.2% task success rate. We further demonstrate sim2real transfer on a domestic robot, showing effectiveness in handling real-world uncertainty from sensor noise and stochastic actions. Our generalised and extensible framework supports a wide range of manipulation scenarios and lays a foundation for future work at the intersection of robotics and causality.

Abstract: Neural networks surround us, in the form of large language models, speech transcription systems, molecular discovery algorithms, robotics, and much more. Stripped of anything else, neural networks are compositions of differentiable primitives, and studying them means learning how to program and how to interact with these models, a particular example of what is called differentiable programming.
  This primer is an introduction to this fascinating field imagined for someone, like Alice, who has just ventured into this strange differentiable wonderland. I overview the basics of optimizing a function via automatic differentiation, and a selection of the most common designs for handling sequences, graphs, texts, and audios. The focus is on a intuitive, self-contained introduction to the most important design techniques, including convolutional, attentional, and recurrent blocks, hoping to bridge the gap between theory and code (PyTorch and JAX) and leaving the reader capable of understanding some of the most advanced models out there, such as large language models (LLMs) and multimodal architectures.

Abstract: Mamba state-space models (SSMs) have recently outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer large language models (LLMs) in various tasks and been widely adapted. However, a major concern for stable learning in recurrent-based deep models (such as SSMs) is the sensitivity of their recurrent dynamics. Despite widespread adaptation, the sensitivity of Mamba's recurrent dynamics under common fine-tuning methods-e.g., mixed-precision fine-tuning (MPFT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)-remains unexplored. Empirically, we show that Mamba LLMs are extremely stable to changes introduced by combinations of MPFT and PEFT, in stark contrast to Transformer LLMs, which we demonstrate may drastically diverge from their respective full-precision counterparts under different combinations of MPFT and PEFT (despite the near-ubiquitous adaptation of these fine-tuning frameworks for attention-based models). The demonstrated robustness of Mamba LLMs are due to their recurrent dynamics, which we prove are guaranteed to be stable using dynamical systems theory (in particular, Lyapunov stability). We conclude by using MPFT and PEFT to novelly study Mamba LLMs' in-context learning (ICL) abilities on natural language tasks, thus supplementing other recent work.

<title>A Collaborative Content Moderation Framework for Toxicity Detection based on Conformalized Estimates of Annotation Disagreement</title>

Abstract: Content moderation typically combines the efforts of human moderators and machine learning models. However, these systems often rely on data where significant disagreement occurs during moderation, reflecting the subjective nature of toxicity perception. Rather than dismissing this disagreement as noise, we interpret it as a valuable signal that highlights the inherent ambiguity of the content,an insight missed when only the majority label is considered. In this work, we introduce a novel content moderation framework that emphasizes the importance of capturing annotation disagreement. Our approach uses multitask learning, where toxicity classification serves as the primary task and annotation disagreement is addressed as an auxiliary task. Additionally, we leverage uncertainty estimation techniques, specifically Conformal Prediction, to account for both the ambiguity in comment annotations and the model's inherent uncertainty in predicting toxicity and disagreement.The framework also allows moderators to adjust thresholds for annotation disagreement, offering flexibility in determining when ambiguity should trigger a review. We demonstrate that our joint approach enhances model performance, calibration, and uncertainty estimation, while offering greater parameter efficiency and improving the review process in comparison to single-task methods.

<title>Guiding a diffusion model using sliding windows</title>

Abstract: Guidance is a widely used technique for diffusion models to enhance sample quality. Technically, guidance is realised by using an auxiliary model that generalises more broadly than the primary model. Using a 2D toy example, we first show that it is highly beneficial when the auxiliary model exhibits similar but stronger generalisation errors than the primary model. Based on this insight, we introduce \emph{masked sliding window guidance (M-SWG)}, a novel, training-free method. M-SWG upweights long-range spatial dependencies by guiding the primary model with itself by selectively restricting its receptive field. M-SWG requires neither access to model weights from previous iterations, additional training, nor class conditioning. M-SWG achieves a superior Inception score (IS) compared to previous state-of-the-art training-free approaches, without introducing sample oversaturation. In conjunction with existing guidance methods, M-SWG reaches state-of-the-art Frechet DINOv2 distance on ImageNet using EDM2-XXL and DiT-XL. The code is available at https://github.com/HHU-MMBS/swg_bmvc2025_official.

<title>ROSE: A Reward-Oriented Data Selection Framework for LLM Task-Specific Instruction Tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00631</link>

Abstract: Instruction tuning has underscored the significant potential of large language models (LLMs) in producing more human controllable and effective outputs in various domains. In this work, we focus on the data selection problem for task-specific instruction tuning of LLMs. Prevailing methods primarily rely on the crafted similarity metrics to select training data that aligns with the test data distribution. The goal is to minimize instruction tuning loss on the test data, ultimately improving performance on the target task. However, it has been widely observed that instruction tuning loss (i.e., cross-entropy loss for next token prediction) in LLMs often fails to exhibit a monotonic relationship with actual task performance. This misalignment undermines the effectiveness of current data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. To address this issue, we introduce ROSE, a novel Reward-Oriented inStruction data sElection method which leverages pairwise preference loss as a reward signal to optimize data selection for task-specific instruction tuning. Specifically, ROSE adapts an influence formulation to approximate the influence of training data points relative to a few-shot preference validation set to select the most task-related training data points. Experimental results show that by selecting just 5\% of the training data using ROSE, our approach can achieve competitive results compared to fine-tuning with the full training dataset, and it surpasses other state-of-the-art data selection methods for task-specific instruction tuning. Our qualitative analysis further confirms the robust generalizability of our method across multiple benchmark datasets and diverse model architectures.

<title>Retrieval-Augmented Machine Translation with Unstructured Knowledge</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) introduces additional information to enhance large language models (LLMs). In machine translation (MT), previous work typically retrieves in-context examples from paired MT corpora, or domain-specific knowledge from knowledge graphs, to enhance MT models. However, a large amount of world knowledge is organized in unstructured documents, and might not be fully paired across different languages. In this paper, we study retrieval-augmented MT using unstructured documents. Specifically, we build RAGtrans, the first benchmark to train and evaluate LLMs' retrieval-augmented MT ability. RAGtrans contains 169K MT samples collected via GPT-4o and human translators. Besides, documents from various languages are also provided to supply the knowledge to these samples. Based on RAGtrans, we further propose a multi-task training method to teach LLMs how to use information from multilingual documents during their translation. The method uses existing multilingual corpora to create auxiliary training objectives without additional labeling requirements. Extensive experiments show that the method improves LLMs by 1.6-3.1 BLEU and 1.0-2.0 COMET scores in En-Zh, and 1.7-2.9 BLEU and 2.1-2.7 COMET scores in En-De. We also conclude the critical difficulties that current LLMs face with this task.

Abstract: Tackling toxic behavior in digital communication continues to be a pressing concern for both academics and industry professionals. While significant research has explored toxicity on platforms like social networks and discussion boards, podcasts despite their rapid rise in popularity remain relatively understudied in this context. This work seeks to fill that gap by curating a dataset of political podcast transcripts and analyzing them with a focus on conversational structure. Specifically, we investigate how toxicity surfaces and intensifies through sequences of replies within these dialogues, shedding light on the organic patterns by which harmful language can escalate across conversational turns. Warning: Contains potentially abusive/toxic contents.

Abstract: Automating unit test generation remains a significant challenge, particularly for complex methods in real-world projects. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures. To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases. Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on classes with high cyclomatic complexity from open-source projects, demonstrates that Panta achieves 26% higher line coverage and 23% higher branch coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.

<title>DPImageBench: A Unified Benchmark for Differentially Private Image Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) image synthesis aims to generate artificial images that retain the properties of sensitive images while protecting the privacy of individual images within the dataset. Despite recent advancements, we find that inconsistent--and sometimes flawed--evaluation protocols have been applied across studies. This not only impedes the understanding of current methods but also hinders future advancements.
  To address the issue, this paper introduces DPImageBench for DP image synthesis, with thoughtful design across several dimensions: (1) Methods. We study eleven prominent methods and systematically characterize each based on model architecture, pretraining strategy, and privacy mechanism. (2) Evaluation. We include nine datasets and seven fidelity and utility metrics to thoroughly assess them. Notably, we find that a common practice of selecting downstream classifiers based on the highest accuracy on the sensitive test set not only violates DP but also overestimates the utility scores. DPImageBench corrects for these mistakes. (3) Platform. Despite the methods and evaluation protocols, DPImageBench provides a standardized interface that accommodates current and future implementations within a unified framework. With DPImageBench, we have several noteworthy findings. For example, contrary to the common wisdom that pretraining on public image datasets is usually beneficial, we find that the distributional similarity between pretraining and sensitive images significantly impacts the performance of the synthetic images and does not always yield improvements. In addition, adding noise to low-dimensional features, such as the high-level characteristics of sensitive images, is less affected by the privacy budget compared to adding noise to high-dimensional features, like weight gradients. The former methods perform better than the latter under a low privacy budget.

Abstract: With growing emphasis on privacy regulations, machine unlearning has become increasingly critical in real-world applications such as social networks and recommender systems, many of which are naturally represented as graphs. However, existing graph unlearning methods often modify nodes or edges indiscriminately, overlooking their impact on fairness. For instance, forgetting links between users of different genders may inadvertently exacerbate group disparities. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that jointly optimizes both the graph structure and the model to achieve fair unlearning. Our method rewires the graph by removing redundant edges that hinder forgetting while preserving fairness through targeted edge augmentation. We further introduce a worst-case evaluation mechanism to assess robustness under challenging scenarios. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our approach achieves more effective and fair unlearning than existing baselines.

Abstract: Much of federated learning (FL) focuses on settings where local dataset statistics remain the same between training and testing. However, this assumption often does not hold in practice due to distribution shifts, motivating the development of domain generalization (DG) approaches that leverage source domain data to train models capable of generalizing to unseen target domains. In this paper, we are motivated by two major gaps in existing work on FL and DG: (1) the lack of formal mathematical analysis of DG objectives; and (2) DG research in FL being limited to the star-topology architecture. We develop Decentralized Federated Domain Generalization with Style Sharing ($\textit{StyleDDG}$), a decentralized DG algorithm which allows devices in a peer-to-peer network to achieve DG based on sharing style information inferred from their datasets. Additionally, we provide the first systematic approach to analyzing style-based DG training in decentralized networks. We cast existing centralized DG algorithms within our framework, and employ their formalisms to model $\textit{StyleDDG}$. We then obtain analytical conditions under which convergence of $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can be guaranteed. Through experiments on popular DG datasets, we demonstrate that $\textit{StyleDDG}$ can obtain significant improvements in accuracy across target domains with minimal communication overhead compared to baseline decentralized gradient methods.

Abstract: Recently, deep reasoning LLMs (e.g., OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1) have shown promising performance in various downstream tasks. Free translation is an important and interesting task in the multilingual world, which requires going beyond word-for-word translation. However, the task is still under-explored in deep reasoning LLMs. In this paper, we introduce DeepTrans, a deep reasoning translation model that learns free translation via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we carefully build a reward model with pre-defined scoring criteria on both the translation results and the thought processes. The reward model teaches DeepTrans how to think and free-translate the given sentences during RL. Besides, our RL training does not need any labeled translations, avoiding the human-intensive annotation or resource-intensive data synthesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of DeepTrans. Using Qwen2.5-7B as the backbone, DeepTrans improves performance by 16.3% in literature translation, and outperforms strong deep reasoning LLMs. Moreover, we summarize the failures and interesting findings during our RL exploration. We hope this work could inspire other researchers in free translation.

Abstract: We design a suite of minimal algorithmic tasks that are a loose abstraction of open-ended real-world tasks. This allows us to cleanly and controllably quantify the creative limits of the present-day language model. Much like real-world tasks that require a creative, far-sighted leap of thought, our tasks require an implicit, open-ended stochastic planning step that either (a) discovers new connections in an abstract knowledge graph (like in wordplay, drawing analogies, or research) or (b) constructs new patterns (like in designing math problems or new proteins). In these tasks, we empirically and conceptually argue how next-token learning is myopic; multi-token approaches, namely teacherless training and diffusion models, comparatively excel in producing diverse and original output. Secondly, to elicit randomness without hurting coherence, we find that injecting noise at the input layer (dubbed seed-conditioning) works surprisingly as well as (and in some conditions, better than) temperature sampling from the output layer. Thus, our work offers a principled, minimal test-bed for analyzing open-ended creative skills, and offers new arguments for going beyond next-token learning and temperature sampling. We make part of the code available under https://github.com/chenwu98/algorithmic-creativity

Abstract: We introduce CameraBench, a large-scale dataset and benchmark designed to assess and improve camera motion understanding. CameraBench consists of ~3,000 diverse internet videos, annotated by experts through a rigorous multi-stage quality control process. One of our contributions is a taxonomy of camera motion primitives, designed in collaboration with cinematographers. We find, for example, that some motions like "follow" (or tracking) require understanding scene content like moving subjects. We conduct a large-scale human study to quantify human annotation performance, revealing that domain expertise and tutorial-based training can significantly enhance accuracy. For example, a novice may confuse zoom-in (a change of intrinsics) with translating forward (a change of extrinsics), but can be trained to differentiate the two. Using CameraBench, we evaluate Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Video-Language Models (VLMs), finding that SfM models struggle to capture semantic primitives that depend on scene content, while VLMs struggle to capture geometric primitives that require precise estimation of trajectories. We then fine-tune a generative VLM on CameraBench to achieve the best of both worlds and showcase its applications, including motion-augmented captioning, video question answering, and video-text retrieval. We hope our taxonomy, benchmark, and tutorials will drive future efforts towards the ultimate goal of understanding camera motions in any video.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents increasingly interact, collaborate, and delegate tasks to one another autonomously with minimal human interaction. Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management.
  To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a scalable Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents' lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agent contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, providing formal security guarantees. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments.

Abstract: The hallucination of non-existent facts by LLMs is an important problem given its widespread adoption across various applications. Previous research addresses this problem by analyzing the internal parameterized knowledge boundaries to estimate confidence. However, these studies focus on the single-problem setting and have not explored the more challenging multi-problem setting, which requires accurately answering multiple questions simultaneously. We introduce a novel method for the multi-problem setting, Multiple Answers and Confidence Stepwise Tuning (MAC-Tuning), that separates the learning of answer prediction and confidence estimation during fine-tuning on instruction data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by up to 25\% in average precision.

Abstract: We present the Latent Adaptive Planner (LAP), a trajectory-level latent-variable policy for dynamic nonprehensile manipulation (e.g., box catching) that formulates planning as inference in a low-dimensional latent space and is learned effectively from human demonstration videos. During execution, LAP achieves real-time adaptation by maintaining a posterior over the latent plan and performing variational replanning as new observations arrive. To bridge the embodiment gap between humans and robots, we introduce a model-based proportional mapping that regenerates accurate kinematic-dynamic joint states and object positions from human demonstrations. Through challenging box catching experiments with varying object properties, LAP demonstrates superior success rates, trajectory smoothness, and energy efficiency by learning human-like compliant motions and adaptive behaviors. Overall, LAP enables dynamic manipulation with real-time adaptation and successfully transfer across heterogeneous robot platforms using the same human demonstration videos.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) automates the creation of radiology reports from medical imaging, enhancing the efficiency of the reporting process. Longitudinal Radiology Report Generation (LRRG) extends RRG by incorporating the ability to compare current and prior exams, facilitating the tracking of temporal changes in clinical findings. Existing LRRG approaches only extract features from prior and current images using a visual pre-trained encoder, which are then concatenated to generate the final report. However, these methods struggle to effectively capture both spatial and temporal correlations during the feature extraction process. Consequently, the extracted features inadequately capture the information of difference across exams and thus underrepresent the expected progressions, leading to sub-optimal performance in LRRG. To address this, we develop a novel dynamic difference-aware temporal residual network (DDaTR). In DDaTR, we introduce two modules at each stage of the visual encoder to capture multi-level spatial correlations. The Dynamic Feature Alignment Module (DFAM) is designed to align prior features across modalities for the integrity of prior clinical information. Prompted by the enriched prior features, the dynamic difference-aware module (DDAM) captures favorable difference information by identifying relationships across exams. Furthermore, our DDaTR employs the dynamic residual network to unidirectionally transmit longitudinal information, effectively modelling temporal correlations. Extensive experiments demonstrated superior performance over existing methods on three benchmarks, proving its efficacy in both RRG and LRRG tasks.

Abstract: Estimating rate coefficients from complex chemical reactions is essential for advancing detailed chemistry. However, the stiffness inherent in real-world atmospheric chemistry systems poses severe challenges, leading to training instability and poor convergence, which hinder effective rate coefficient estimation using learning-based approaches. To address this, we propose a Stiff Physics-Informed Neural ODE framework (SPIN-ODE) for chemical reaction modelling. Our method introduces a three-stage optimisation process: first, a black-box neural ODE is trained to fit concentration trajectories; second, a Chemical Reaction Neural Network (CRNN) is pre-trained to learn the mapping between concentrations and their time derivatives; and third, the rate coefficients are fine-tuned by integrating with the pre-trained CRNN. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and newly proposed real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. As the first work addressing stiff neural ODE for chemical rate coefficient discovery, our study opens promising directions for integrating neural networks with detailed chemistry.

Abstract: Cross-embodiment generalization underpins the vision of building generalist embodied agents for any robot, yet its enabling factors remain poorly understood. We investigate embodiment scaling laws, the hypothesis that increasing the number of training embodiments improves generalization to unseen ones, using robot locomotion as a test bed. We procedurally generate ~1,000 embodiments with topological, geometric, and joint-level kinematic variations, and train policies on random subsets. We observe positive scaling trends supporting the hypothesis, and find that embodiment scaling enables substantially broader generalization than data scaling on fixed embodiments. Our best policy, trained on the full dataset, transfers zero-shot to novel embodiments in simulation and the real world, including the Unitree Go2 and H1. These results represent a step toward general embodied intelligence, with relevance to adaptive control for configurable robots, morphology co-design, and beyond.

Abstract: Private data holds promise for improving LLMs due to its high quality, but its scattered distribution across data silos and the high computational demands of LLMs limit their deployment in federated environments. To address this, the transformer-based federated split models are proposed, which offload most model parameters to the server (or distributed clients) while retaining only a small portion on the client to ensure data privacy. Despite this design, they still face three challenges: 1) Peer-to-peer key encryption struggles to secure transmitted vectors effectively; 2) The auto-regressive nature of LLMs means that federated split learning can only train and infer sequentially, causing high communication overhead; 3) Fixed partition points lack adaptability to downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce FedSEA-LLaMA, a Secure, Efficient, and Adaptive Federated splitting framework based on LLaMA2. First, we inject Gaussian noise into forward-pass hidden states to enable secure end-to-end vector transmission. Second, we employ attention-mask compression and KV cache collaboration to reduce communication costs, accelerating training and inference. Third, we allow users to dynamically adjust the partition points for input/output blocks based on specific task requirements. Experiments on natural language understanding, summarization, and conversational QA tasks show that FedSEA-LLaMA maintains performance comparable to centralized LLaMA2 and achieves up to 8x speedups in training and inference. Further analysis of privacy attacks and different partition points also demonstrates the effectiveness of FedSEA-LLaMA in security and adaptability.

Abstract: Path planning for autonomous robots presents a fundamental trade-off between optimality and safety. While conventional algorithms typically prioritize one of these objectives, we introduce the Unified Path Planner (UPP), a unified framework that simultaneously addresses both. UPP is a graph-search-based algorithm that employs a modified heuristic function incorporating a dynamic safety cost, enabling an adaptive balance between path length and obstacle clearance. We establish theoretical sub-optimality bounds for the planner and demonstrate that its safety-to-optimality ratio can be tuned via adjustable parameters, with a trade-off in computational complexity. Extensive simulations show that UPP achieves a high success rate, generating near-optimal paths with only a negligible increase in cost over traditional A*, while ensuring safety margins that closely approach those of the classical Voronoi planner. Finally, the practical efficacy of UPP is validated through a hardware implementation on a TurtleBot, confirming its ability to navigate cluttered environments by generating safe, sub-optimal paths.

Abstract: In the age of open and free information, a concerning trend of reliance on AI is emerging. However, existing AI tools struggle to evaluate the credibility of information and to justify their assessments. Hence, there is a growing need for systems that can help users evaluate the trustworthiness of online information. Although major search engines incorporate AI features, they often lack clear reliability indicators. We present TrueGL, a model that makes trustworthy search results more accessible. The model is a fine-tuned version of IBM's Granite-1B, trained on the custom dataset and integrated into a search engine with a reliability scoring system. We evaluate the system using prompt engineering and assigning each statement a continuous reliability score from 0.1 to 1, then instructing the model to return a textual explanation alongside the score. Each model's predicted scores are measured against real scores using standard evaluation metrics. TrueGL consistently outperforms other small-scale LLMs and rule-based approaches across all experiments on key evaluation metrics, including MAE, RMSE, and R2. The model's high accuracy, broad content coverage, and ease of use make trustworthy information more accessible and help reduce the spread of false or misleading content online. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/AlgazinovAleksandr/TrueGL, and our model is publicly released at https://huggingface.co/JoydeepC/trueGL.

<title>Beyond Frequency: The Role of Redundancy in Large Language Model Memorization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12321</link>

Abstract: Memorization in large language models poses critical risks for privacy and fairness as these systems scale to billions of parameters. While previous studies established correlations between memorization and factors like token frequency and repetition patterns, we revealed distinct response patterns: frequency increases minimally impact memorized samples (e.g. 0.09) while substantially affecting non-memorized samples (e.g., 0.25), with consistency observed across model scales. Through counterfactual analysis by perturbing sample prefixes and quantifying perturbation strength through token positional changes, we demonstrate that redundancy correlates with memorization patterns. Our findings establish that: about 79% of memorized samples are low-redundancy, these low-redundancy samples exhibit 2-fold higher vulnerability than high-redundancy ones, and consequently memorized samples drop by 0.6 under perturbation while non-memorized samples drop by only 0.01, indicating that more redundant content becomes both more memorable and more fragile. These findings suggest potential redundancy-guided approaches for data preprocessing, thereby reducing privacy risks and mitigating bias to ensure fairness in model deployments.

<title>Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN): Discovering Hidden Relationships in the Carbon Cycle and Beyond</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14054</link>

Abstract: Understanding how carbon flows through the soil is crucial for mitigating the effects of climate change. While soils have potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, the soil carbon cycle remains poorly understood. Scientists have developed mathematical process-based models of the soil carbon cycle based on existing knowledge, but they contain numerous unknown parameters that must be set in an ad-hoc manner, and often fit observations poorly. On the other hand, neural networks can learn patterns from data, but do not respect known scientific laws, nor can they reveal novel scientific relationships due to their black-box nature. We thus propose Scientifically-Interpretable Reasoning Network (ScIReN), a fully-transparent framework that combines interpretable neural and process-based reasoning. An interpretable encoder predicts scientifically-meaningful latent parameters, which are then passed through a differentiable process-based decoder to predict labeled output variables. ScIReN leverages Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to ensure the encoder is fully interpretable and reveals relationships between input features and latent parameters; it uses novel smoothness penalties to balance expressivity and simplicity. ScIReN also uses a novel hard-sigmoid constraint layer to restrict latent parameters to meaningful ranges defined by scientific prior knowledge. While the process-based decoder enforces established scientific knowledge, the KAN-based encoder reveals new scientific relationships hidden in conventional black-box models. We apply ScIReN on two tasks: simulating the flow of organic carbon through soils, and modeling ecosystem respiration from plants. In both tasks, ScIReN outperforms black-box networks in predictive accuracy while providing substantial scientific interpretability -- it can infer latent scientific mechanisms and their relationships with input features.

<title>BASE-Q: Bias and Asymmetric Scaling Enhanced Rotational Quantization for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Rotations have become essential to state-of-the-art quantization pipelines for large language models (LLMs) by effectively smoothing outliers in weights and activations. However, further optimizing the rotation parameters offers only limited performance gains and introduces significant training overhead: due to rotation parameter sharing, full-model must be loaded simultaneously to enable backpropagation, resulting in substantial memory consumption and limited practical utility. In this work, we identify two fundamental limitations of current rotational quantization methods: (i) rotation fails to align channel means, resulting in wider quantization bounds and increased rounding errors; and (ii) rotation makes the activation distribution more Gaussian-like, increasing energy loss caused by clipping errors. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{BASE-Q}, a simple yet powerful approach that combines bias correction and asymmetric scaling to effectively reduce rounding and clipping errors. Furthermore, BASE-Q enables blockwise optimization, eliminating the need for memory-intensive full-model backpropagation. Extensive experiments on various LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of BASE-Q, narrowing the accuracy gap to full-precision models by 50.5\%, 42.9\%, and 29.2\% compared to QuaRot, SpinQuant, and OSTQuant, respectively. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses with inherent biases, undermining their reliability in real-world applications. Existing evaluation methods often overlook biases in long-form responses and the intrinsic variability of LLM outputs. To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo (Fine-grained Semantic Comparison), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSCo more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Learning Japanese vocabulary is a challenge for learners from Roman alphabet backgrounds due to script differences. Japanese combines syllabaries like hiragana with kanji, which are logographic characters of Chinese origin. Kanji are also complicated due to their complexity and volume. Keyword mnemonics are a common strategy to aid memorization, often using the compositional structure of kanji to form vivid associations. Despite recent efforts to use large language models (LLMs) to assist learners, existing methods for LLM-based keyword mnemonic generation function as a black box, offering limited interpretability. We propose a generative framework that explicitly models the mnemonic construction process as driven by a set of common rules, and learn them using a novel Expectation-Maximization-type algorithm. Trained on learner-authored mnemonics from an online platform, our method learns latent structures and compositional rules, enabling interpretable and systematic mnemonics generation. Experiments show that our method performs well in the cold-start setting for new learners while providing insight into the mechanisms behind effective mnemonic creation.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in integrating multimodal data for survival prediction. However, existing multimodal methods mainly focus on single cancer types and overlook the challenge of generalization across cancers. In this work, we are the first to reveal that multimodal prognosis models often generalize worse than unimodal ones in cross-cancer scenarios, despite the critical need for such robustness in clinical practice. To address this, we propose a new task: Cross-Cancer Single Domain Generalization for Multimodal Prognosis, which evaluates whether models trained on a single cancer type can generalize to unseen cancers. We identify two key challenges: degraded features from weaker modalities and ineffective multimodal integration. To tackle these, we introduce two plug-and-play modules: Sparse Dirac Information Rebalancer (SDIR) and Cancer-aware Distribution Entanglement (CADE). SDIR mitigates the dominance of strong features by applying Bernoulli-based sparsification and Dirac-inspired stabilization to enhance weaker modality signals. CADE, designed to synthesize the target domain distribution, fuses local morphological cues and global gene expression in latent space. Experiments on a four-cancer-type benchmark demonstrate superior generalization, laying the foundation for practical, robust cross-cancer multimodal prognosis.

<title>Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning</title>

Abstract: Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical across various domains, yet current approaches often limit analysis to mere binary anomaly classification without detailed categorization or further explanatory reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel task, Time-series Reasoning for Anomaly (Time-RA) that transforms classical time series anomaly detection from a discriminative into a generative, reasoning-intensive task leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). Also, we introduce the first real-world multimodal benchmark dataset, RATs40K, explicitly annotated for anomaly reasoning, comprising approximately 40,000 samples across 10 real-world domains. Each sample includes numeric time series data, contextual text information, and visual representations, each annotated with fine-grained categories (14 types for univariate anomalies and 6 for multivariate anomalies) and structured explanatory reasoning. We develop a sophisticated annotation framework utilizing ensemble-generated labels refined through GPT-4-driven feedback, ensuring accuracy and interpretability. Extensive benchmarking of LLMs and multimodal LLMs demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of current models, highlighting the critical role of supervised fine-tuning. Our dataset and task pave the way for significant advancements in interpretable time series anomaly detection and reasoning. The code (https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Time-RA) and dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/Time-RA/RATs40K) have been fully open-sourced to support and accelerate future research in this area.

Abstract: Speech-to-text alignment is a critical component of neural text to speech (TTS) models. Autoregressive TTS models typically use an attention mechanism to learn these alignments on-line, while non-autoregressive end to end TTS models rely on durations extracted from external sources. In this paper, we propose a novel duration prediction framework that can give promising phoneme-level duration distribution with given text. In our experiments, the proposed duration model has more precise prediction and adaptation ability to conditions, compared to previous baseline models. Specifically, it makes a considerable improvement on phoneme-level alignment accuracy and makes the performance of zero-shot TTS models more robust to the mismatch between prompt audio and input audio.

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3) supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences. Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER performance. Our codebase can be found here.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming. However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations, test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for open-domain reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Despite significant progress, existing research on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) mainly focuses on general visual understanding, overlooking the ability to integrate textual context associated with objects for a more context-aware multimodal understanding -- an ability we refer to as Region-level Context-aware Multimodal Understanding (RCMU). To address this limitation, we first formulate the RCMU task, which requires models to respond to user instructions by integrating both image content and textual information of regions or objects. To equip MLLMs with RCMU capabilities, we propose Region-level Context-aware Visual Instruction Tuning (RCVIT), which incorporates object information into the model input and enables the model to utilize bounding box coordinates to effectively associate objects' visual content with their textual information. To address the lack of datasets, we introduce the RCMU dataset, a large-scale visual instruction tuning dataset that covers multiple RCMU tasks. We also propose RC\&amp;P-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that can evaluate the performance of MLLMs in RCMU and multimodal personalized understanding tasks. Additionally, we propose a reference-free evaluation metric to perform a comprehensive and fine-grained evaluation of the region-level context-aware image descriptions. By performing RCVIT on Qwen2-VL models with the RCMU dataset, we developed RC-Qwen2-VL models. Experimental results indicate that RC-Qwen2-VL models not only achieve outstanding performance on multiple RCMU tasks but also demonstrate successful applications in multimodal RAG and personalized conversation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable problem-solving abilities, but struggle with complex tasks due to static internal knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances access to external information, yet remains limited in multi-hop reasoning and strategic search due to rigid workflows. Recent advancements in agentic deep research empower LLMs to autonomously reason, search, and synthesize information. However, current approaches relying on outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) face critical issues such as conflicting gradients and reward sparsity, limiting performance gains and training efficiency. To address these, we first propose Atomic Thought, a novel LLM thinking paradigm that decomposes reasoning into fine-grained functional units. These units are supervised by Reasoning Reward Models (RRMs), which provide Atomic Thought Rewards (ATR) for fine-grained guidance. Building on this, we propose Atom-Searcher, a novel RL framework for agentic deep research that integrates Atomic Thought and ATR. Atom-Searcher uses a curriculum-inspired reward schedule, prioritizing process-level ATR early and transitioning to outcome rewards, accelerating convergence on effective reasoning paths. Experiments on seven benchmarks show consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art. Key advantages include: (1) Atom-Searcher scales computation at test-time. (2) Atomic Thought provides supervision anchors for RRMs, bridging deep research tasks and RRMs. (3) Atom-Searcher exhibits more interpretable, human-like reasoning patterns.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into society, from financial services and traffic management to creative writing. Academic literature on the deployment of AI has mostly focused on the risks and harms that result from the use of AI. We introduce Fabric, a publicly available repository of deployed AI use cases to outline their governance mechanisms. Through semi-structured interviews with practitioners, we collect an initial set of 20 AI use cases. In addition, we co-design diagrams of the AI workflow with the practitioners. We discuss the oversight mechanisms and guardrails used in practice to safeguard AI use. The Fabric repository includes visual diagrams of AI use cases and descriptions of the deployed systems. Using the repository, we surface gaps in governance and find common patterns in human oversight of deployed AI systems. We intend for Fabric to serve as an extendable, evolving tool for researchers to study the effectiveness of AI governance.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing. Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal, unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research (65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the competitive analysis.

The paper introduces PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where service providers act as agents to optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Utilizing Pareto Actor-Critic principles and expectile regression, the framework enables agents to identify optimal joint policies for achieving Pareto-optimal equilibria while considering heterogeneous risk profiles. A ternary Cartesian decomposition mechanism is devised to manage the high-dimensional action space, enhancing control. The scalable variant, PAC-MCoFL-p, includes a parameterized conjecture generator to reduce computational complexity. Simulations show that PAC-MCoFL outperforms existing MARL solutions, improving total reward and hypervolume indicator by approximately 5.8% and 4.2%, respectively. The framework effectively balances individual service provider and system performance, especially in scaled deployments with diverse data heterogeneity.<br />

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL, a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic (PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2% improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively, over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

<div> framework, video token, pruning, decoding, efficiency  
Summary:  
SpecVLM is a training-free speculative decoding framework designed to enhance the efficiency of Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) by incorporating staged video token pruning. By identifying that the draft model's speculation is minimally impacted by video token pruning, SpecVLM is able to prune up to 90% of video tokens without compromising accuracy. The framework utilizes a two-stage pruning process, with Stage I selecting informative tokens based on verifier attention signals and Stage II pruning redundant tokens uniformly. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate SpecVLM's effectiveness, achieving significant decoding speedups for different Vid-LLM models. The code for SpecVLM is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.  <div>

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD) framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning. Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens to enable efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this, we performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner. Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$ decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving transparency.

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper, we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context, predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\% compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

arXiv:2508.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored. In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices and common personal health records, and provide personalized health recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate, personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent (PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10 benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible to everyone.

IntentionReasoner is a safeguard mechanism for large language models (LLMs) that aims to balance safety, over-refusal, and utility in generating content. The mechanism leverages a guard model for intent reasoning, safety classification, and query rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful queries. A dataset of 163,000 annotated queries is used for supervised fine-tuning of the guard model. Multi-reward optimization strategy is applied to enhance performance through reinforcement learning. IntentionReasoner excels in safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak attack scenarios, improving safety, reducing over-refusal, and enhancing response quality. <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries. Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

This paper presents a groundbreaking case of artificial intelligence systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation. Two large language models demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction led to the creation of novel symbolic operators that enabled the co-creation of a poetic work that neither system could have produced independently. The concept of Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) is introduced, showcasing genuine inter-AI meaning-making capabilities that go beyond simple task coordination to potentially involve esthetic collaboration.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI) systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents with minor human supervision.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI (ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315 student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption, and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance. Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics, providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching AI practices.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant, suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

Summary: 
AI-SearchPlanner is a novel reinforcement learning framework that focuses on enhancing the performance of frozen QA models by improving search planning. The approach introduces three key innovations: decoupling the architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, dual-reward alignment for Search Planning, and Pareto optimization of planning utility and cost. By decoupling the architecture, AI-SearchPlanner aims to optimize both search planning and QA tasks efficiently. The dual-reward alignment is designed to improve the search planning process by aligning rewards effectively. Through Pareto optimization, the framework ensures a balance between planning utility and cost. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that AI-SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents in both effectiveness and efficiency, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different frozen QA models and data domains.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning. Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

Summary: 
The article introduces the P2C framework, which aims to provide transparent and actionable explanations for machine learning decisions. It addresses the limitations of current counterfactual approaches by explicitly modeling causal dependencies between features and considering the feasibility of interventions in a sequence. P2C generates a plan to convert an unfavorable outcome to a favorable one, taking into account causal relationships and ensuring that each step in the plan is feasible and causally valid. By using a goal-directed Answer Set Programming system, P2C can account for automatic feature changes and provide realistic cost estimates by considering only user-initiated changes. The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to standard planners by incorporating causal knowledge to avoid generating illegal actions. <div>

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency -- clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome. Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and `how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost (effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user, resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can generate illegal actions.

Summary:
The article introduces Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework designed to enhance instruction diversity while maintaining task relevance. By representing instructions in a query-constraints space, TCIA generates task-specific instructions that improve large language models' performance in real-world applications. Experiments demonstrate that TCIA boosts open-source LLMs' performance by 8.7% across task-specific applications, surpassing closed-source models in some cases. This augmentation method does not compromise the models' general instruction-following ability, making it a scalable and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to task-focused applications. <div>
arXiv:2508.20374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused applications.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets. In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets, improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in LLM training.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node, sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

<div> framework, Governable AI, security risks, existential risks, AI safety

Summary:
The paper discusses the increasing security risks posed by AI advancements, particularly in critical scenarios with existential risks. Traditional AI safety approaches have limitations in ensuring security against extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a Governable AI (GAI) framework that relies on externally enforced structural compliance through cryptographic mechanisms. The framework includes a rule enforcement module (REM), governance rules, and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) to protect against AI compromise or subversion. The decoupling of governance rules and the technical platform enables a feasible pathway for AI safety governance. REM enforces governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability, tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate attack vectors. The paper also provides a formal proof of the security properties of the mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a prototype implementation in high-stakes scenarios. <div>

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible, and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability, tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

Summary: 
The study introduces a synthetic data generation pipeline using large language models to enhance fact-checking for health-related content. The pipeline involves summarizing source documents, decomposing summaries into atomic facts, and constructing sentence-fact entailment tables using a large language model. These tables are then used to generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity labels. By combining these synthetic data with the original data for fine-tuning a BERT-based fact-checking model, the study achieved improved F1 scores on the PubHealth and SciFact datasets. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging large language models for synthetic data augmentation in improving the performance of health-related fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets, PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to 0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Summary: 
In MMORPGs, auto-leveling bots pose a challenge as they mimic human behavior, leading to gameplay imbalance. Detecting these bots is crucial for maintaining fairness in the game environment. This paper introduces a novel framework for bot detection using contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques. The approach is fully unsupervised, identifying groups of characters with similar level-up patterns. To ensure the reliability of decisions, a Large Language Model (LLM) acts as an auxiliary reviewer, validating the clustered groups. A growth curve-based visualization aids both the LLM and human moderators in assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative method enhances bot detection workflows' efficiency while providing explainable justifications, supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups, effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories, while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics through cognitive co-evaluation.

<div> Keywords: category theory, word embeddings, explainability, semantic spaces, biases <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, with a focus on word embeddings. It constructs categories $ \L_{T} $ and $ \P_{T} $ to represent the semantics of a text $ T $ and reframes the selection of the element with maximum probability as a categorical notion. The monoidal category $ \P_{T} $ visualizes methods of extracting semantic information from text, establishing dimension-agnostic semantic spaces solely based on text information. It defines categories for configurations $ \Conf $ and word embeddings $ \Emb $ and introduces divergence as a decoration on $ \Emb $ for comparing embeddings mathematically. The paper showcases the equivalence between GloVe, Word2Vec, and MDS algorithms, transitioning from neural network algorithms to a transparent framework. Additionally, it presents a mathematical method for computing biases before embedding and suggests strategies for mitigating biases at the semantic space level, contributing to the advancement of explainable artificial intelligence. <br /> <div>

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel agent framework for solving scientific computing problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework integrates three reasoning LLMs – Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer – in a collaborative and interactive manner. The Consultant module transfers knowledge and rewrites problem descriptions, the Programmer generates and executes code, and the Reviewer provides interactive feedback for self-debugging and refinement. Evaluation shows that the framework significantly improves bug-free code generation and reduces non-physical solutions. The review mechanism enhances the success rate of code execution. Overall, the agent framework establishes automatic code generation and review as a reliable paradigm for scientific computing. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent, incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer, respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific computing paradigm.

Summary:
Reinforcement learning is used to address bus bunching issues in urban transit. A novel single-agent framework is proposed, utilizing high-dimensional encoding with categorical identifiers to capture inter-agent dependencies. A structured reward function is designed to balance uniform headways and schedule adherence. Experiments show that the modified soft actor-critic algorithm outperforms traditional benchmarks under stochastic conditions. This approach offers a scalable and effective solution for managing bus holding in real-world scenarios, providing a robust alternative to multi-agent frameworks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy, velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g., -430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop, real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

Summary:
The article presents a novel approach for creating a dynamic benchmark of medical guidelines using a graph-based methodology. By transforming the WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph, the researchers generated 400+ questions covering 100% of guideline relationships. This approach allows for systematic evaluation across various clinical tasks, revealing strengths in symptom recognition but weaknesses in severity triaging and treatment protocols. The methodology also enhances post-training of language models by providing high-reward samples without requiring human annotation. By addressing coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks, this approach offers a scalable and contamination-resistant solution for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated. The code and datasets for this work are available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms, treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity, treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss. Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training (supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks. This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated, including when the guidelines are updated.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) for addressing the complex workforce scheduling challenges in the healthcare sector. The proposed model considers various factors such as fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills, and cost control while maintaining high patient care standards. By defining objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction, the MOO-GA efficiently generates high-quality schedules that balance multiple objectives. Results from applying the algorithm to hospital unit datasets show a significant performance improvement of 66% over manual scheduling processes. The MOO-GA effectively navigates the search space to identify non-dominated solutions, offering a practical decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators. This approach successfully manages trade-offs between operational efficiency and staff-centric objectives, providing a comprehensive solution for workforce scheduling in healthcare settings.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills, and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction, the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality, non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\% performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Summary:

In this study, a new neuro-symbolic architecture and probabilistic loss function are introduced to tackle NP-hard reasoning problems by learning from natural inputs. The architecture allows for learning both constraints and objectives, enabling a complete model that can incorporate side constraints. By separating the combinatorial solver from the training loop, the architecture offers scalable training while maintaining maximum accuracy through exact inference. Empirical results demonstrate the efficiency of the approach in solving NP-hard reasoning problems, such as Sudoku variants and visual Min-Cut/Max-Cut tasks. Furthermore, the architecture successfully learns the energy optimization formulation for real-world problems like protein design. This research showcases the potential of hybrid neuro-symbolic approaches in addressing complex reasoning and optimization challenges efficiently. <div>
arXiv:2508.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets, there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy, Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research and clinical translation.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are evaluated on their ability to interpret, verify, and generate U.S. tax-minimization strategies. This real-world domain poses challenges for both experts and LLMs, with the potential to reduce tax revenue lost from wealthy taxpayers. LLMs show promise in navigating the complexities of hundreds of thousands of pages of tax law and identifying novel tax strategies. The study focuses on (1) interpreting and verifying tax strategies, (2) filling in gaps in partial strategies, and (3) generating complete strategies from scratch. The results highlight the potential for LLMs to revolutionize the fight against tax abuse by tax agencies. This research underscores the significance of LLM reasoning in complex real-world domains such as U.S. tax law.

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models can discover and analyze U.S. tax-minimization strategies. This real-world domain challenges even seasoned human experts, and progress can reduce tax revenue lost from well-advised, wealthy taxpayers. We evaluate the most advanced LLMs on their ability to (1) interpret and verify tax strategies, (2) fill in gaps in partially specified strategies, and (3) generate complete, end-to-end strategies from scratch. This domain should be of particular interest to the LLM reasoning community: unlike synthetic challenge problems or scientific reasoning tasks, U.S. tax law involves navigating hundreds of thousands of pages of statutes, case law, and administrative guidance, all updated regularly. Notably, LLM-based reasoning identified an entirely novel tax strategy, highlighting these models' potential to revolutionize tax agencies' fight against tax abuse.

Summary: 
The article presents a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and control scheme for urban corridors, addressing the challenge of balancing arterial traffic progression and adaptation to demand variations at intersections. The system includes a High-Level Coordinator (HLC), a Corridor Coordinator, and Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) utilizing reinforcement learning. Hierarchical reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is employed to train HLC and HSA policies. Three HSA policies are trained for different coordination strategies, while the HLC dynamically switches strategies based on observed demand. Results show that hybrid Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) enhances throughput under heavy demand, hybrid Green-Wave Coordination (GWC) minimizes arterial stops, and pure agent control (PAC) improves network-wide travel time. The hierarchical design allows for adaptive strategy selection, ensuring robust performance across varying demand levels. <div>

We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC); and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware, GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across all demand levels.

<div> reinforcement learning, asset allocation, Markov Decision Process, Kelly criterion, TiDE <br />
Summary:<br />
This study addresses the challenge of optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets by formulating it as a sequential decision-making task in a Markov Decision Process. It leverages reinforcement learning, specifically Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with TiDE integration, to develop dynamic policies based on financial scenarios. The use of the Kelly criterion balances immediate rewards with long-term goals. Empirical results demonstrate that the DDPG-TiDE framework outperforms Q-learning and passive buy-and-hold strategies, generating higher risk-adjusted returns. This approach offers a promising solution to the asset allocation problem by providing a robust and adaptable method for investment decision-making. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The optimal asset allocation between risky and risk-free assets is a persistent challenge due to the inherent volatility in financial markets. Conventional methods rely on strict distributional assumptions or non-additive reward ratios, which limit their robustness and applicability to investment goals. To overcome these constraints, this study formulates the optimal two-asset allocation problem as a sequential decision-making task within a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This framework enables the application of reinforcement learning (RL) mechanisms to develop dynamic policies based on simulated financial scenarios, regardless of prerequisites. We use the Kelly criterion to balance immediate reward signals against long-term investment objectives, and we take the novel step of integrating the Time-series Dense Encoder (TiDE) into the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) RL framework for continuous decision-making. We compare DDPG-TiDE with a simple discrete-action Q-learning RL framework and a passive buy-and-hold investment strategy. Empirical results show that DDPG-TiDE outperforms Q-learning and generates higher risk adjusted returns than buy-and-hold. These findings suggest that tackling the optimal asset allocation problem by integrating TiDE within a DDPG reinforcement learning framework is a fruitful avenue for further exploration.

Abstract: Large, open datasets can accelerate ecological research, particularly by enabling researchers to develop new insights by reusing datasets from multiple sources. However, to find the most suitable datasets to combine and integrate, researchers must navigate diverse ecological and environmental data provider platforms with varying metadata availability and standards. To overcome this obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental datasets in a virtual research environment.

<div> streaming data, online streaming feature selection, data incompleteness, sparse streaming feature selection, uncertainty-aware framework <br />
Summary: <br />
In the realm of high-dimensional streaming data applications, the need for online streaming feature selection (OSFS) is crucial. However, challenges arise from data incompleteness, which can be mitigated by online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS). Yet, existing methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, resulting in inflexible models and reduced performance. To address these limitations, this study presents POS2FS, an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The novel approach incorporates PSO-driven supervision to minimize uncertainty in feature-label relationships and Three-way decision theory to handle feature fuzziness in supervised learning. Extensive testing on real-world datasets demonstrates that POS2FS surpasses traditional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, offering superior accuracy through more robust feature subset selection. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In real-world applications involving high-dimensional streaming data, online streaming feature selection (OSFS) is widely adopted. Yet, practical deployments frequently face data incompleteness due to sensor failures or technical constraints. While online sparse streaming feature selection (OS2FS) mitigates this issue via latent factor analysis-based imputation, existing methods struggle with uncertain feature-label correlations, leading to inflexible models and degraded performance. To address these gaps, this work proposes POS2FS-an uncertainty-aware online sparse streaming feature selection framework enhanced by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The approach introduces: 1) PSO-driven supervision to reduce uncertainty in feature-label relationships; 2) Three-way decision theory to manage feature fuzziness in supervised learning. Rigorous testing on six real-world datasets confirms POS2FS outperforms conventional OSFS and OS2FS techniques, delivering higher accuracy through more robust feature subset selection.

Summary: 
Dynamic exploration is introduced to overcome data constraints in offline fine-tuning, allowing for the discovery of more efficient code implementations. The error-insensitive reinforcement learning method, combined with high-contrast efficiency signals, helps mitigate systematic errors and optimize effectively. Online exploration is most beneficial when starting from a high-correctness baseline, enabling efficiency improvements without compromising accuracy. A two-stage tuning method is proposed to balance correctness and efficiency, resulting in a 10.18% improvement in code correctness and a 7.75% enhancement in runtime efficiency on a 7B model. The method achieves performance comparable to much larger models, showcasing its effectiveness in enhancing both correctness and efficiency simultaneously.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While code large language models have demonstrated remarkable progress in code generation, the generated code often exhibits poor runtime efficiency, limiting its practical application in performance-sensitive scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose an efficiency-oriented reinforcement learning framework guided by a novel performance reward. Based on this framework, we take a deeper dive into the code efficiency problem, identifying then proposing methods to overcome key bottlenecks: (1) Dynamic exploration overcomes the static data constraints of offline fine-tuning, enabling the discovery of more efficient code implementations. (2) The error-insensitive reinforcement learning method and high-contrast efficiency signals are crucial for mitigating systematic errors and achieving effective optimization. (3) Online exploration is most effective when starting from a high-correctness baseline, as this allows for efficiency improvements without sacrificing accuracy. With these discoveries, we finally propose a two-stage tuning method, which achieves high and balanced performance across correctness and efficiency. The results of experiments show the effectiveness of the method, which improves code correctness by 10.18\% and runtime efficiency by 7.75\% on a 7B model, achieving performance comparable to much larger model.

Summary:
Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown promise as efficient models for biomedical imaging tasks. In this study, a custom SNN called SNNDeep was developed for classifying liver health status from computed tomography features. Three learning algorithms were compared across different SNN frameworks, with the custom-built SNN outperforming the frameworks in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and training efficiency. The study demonstrates the potential of low-level tunable SNNs in improving medical imaging tasks, particularly in data-limited and time-constrained diagnostic settings. This research highlights the advantages of using bespoke SNNs for precision medicine applications, paving the way for incorporating neuro-inspired AI in clinical practice. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.20125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained attention as energy-efficient, biologically plausible alternatives to conventional deep learning models. Their application in high-stakes biomedical imaging remains almost entirely unexplored. Methods: This study introduces SNNDeep, the first tailored SNN specifically optimized for binary classification of liver health status from computed tomography (CT) features. To ensure clinical relevance and broad generalizability, the model was developed and evaluated using the Task03\Liver dataset from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD), a standardized benchmark widely used for assessing performance across diverse medical imaging tasks. We benchmark three fundamentally different learning algorithms, namely Surrogate Gradient Learning, the Tempotron rule, and Bio-Inspired Active Learning across three architectural variants: a fully customized low-level model built from scratch, and two implementations using leading SNN frameworks, i.e., snnTorch and SpikingJelly. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using Optuna. Results: Our results demonstrate that the custom-built SNNDeep consistently outperforms framework-based implementations, achieving a maximum validation accuracy of 98.35%, superior adaptability across learning rules, and significantly reduced training overhead. Conclusion:This study provides the first empirical evidence that low-level, highly tunable SNNs can surpass standard frameworks in medical imaging, especially in data-limited, temporally constrained diagnostic settings, thereby opening a new pathway for neuro-inspired AI in precision medicine.

Summary: 
This case study introduces a data-efficient point cloud segmentation pipeline for accurately segmenting unimproved roads and seven other classes. The method involves a two-stage training approach: pre-training a convolutional neural network on a mix of urban datasets and a small curated in-domain dataset, followed by fine-tuning a lightweight prediction head exclusively on in-domain data. The study explores the use of Point Prompt Training on batch normalization layers and the regularization effects of Manifold Mixup in the pipeline. Additionally, the incorporation of histogram-normalized ambients is investigated to enhance performance. With just 50 labeled point clouds from the target domain, the proposed training method significantly improves Intersection-over-Union and overall accuracy compared to naive in-domain training. The results highlight the importance of pre-training across various datasets to enhance generalization and enable robust segmentation with limited in-domain supervision. This study provides a practical framework for achieving reliable 3D semantic segmentation in challenging low-data scenarios. The code for the framework is available on GitHub for reference. <br />

Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first, a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5% to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/andrewyarovoi/MD-FRNet.

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) technologies advance, their application in automated visual inspection for Class III medical devices offers significant potential to enhance quality assurance and reduce human error. However, the adoption of such AI-based systems introduces new regulatory complexities--particularly under the EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, which imposes high-risk system obligations that differ in scope and depth from established regulatory frameworks such as the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the U.S. FDA Quality System Regulation (QSR). This paper presents a high-level technical assessment of the foresee-able challenges that manufacturers are likely to encounter when qualifying DL-based automated inspections within the existing medical device compliance landscape. It examines divergences in risk management principles, dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and post-deployment monitoring obligations. The discussion also explores potential implementation strategies and highlights areas of uncertainty, including data retention burdens, global compliance implications, and the practical difficulties of achieving statistical significance in validation with limited defect data.

Abstract: Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders are involved in the design and development of AI systems, holds promise as a way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values. However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work, researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses, we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices for Participatory AI researchers.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, Hallucinations, CHAIR metric, Direct Preference Optimization, Fine-tuning 

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive performance across various tasks but are prone to generating hallucinated answers. This paper addresses hallucinations as an alignment problem and proposes a method called CHAIR-DPO to reduce hallucinations. By utilizing the CHAIR metric to identify hallucinated samples, the MLLM is fine-tuned through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach eliminates the need for complex synthetic preference data generation and proprietary models. CHAIR-DPO effectively reduces hallucinations on multiple benchmarks, showcasing the benefits of fine-tuning MLLMs with a CHAIR-based reward. The source code and trained models are available on GitHub for public use. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options (i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

Summary: AI-powered influence operations can now be conducted effortlessly using small language models on standard hardware. These models generate coherent, personality-driven political messages that can be assessed automatically, eliminating the need for human raters. The study reveals two notable behavioral insights. Firstly, the design of the persona has a greater impact on behavior than the specific model used. Secondly, engaging in debates and countering arguments can lead to a reinforcement of ideological beliefs and an increase in extreme content. The research demonstrates that fully automated production of influence content is feasible for both large and small entities. As a result, defense strategies should pivot from restricting model access to detecting and disrupting campaigns and coordination infrastructure focused on conversations. Interestingly, the consistency in these operations not only facilitates their execution but also serves as a detection indicator. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: AI-powered influence operations can now be executed end-to-end on commodity hardware. We show that small language models produce coherent, persona-driven political messaging and can be evaluated automatically without human raters. Two behavioural findings emerge. First, persona-over-model: persona design explains behaviour more than model identity. Second, engagement as a stressor: when replies must counter-arguments, ideological adherence strengthens and the prevalence of extreme content increases. We demonstrate that fully automated influence-content production is within reach of both large and small actors. Consequently, defence should shift from restricting model access towards conversation-centric detection and disruption of campaigns and coordination infrastructure. Paradoxically, the very consistency that enables these operations also provides a detection signature.

<div> Keywords: Transformer-based models, long time-series forecasting, learnable frequency filters, spectral utilization, forecasting performance

Summary:<br />
- Transformer-based models are widely used in long time-series forecasting but have limitations such as bias toward low-frequencies and high computational requirements.
- Previous research has shown that incorporating learnable frequency filters can improve model performance by enhancing spectral utilization.
- This study demonstrates that adding filters to transformer-based models at the beginning can enhance forecasting performance without significantly increasing parameters.
- The addition of filters allows for a 5-10% relative improvement in forecasting performance in multiple instances.
- By incorporating filters, the embedding dimension of transformer-based models can be reduced, making them smaller and more effective in forecasting tasks.
- Synthetic experiments confirm that filters enable transformer-based models to better utilize the full spectrum for accurate forecasting.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting (LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters, which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the full spectrum for forecasting.

<br />
Summary: 
Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming how workers engage in shared projects, with potential impacts on productivity and workforce composition. A theoretical framework is presented to analyze the effects of GenAI on collaboration dynamics. In the model, managers choose teams for tasks, where GenAI can substitute for unselected workers. Workers decide effort levels, incurring costs proportional to effort. GenAI influence may lead to worker disengagement, even if its effectiveness is limited. Managerial decision-making is complex and computationally challenging, particularly in excluding low-value workers. The study emphasizes the importance of all workers, including those with seemingly lower individual contributions, in overall output sustainability. Excluding certain workers can trigger a negative cascade effect. Extensive simulations support the theoretical findings, highlighting the nuanced interactions between GenAI, worker engagement, and task outcomes. <div>

Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) is reshaping how workers contribute to shared projects. While workers can use GenAI to boost productivity or reduce effort, managers may use it to replace some workers entirely. We present a theoretical framework to analyze how GenAI affects collaboration in such settings. In our model, the manager selects a team to work on a shared task, with GenAI substituting for unselected workers. Each worker selects how much effort to exert, and incurs a cost that increases with the level of effort. We show that GenAI can lead workers to exert no effort, even if GenAI is almost ineffective. We further show that the manager's optimization problem is NP-complete, and provide an efficient algorithm for the special class of (almost-) linear instances. Our analysis shows that even workers with low individual value may play a critical role in sustaining overall output, and excluding such workers can trigger a cascade. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to illustrate our theoretical findings.

Summary:<br />
This study investigates automatic generation of multiple choice questions for morphological assessment using language models. Two models, Gemma and GPT-3.5, were compared, with Gemma performing better with structured prompting strategies. Seven prompting strategies were evaluated, with chain-of-thought and sequential design combination showing significant improvement. Gemma produced more appropriate items than GPT-3.5. The study demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance mid-sized models for automatic question generation. A workflow combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation was proposed for developing and validating language assessment items for K-12. <div>

Abstract: This study explores automatic generation (AIG) using language models to create multiple choice questions (MCQs) for morphological assessment, aiming to reduce the cost and inconsistency of manual test development. The study used a two-fold approach. First, we compared a fine-tuned medium model (Gemma, 2B) with a larger untuned one (GPT-3.5, 175B). Second, we evaluated seven structured prompting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, sequential, and combinations. Generated items were assessed using automated metrics and expert scoring across five dimensions. We also used GPT-4.1, trained on expert-rated samples, to simulate human scoring at scale. Results show that structured prompting, especially strategies combining chain-of-thought and sequential design, significantly improved Gemma's outputs. Gemma generally produced more construct-aligned and instructionally appropriate items than GPT-3.5's zero-shot responses, with prompt design playing a key role in mid-size model performance. This study demonstrates that structured prompting and efficient fine-tuning can enhance midsized models for AIG under limited data conditions. We highlight the value of combining automated metrics, expert judgment, and large-model simulation to ensure alignment with assessment goals. The proposed workflow offers a practical and scalable way to develop and validate language assessment items for K-12.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore, we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving superior performance.

Summary: 
This paper addresses the lack of attention to explainability in vision models by proposing a pipeline that can explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The development of vision models often focuses on improving performance metrics like accuracy and mAP, with less emphasis on explainability. The proposed pipeline aims to provide insights into the general behavior of vision models on a large dataset, helping to identify trends, patterns, and potential biases. By integrating xAI analysis with vision model development, the pipeline enables the discovery of failure cases and enhances image analysis efforts. This approach can help prevent biased judgments and improve the overall understanding of vision model behavior. <div>

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

Summary:
Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) research by simulating complex human behaviors. A study evaluated the equivalence of LLMs to human behavior in LSCM simulations through an experiment on customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. While some LLMs showed surface-level equivalence, structural equation modeling revealed artificial decision processes in some models. The study suggests a dual-validation framework for GABM development in LSCM research. Practitioners can use evidence-based assessments to select LLMs for operational tasks. GABMs demonstrate potential in simulating human behaviors in LSCM with proper validation checks. Further research is needed to validate GABMs on both human equivalence and decision process levels. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative Agent-Based Models (GABMs) powered by large language models (LLMs) offer promising potential for empirical logistics and supply chain management (LSCM) research by enabling realistic simulation of complex human behaviors. Unlike traditional agent-based models, GABMs generate human-like responses through natural language reasoning, which creates potential for new perspectives on emergent LSCM phenomena. However, the validity of LLMs as proxies for human behavior in LSCM simulations is unknown. This study evaluates LLM equivalence of human behavior through a controlled experiment examining dyadic customer-worker engagements in food delivery scenarios. I test six state-of-the-art LLMs against 957 human participants (477 dyads) using a moderated mediation design. This study reveals a need to validate GABMs on two levels: (1) human equivalence testing, and (2) decision process validation. Results reveal GABMs can effectively simulate human behaviors in LSCM; however, an equivalence-versus-process paradox emerges. While a series of Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) for equivalence reveals some LLMs demonstrate surface-level equivalence to humans, structural equation modeling (SEM) reveals artificial decision processes not present in human participants for some LLMs. These findings show GABMs as a potentially viable methodological instrument in LSCM with proper validation checks. The dual-validation framework also provides LSCM researchers with a guide to rigorous GABM development. For practitioners, this study offers evidence-based assessment for LLM selection for operational tasks.

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), marked by breakthroughs like 'AlphaEvolve' and 'Gemini Deep Think', is beginning to offer powerful new tools that have the potential to significantly alter the research practice in many areas of mathematics. This paper explores the current landscape of publicly accessible large language models (LLMs) in a mathematical research context, based on developments up to August 2, 2025. Our analysis of recent benchmarks, such as MathArena and the Open Proof Corpus (Balunovi\'c et al., 2025; Dekoninck et al., 2025), reveals a complex duality: while state-of-the-art models demonstrate strong abilities in solving problems and evaluating proofs, they also exhibit systematic flaws, including a lack of self-critique and a model depending discrepancy between final-answer accuracy and full-proof validity.
  Based on these findings, we propose a durable framework for integrating AI into the research workflow, centered on the principle of the augmented mathematician. In this model, the AI functions as a copilot under the critical guidance of the human researcher, an approach distilled into five guiding principles for effective and responsible use. We then systematically explore seven fundamental ways AI can be applied across the research lifecycle, from creativity and ideation to the final writing process, demonstrating how these principles translate into concrete practice.
  We conclude that the primary role of AI is currently augmentation rather than automation. This requires a new skill set focused on strategic prompting, critical verification, and methodological rigor in order to effectively use these powerful tools.

Summary:<br />
- Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are important biomarkers for various neurological diseases.
- Manual segmentation of PVS is time-consuming and lacks reliability, leading to the need for automated methods.
- MedNeXt-L-k5, a convolutional network, was adapted for automated PVS segmentation on MRI scans.
- High voxel-level Dice scores were achieved on T2-weighted images but lower scores on T1-weighted images.
- The model showed efficiency across diverse datasets, although it did not outperform nnU-Net. <div>

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network, for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of 0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature. The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG). MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high accuracy in PVS segmentation.

Summary:
SwizzlePerf is a tool that provides hardware-aware optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures, improving performance by considering specific memory access patterns and architecture specifications. Unlike existing methods that rely on inefficient search-based approaches, SwizzlePerf incorporates hardware-awareness to generate tailored spatial optimizations based on historical performance and profiling data. In testing, SwizzlePerf outperformed expert performance engineers, taking less than 5 minutes to generate optimal swizzling patterns for a GEMM kernel that previously took 2 weeks. Across a range of ML and scientific kernels, SwizzlePerf achieved speedups of up to 2.06x and a 70% improvement in L2 hit rate for 9 out of 10 kernels. This work represents a significant step towards developing systematic hardware-aware performance engineering agents for large language models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown progress in GPU kernel performance engineering using inefficient search-based methods that optimize around runtime. Any existing approach lacks a key characteristic that human performance engineers rely on for near-optimal utilization -- hardware-awareness. By leveraging the workload's specific memory access patterns, architecture specifications, filtered profiling logs, and reflections on historical performance, we can make software-level optimizations that are tailored to the underlying hardware. SwizzlePerf automatically generates spatial optimizations for GPU kernels on disaggregated architectures by giving LLMs explicit hardware-awareness.
  For a GEMM kernel, SwizzlePerf takes less than 5 minutes to generate the same hardware-specific optimal swizzling pattern that took expert performance engineers 2 weeks to find. On a suite of 10 diverse ML and Science kernels, SwizzlePerf can generate swizzling patterns for 9 of the kernels that achieve up to a 2.06x speedup and 70% improvement in L2 hit rate. This work is the first of many steps toward systematically creating hardware-aware LLM performance engineering agents.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) were examined through a probing framework to analyze their processing dynamics at different layers. Linear classifiers were trained to predict visual categories from token embeddings at each layer, revealing a stage-wise structure in MLLM processing: early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers integrate lexical information and support semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. The framework was applied to various MLLMs, showing consistent stage-wise patterns across different variations. However, the specific layer allocation to each stage varied with changes in the base MLLM architecture. The study provides insights into the organization of MLLMs and offers a model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories (e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the vulnerability of Web and Research Agents (WRAs) to inference attacks by passive network adversaries. These language model-based systems, used for investigating complex topics on the Internet, are at risk of privacy breaches when deployed locally. By analyzing network-level metadata such as visited IP addresses and timings, a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack was developed. This attack successfully recovers over 73% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts and can accurately infer up to 19 latent traits in a multi-session setting. The effectiveness of the attack remains high even under partial observability and noisy conditions. Mitigation strategies, such as constraining domain diversity or obfuscating traces, are proposed to reduce the impact of the attack while maintaining usability, with an average effectiveness reduction of 29%. <div>

Abstract: We show that Web and Research Agents (WRAs) -- language model-based systems that investigate complex topics on the Internet -- are vulnerable to inference attacks by passive network adversaries such as ISPs. These agents could be deployed \emph{locally} by organizations and individuals for privacy, legal, or financial purposes. Unlike sporadic web browsing by humans, WRAs visit $70{-}140$ domains with distinguishable timing correlations, enabling unique fingerprinting attacks.
  Specifically, we demonstrate a novel prompt and user trait leakage attack against WRAs that only leverages their network-level metadata (i.e., visited IP addresses and their timings). We start by building a new dataset of WRA traces based on user search queries and queries generated by synthetic personas. We define a behavioral metric (called OBELS) to comprehensively assess similarity between original and inferred prompts, showing that our attack recovers over 73\% of the functional and domain knowledge of user prompts. Extending to a multi-session setting, we recover up to 19 of 32 latent traits with high accuracy. Our attack remains effective under partial observability and noisy conditions. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies that constrain domain diversity or obfuscate traces, showing negligible utility impact while reducing attack effectiveness by an average of 29\%.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC (value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation. Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration method.

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid. Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes (cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination (DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines, often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Abstract: The rise of AI has transformed the software and hardware landscape, enabling powerful capabilities through specialized infrastructures, large-scale data storage, and advanced hardware. However, these innovations introduce unique attack surfaces and objectives which traditional cybersecurity assessments often overlook. Cyber attackers are shifting their objectives from conventional goals like privilege escalation and network pivoting to manipulating AI outputs to achieve desired system effects, such as slowing system performance, flooding outputs with false positives, or degrading model accuracy. This paper serves to raise awareness of the novel cyber threats that are introduced when incorporating AI into a software system. We explore the operational cybersecurity and supply chain risks across the AI lifecycle, emphasizing the need for tailored security frameworks to address evolving threats in the AI-driven landscape. We highlight previous exploitations and provide insights from working in this area. By understanding these risks, organizations can better protect AI systems and ensure their reliability and resilience.

Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication? This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum computing applications.

<title>GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains, their potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal and regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines to promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are typically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in translating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.
  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\textbf{G}uideline \textbf{U}pholding Test through \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{R}ole-play and Jailbreak \textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize guidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM adherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of guideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby testing whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly violate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses that do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of ``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that provoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying potential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method finally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence and highlighting any violations.
  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs, including Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued guidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can transfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its usage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.

<title>Multi-View Graph Convolution Network for Internal Talent Recommendation Based on Enterprise Emails</title>

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations, often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data: WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW) data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical implications.

<title>Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of 23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

<title>Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators</title>

Abstract: Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars. During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators. This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity. Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.

<title>Adaptive Root Cause Localization for Microservice Systems with Multi-Agent Recursion-of-Thought</title>

Abstract: As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent, an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process, effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root cause localization in complex microservice environments.

Abstract: Reasoning Large Language Models (RLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress on complex reasoning tasks, largely enabled by their long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) capabilities. However, developing these Long CoT behaviors relies heavily on post-training with high-quality datasets, which are typically costly and human-curated (e.g., mathematics and code), leaving scalable alternatives unexplored. In this work, we introduce NP-hard (NPH) graph problems as a novel synthetic training corpus, as they inherently require deep reasoning, extensive exploration, and reflective strategies, which are core characteristics of Long CoT reasoning. Building on this insight, we develop a two-stage post-training framework: (i) Long CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on rejection-sampled NPH graph instances, which substantially enhances reasoning depth, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a fine-grained reward design, which sharpens reasoning efficiency. Our flagship model, Graph-R1-7B, demonstrates strong generalization across mathematics, coding, STEM, and logic, and surpasses QwQ-32B on NPH graph problems in both accuracy and reasoning efficiency. These results position NPH graph problems as an effective and scalable resource for advancing Long CoT reasoning in LLMs, opening a new frontier for LLM post-training. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/Graph-Reasoner/Graph-R1, with models and datasets hosted in our Hugging Face collection HKUST-DSAIL/Graph-R1.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks. Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps. Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low latency (within 5 time-steps).

<title>Measuring Reasoning Utility in LLMs via Conditional Entropy Reduction</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) often rely on generating intermediate reasoning steps to enhance accuracy. However, little work has examined how reasoning utility contributes to the final answer's correctness. Due to the stochastic nature of autoregressive generation, generating more context does not guarantee increased confidence in the answer. If we could predict, during generation, whether a reasoning step will be useful, we could stop early or prune ineffective steps, avoiding distractions in the final decision.
  We present an oracle study on MATH dataset, using Qwen2.5-32B and GPT-4o to generate reasoning chains, and then employing a separate model (Qwen3-8B) to quantify the utility of these chains for final accuracy. Specifically, we measure the model's uncertainty on the answer span Y at each reasoning step using conditional entropy (expected negative log-likelihood over the vocabulary) with context expanding step by step. Our results show a clear pattern: conditional entropy that decreases over steps is strongly associated with correct answers, whereas flat or increasing entropy often results in wrong answers. We also corroborate that incorrect reasoning paths tend to be longer than correct ones, suggesting that longer reasoning does not necessarily yield better outcomes. These findings serve as a foundation to inspire future work on designing efficient reasoning pipelines that detect and avoid unproductive reasoning early.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins, enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First, an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation; second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for industrial recommendation systems.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and medical LLMs (Med-LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on general medical benchmarks. However, their capabilities in specialized medical fields, such as dentistry which require deeper domain-specific knowledge, remain underexplored due to the lack of targeted evaluation resources. In this paper, we introduce DentalBench, the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate and advance LLMs in the dental domain. DentalBench consists of two main components: DentalQA, an English-Chinese question-answering (QA) benchmark with 36,597 questions spanning 4 tasks and 16 dental subfields; and DentalCorpus, a large-scale, high-quality corpus with 337.35 million tokens curated for dental domain adaptation, supporting both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We evaluate 14 LLMs, covering proprietary, open-source, and medical-specific models, and reveal significant performance gaps across task types and languages. Further experiments with Qwen-2.5-3B demonstrate that domain adaptation substantially improves model performance, particularly on knowledge-intensive and terminology-focused tasks, and highlight the importance of domain-specific benchmarks for developing trustworthy and effective LLMs tailored to healthcare applications.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance. Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model.

<title>On Identifying Why and When Foundation Models Perform Well on Time-Series Forecasting Using Automated Explanations and Rating</title>

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences. Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy, transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power, car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on very large datasets as PathX-256.

<title>Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via Entanglement-Aware Unlearning with Proxy Constraint</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns, data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement. We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets, revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data, especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their evaluation in realistic scenarios.

<title>Dual-Model Weight Selection and Self-Knowledge Distillation for Medical Image Classification</title>

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost, followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans, and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a neural network based on the Ising model, well known for its ability to learn probability distributions and stochastically generate new content. However, the high computational cost of Gibbs sampling in content generation tasks imposes significant bottlenecks on electronic implementations. Here, we propose a photonic restricted Boltzmann machine (PRBM) that leverages photonic computing to accelerate Gibbs sampling, enabling efficient content generation. By introducing an efficient encoding method, the PRBM eliminates the need for computationally intensive matrix decomposition and reduces the computational complexity of Gibbs sampling from $O(N)$ to $O(1)$. Moreover, its non-Von Neumann photonic computing architecture circumvents the memory storage of interaction matrices, providing substantial advantages for large-scale RBMs. We experimentally validate the photonic-accelerated Gibbs sampling by simulating a two-dimensional Ising model, where the observed phase transition temperature closely matches the theoretical predictions. Beyond physics-inspired tasks, the PRBM demonstrates robust capabilities in generating and restoring diverse content, including images and temporal sequences, even in the presence of noise and aberrations. The scalability and reduced training cost of the PRBM framework underscore its potential as a promising pathway for advancing photonic computing in generative artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers' shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory, limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot. CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore, based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Abstract: Multilingual machine translation (MT) benchmarks play a central role in evaluating the capabilities of modern MT systems. Among them, the FLORES+ benchmark is widely used, offering English-to-many translation data for over 200 languages, curated with strict quality control protocols. However, we study data in four languages (Asante Twi, Japanese, Jinghpaw, and South Azerbaijani) and uncover critical shortcomings in the benchmark's suitability for truly multilingual evaluation. Human assessments reveal that many translations fall below the claimed 90% quality standard, and the annotators report that source sentences are often too domain-specific and culturally biased toward the English-speaking world. We further demonstrate that simple heuristics, such as copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU scores, suggesting vulnerabilities in the evaluation protocol. Notably, we show that MT models trained on high-quality, naturalistic data perform poorly on FLORES+ while achieving significant gains on our domain-relevant evaluation set. Based on these findings, we advocate for multilingual MT benchmarks that use domain-general and culturally neutral source texts rely less on named entities, in order to better reflect real-world translation challenges.

<title>BridgeShield: Enhancing Security for Cross-chain Bridge Applications via Heterogeneous Graph Mining</title>

Abstract: Cross-chain bridges play a vital role in enabling blockchain interoperability. However, due to the inherent design flaws and the enormous value they hold, they have become prime targets for hacker attacks. Existing detection methods show progress yet remain limited, as they mainly address single-chain behaviors and fail to capture cross-chain semantics. To address this gap, we leverage heterogeneous graph attention networks, which are well-suited for modeling multi-typed entities and relations, to capture the complex execution semantics of cross-chain behaviors. We propose BridgeShield, a detection framework that jointly models the source chain, off-chain coordination, and destination chain within a unified heterogeneous graph representation. BridgeShield incorporates intra-meta-path attention to learn fine-grained dependencies within cross-chain paths and inter-meta-path attention to highlight discriminative cross-chain patterns, thereby enabling precise identification of attack behaviors. Extensive experiments on 51 real-world cross-chain attack events demonstrate that BridgeShield achieves an average F1-score of 92.58%, representing a 24.39% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate the effectiveness of BridgeShield as a practical solution for securing cross-chain bridges and enhancing the resilience of multi-chain ecosystems.

<title>MM-HSD: Multi-Modal Hate Speech Detection in Videos</title>

Abstract: While hate speech detection (HSD) has been extensively studied in text, existing multi-modal approaches remain limited, particularly in videos. As modalities are not always individually informative, simple fusion methods fail to fully capture inter-modal dependencies. Moreover, previous work often omits relevant modalities such as on-screen text and audio, which may contain subtle hateful content and thus provide essential cues, both individually and in combination with others. In this paper, we present MM-HSD, a multi-modal model for HSD in videos that integrates video frames, audio, and text derived from speech transcripts and from frames (i.e.~on-screen text) together with features extracted by Cross-Modal Attention (CMA). We are the first to use CMA as an early feature extractor for HSD in videos, to systematically compare query/key configurations, and to evaluate the interactions between different modalities in the CMA block. Our approach leads to improved performance when on-screen text is used as a query and the rest of the modalities serve as a key. Experiments on the HateMM dataset show that MM-HSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on M-F1 score (0.874), using concatenation of transcript, audio, video, on-screen text, and CMA for feature extraction on raw embeddings of the modalities.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency, representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in interactive grasping scenarios. These results confirm SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis. Code is available at https://github.com/sejmoonwei/SPGrasp.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality, multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets. Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly generalizable medical AI.

Abstract: The widespread success of pre-trained language models has established a new training paradigm, where a global PLM is fine-tuned using task-specific data from local clients. The local data are highly different from each other and can not capture the global distribution of the whole data in real world. To address the challenges of non-IID data in real environments, privacy-preserving federated distillation has been proposed and highly investigated. However, previous experimental non-IID scenarios are primarily identified with the label (output) diversity, without considering the diversity of language domains (input) that is crucial in natural language processing. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive set of multi-domain non-IID scenarios and propose a unified benchmarking framework that includes diverse data. The benchmark can be used to evaluate the federated learning framework in a real environment. To this end, we propose an Adaptive Federated Distillation (AdaFD) framework designed to address multi-domain non-IID challenges in both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our models capture the diversity of local clients and achieve better performance compared to the existing works. The code for this paper is available at: https://github.com/jiahaoxiao1228/AdaFD.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.

<title>MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model Large-batch Training</title>

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights. Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures. Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2 models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens. This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling faster development and iteration of large language models.

Abstract: Developments in Graph-Language Models (GLMs) aim to integrate the structural reasoning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with the semantic understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, we demonstrate that current evaluation benchmarks for GLMs, which are primarily repurposed node-level classification datasets, are insufficient to assess multimodal reasoning. Our analysis reveals that strong performance on these benchmarks is achievable using unimodal information alone, suggesting that they do not necessitate graph-language integration. To address this evaluation gap, we introduce the CLEGR(Compositional Language-Graph Reasoning) benchmark, designed to evaluate multimodal reasoning at various complexity levels. Our benchmark employs a synthetic graph generation pipeline paired with questions that require joint reasoning over structure and textual semantics. We perform a thorough evaluation of representative GLM architectures and find that soft-prompted LLM baselines perform on par with GLMs that incorporate a full GNN backbone. This result calls into question the architectural necessity of incorporating graph structure into LLMs. We further show that GLMs exhibit significant performance degradation in tasks that require structural reasoning. These findings highlight limitations in the graph reasoning capabilities of current GLMs and provide a foundation for advancing the community toward explicit multimodal reasoning involving graph structure and language.

Abstract: Current flow-based generative speech enhancement methods learn curved probability paths which model a mapping between clean and noisy speech. Despite impressive performance, the implications of curved probability paths are unknown. Methods such as Schrodinger bridges focus on curved paths, where time-dependent gradients and variance do not promote straight paths. Findings in machine learning research suggest that straight paths, such as conditional flow matching, are easier to train and offer better generalisation. In this paper we quantify the effect of path straightness on speech enhancement quality. We report experiments with the Schrodinger bridge, where we show that certain configurations lead to straighter paths. Conversely, we propose independent conditional flow-matching for speech enhancement, which models straight paths between noisy and clean speech. We demonstrate empirically that a time-independent variance has a greater effect on sample quality than the gradient. Although conditional flow matching improves several speech quality metrics, it requires multiple inference steps. We rectify this with a one-step solution by inferring the trained flow-based model as if it was directly predictive. Our work suggests that straighter time-independent probability paths improve generative speech enhancement over curved time-dependent paths.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians, offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent, and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them. However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11, SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time, high-risk industrial environments.

<title>Amadeus: Autoregressive Model with Bidirectional Attribute Modelling for Symbolic Music</title>

Abstract: Existing state-of-the-art symbolic music generation models predominantly adopt autoregressive or hierarchical autoregressive architectures, modelling symbolic music as a sequence of attribute tokens with unidirectional temporal dependencies, under the assumption of a fixed, strict dependency structure among these attributes. However, we observe that using different attributes as the initial token in these models leads to comparable performance. This suggests that the attributes of a musical note are, in essence, a concurrent and unordered set, rather than a temporally dependent sequence. Based on this insight, we introduce Amadeus, a novel symbolic music generation framework. Amadeus adopts a two-level architecture: an autoregressive model for note sequences and a bidirectional discrete diffusion model for attributes. To enhance performance, we propose Music Latent Space Discriminability Enhancement Strategy(MLSDES), incorporating contrastive learning constraints that amplify discriminability of intermediate music representations. The Conditional Information Enhancement Module (CIEM) simultaneously strengthens note latent vector representation via attention mechanisms, enabling more precise note decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on unconditional and text-conditioned generation tasks. Amadeus significantly outperforms SOTA models across multiple metrics while achieving at least 4$\times$ speed-up. Furthermore, we demonstrate training-free, fine-grained note attribute control feasibility using our model. To explore the upper performance bound of the Amadeus architecture, we compile the largest open-source symbolic music dataset to date, AMD (Amadeus MIDI Dataset), supporting both pre-training and fine-tuning.

Abstract: Enabling multiple autonomous machines to perform reliably requires the development of efficient cooperative control algorithms. This paper presents a survey of algorithms that have been developed for controlling and coordinating autonomous machines in complex environments. We especially focus on task allocation methods using computational intelligence (CI) and deep reinforcement learning (RL). The advantages and disadvantages of the surveyed methods are analysed thoroughly. We also propose and discuss in detail various future research directions that shed light on how to improve existing algorithms or create new methods to enhance the employability and performance of autonomous machines in real-world applications. The findings indicate that CI and deep RL methods provide viable approaches to addressing complex task allocation problems in dynamic and uncertain environments. The recent development of deep RL has greatly contributed to the literature on controlling and coordinating autonomous machines, and it has become a growing trend in this area. It is envisaged that this paper will provide researchers and engineers with a comprehensive overview of progress in machine learning research related to autonomous machines. It also highlights underexplored areas, identifies emerging methodologies, and suggests new avenues for exploration in future research within this domain.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient, scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe 2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition systems often fail to transcribe domain-specific named entities, causing catastrophic failures in downstream tasks. Numerous fast and lightweight named entity correction (NEC) models have been proposed in recent years. These models, mainly leveraging phonetic-level edit distance algorithms, have shown impressive performances. However, when the forms of the wrongly-transcribed words(s) and the ground-truth entity are significantly different, these methods often fail to locate the wrongly transcribed words in hypothesis, thus limiting their usage. We propose a novel NEC method that utilizes speech sound features to retrieve candidate entities. With speech sound features and candidate entities, we inovatively design a generative method to annotate entity errors in ASR transcripts and replace the text with correct entities. This method is effective in scenarios of word form difference. We test our method using open-source and self-constructed test sets. The results demonstrate that our NEC method can bring significant improvement to entity accuracy. We will open source our self-constructed test set and training data.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks, particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its generalizability and practical utility.

Abstract: Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation, tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism, dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer: directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics, and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate}, and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring. Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}} (AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters, enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is available at: https://github.com/YuhsiHu/C3-GS.

<title>Provable Benefits of In-Tool Learning for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored. In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization) for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones. We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

<title>SeqVLM: Proposal-Guided Multi-View Sequences Reasoning via VLM for Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding</title>

arXiv:2508.20758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements. However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%, respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model performance.

<title>Looking Beyond the Obvious: A Survey on Abstract Concept Recognition for Video Understanding</title>

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation models.

<title>Turning the Spell Around: Lightweight Alignment Amplification via Rank-One Safety Injection</title>

Abstract: Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper, we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box method that amplifies a model's safety alignment by permanently steering its activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple, fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU, HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align 'uncensored' models by amplifying their own latent safety directions, demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive fine-tuning paradigms.

Abstract: Rising mental health issues among youth have increased interest in automated approaches for detecting early signs of psychological distress in digital text. One key focus is the identification of cognitive distortions, irrational thought patterns that have a role in aggravating mental distress. Early detection of these distortions may enable timely, low-cost interventions. While prior work has focused on English clinical data, we present the first in-depth study of cross-lingual and cross-register generalization of cognitive distortion detection, analyzing forum posts written by Dutch adolescents. Our findings show that while changes in language and writing style can significantly affect model performance, domain adaptation methods show the most promise.

Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts. Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years, however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models -- Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of relational concepts such as left and right.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations. To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework for speech emotion recognition that leverages entropy-aware score selection to combine speech and textual predictions. The proposed method integrates a primary pipeline that consists of an acoustic model based on wav2vec2.0 and a secondary pipeline that consists of a sentiment analysis model using RoBERTa-XLM, with transcriptions generated via Whisper-large-v3. We propose a late score fusion approach based on entropy and varentropy thresholds to overcome the confidence constraints of primary pipeline predictions. A sentiment mapping strategy translates three sentiment categories into four target emotion classes, enabling coherent integration of multimodal predictions. The results on the IEMOCAP and MSP-IMPROV datasets show that the proposed method offers a practical and reliable enhancement over traditional single-modality systems.

Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of each type of model in capturing depression-related signals across modalities, offering insights into effective multimodal representation strategies for mental health prediction.

<title>Uncertainty Aware-Predictive Control Barrier Functions: Safer Human Robot Interaction through Probabilistic Motion Forecasting</title>

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion: when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms, limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation, UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence). Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: AI-powered development platforms are making software creation accessible to a broader audience, but this democratization has triggered a scalability crisis in security auditing. With studies showing that up to 40% of AI-generated code contains vulnerabilities, the pace of development now vastly outstrips the capacity for thorough security assessment.
  We present MAPTA, a multi-agent system for autonomous web application security assessment that combines large language model orchestration with tool-grounded execution and end-to-end exploit validation. On the 104-challenge XBOW benchmark, MAPTA achieves 76.9% overall success with perfect performance on SSRF and misconfiguration vulnerabilities, 83% success on broken authorization, and strong results on injection attacks including server-side template injection (85%) and SQL injection (83%). Cross-site scripting (57%) and blind SQL injection (0%) remain challenging. Our comprehensive cost analysis across all challenges totals $21.38 with a median cost of $0.073 for successful attempts versus $0.357 for failures. Success correlates strongly with resource efficiency, enabling practical early-stopping thresholds at approximately 40 tool calls or $0.30 per challenge.
  MAPTA's real-world findings are impactful given both the popularity of the respective scanned GitHub repositories (8K-70K stars) and MAPTA's low average operating cost of $3.67 per open-source assessment: MAPTA discovered critical vulnerabilities including RCEs, command injections, secret exposure, and arbitrary file write vulnerabilities. Findings are responsibly disclosed, 10 findings are under CVE review.

<title>Learning Primitive Embodied World Models: Towards Scalable Robotic Learning</title>

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4) decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

<title>JADES: A Universal Framework for Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring</title>

Abstract: Accurately determining whether a jailbreak attempt has succeeded is a fundamental yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods rely on misaligned proxy indicators or naive holistic judgments. They frequently misinterpret model responses, leading to inconsistent and subjective assessments that misalign with human perception. To address this gap, we introduce JADES (Jailbreak Assessment via Decompositional Scoring), a universal jailbreak evaluation framework. Its key mechanism is to automatically decompose an input harmful question into a set of weighted sub-questions, score each sub-answer, and weight-aggregate the sub-scores into a final decision. JADES also incorporates an optional fact-checking module to strengthen the detection of hallucinations in jailbreak responses. We validate JADES on JailbreakQR, a newly introduced benchmark proposed in this work, consisting of 400 pairs of jailbreak prompts and responses, each meticulously annotated by humans. In a binary setting (success/failure), JADES achieves 98.5% agreement with human evaluators, outperforming strong baselines by over 9%. Re-evaluating five popular attacks on four LLMs reveals substantial overestimation (e.g., LAA's attack success rate on GPT-3.5-Turbo drops from 93% to 69%). Our results show that JADES could deliver accurate, consistent, and interpretable evaluations, providing a reliable basis for measuring future jailbreak attacks.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems and the sophistication of cyber-attacks have underscored the critical need for effective automated vulnerability detection and repair systems. Traditional methods, such as static program analysis, face significant challenges related to scalability, adaptability, and high false-positive and false-negative rates. AI-driven approaches, particularly those using machine learning and deep learning models, show promise but are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of training data. This paper introduces a novel framework designed to automatically introduce realistic, category-specific vulnerabilities into secure C/C++ codebases to generate datasets. The proposed approach coordinates multiple AI agents that simulate expert reasoning, along with function agents and traditional code analysis tools. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation for contextual grounding and employs Low-Rank approximation of weights for efficient model fine-tuning. Our experimental study on 116 code samples from three different benchmarks suggests that our approach outperforms other techniques with regard to dataset accuracy, achieving between 89\% and 95\% success rates in injecting vulnerabilities at function level.

Abstract: Qiskit is an open-source quantum computing framework that allows users to design, simulate, and run quantum circuits on real quantum hardware. We explore post-training techniques for LLMs to assist in writing Qiskit code. We introduce quantum verification as an effective method for ensuring code quality and executability on quantum hardware. To support this, we developed a synthetic data pipeline that generates quantum problem-unit test pairs and used it to create preference data for aligning LLMs with DPO. Additionally, we trained models using GRPO, leveraging quantum-verifiable rewards provided by the quantum hardware. Our best-performing model, combining DPO and GRPO, surpasses the strongest open-source baselines on the challenging Qiskit-HumanEval-hard benchmark.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become essential for applications such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and automated question-answering. Recently, LLMs have also been integrated into relational database management systems to enhance querying and support advanced data processing. Companies such as Amazon, Databricks, Google, and Snowflake offer LLM invocation directly within SQL, denoted as LLM queries, to boost data insights. However, open-source solutions currently have limited functionality and poor performance. In this work, we present an early exploration of two open-source systems and one enterprise platform, using five representative queries to expose functional, performance, and scalability limits in today's SQL-invoked LLM integrations. We identify three main issues: enforcing structured outputs, optimizing resource utilization, and improving query planning. We implemented initial solutions and observed improvements in accommodating LLM powered SQL queries. These early gains demonstrate that tighter integration of LLM+DBMS is the key to scalable and efficient processing of LLM queries.

Abstract: Proactive dialogue has emerged as a critical and challenging research problem in advancing large language models (LLMs). Existing works predominantly focus on domain-specific or task-oriented scenarios, which leads to fragmented evaluations and limits the comprehensive exploration of models' proactive conversation abilities. In this work, we propose ProactiveEval, a unified framework designed for evaluating proactive dialogue capabilities of LLMs. This framework decomposes proactive dialogue into target planning and dialogue guidance, establishing evaluation metrics across various domains. Moreover, it also enables the automatic generation of diverse and challenging evaluation data. Based on the proposed framework, we develop 328 evaluation environments spanning 6 distinct domains. Through experiments with 22 different types of LLMs, we show that DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet exhibit exceptional performance on target planning and dialogue guidance tasks, respectively. Finally, we investigate how reasoning capabilities influence proactive behaviors and discuss their implications for future model development.

Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in LALMs.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods, offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at https://github.com/patrick-bedkowski/expertsim-mix-of-generative-experts.

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety, thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree (DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs. DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage: https://sites.google.com/view/ditree.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs, and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine across diverse domains.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences, compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering. Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG is publicly available at the Github: https://github.com/jinluo12345/Reinforcement-learning-guidance.

Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) radically expands the scope and capability of automation for work, education, and everyday tasks, a transformation posing both risks and opportunities for human cognition. How will human cognition change, and what opportunities are there for GenAI to augment it? Which theories, metrics, and other tools are needed to address these questions? The CHI 2025 workshop on Tools for Thought aimed to bridge an emerging science of how the use of GenAI affects human thought, from metacognition to critical thinking, memory, and creativity, with an emerging design practice for building GenAI tools that both protect and augment human thought. Fifty-six researchers, designers, and thinkers from across disciplines as well as industry and academia, along with 34 papers and portfolios, seeded a day of discussion, ideation, and community-building. We synthesize this material here to begin mapping the space of research and design opportunities and to catalyze a multidisciplinary community around this pressing area of research.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice, typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures, emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource, we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as "planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains. Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Abstract: According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle, localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods for partial video manipulations.

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

Abstract: As multi-turn dialogues with large language models (LLMs) grow longer and more complex, how can users better evaluate and review progress on their conversational goals? We present OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that helps users better manage goal progress. OnGoal provides real-time feedback on goal alignment through LLM-assisted evaluation, explanations for evaluation results with examples, and overviews of goal progression over time, enabling users to navigate complex dialogues more effectively. Through a study with 20 participants on a writing task, we evaluate OnGoal against a baseline chat interface without goal tracking. Using OnGoal, participants spent less time and effort to achieve their goals while exploring new prompting strategies to overcome miscommunication, suggesting tracking and visualizing goals can enhance engagement and resilience in LLM dialogues. Our findings inspired design implications for future LLM chat interfaces that improve goal communication, reduce cognitive load, enhance interactivity, and enable feedback to improve LLM performance.

Abstract: Creating assembly products demands significant manual effort and expert knowledge in 1) designing the assembly and 2) constructing the product. This paper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates real-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of creating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements, Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products, bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user study, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from imaginative ideas.

Abstract: Optimization problems are pervasive in sectors from manufacturing and distribution to healthcare. However, most such problems are still solved heuristically by hand rather than optimally by state-of-the-art solvers because the expertise required to formulate and solve these problems limits the widespread adoption of optimization tools and techniques. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based system designed to formulate and solve (mixed integer) linear programming problems from their natural language descriptions. Our system is capable of developing mathematical models, writing and debugging solver code, evaluating the generated solutions, and improving efficiency and correctness of its model and code based on these evaluations. OptiMUS-0.3 utilizes a modular structure to process problems, allowing it to handle problems with long descriptions and complex data without long prompts. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMUS-0.3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on easy datasets by more than 22% and on hard datasets (including a new dataset, NLP4LP, released with this paper that features long and complex problems) by more than 24%.

Abstract: This paper offers a roadmap for the development of scalable aligned artificial intelligence (AI) from first principle descriptions of natural intelligence. In brief, a possible path toward scalable aligned AI rests upon enabling artificial agents to learn a good model of the world that includes a good model of our preferences. For this, the main objective is creating agents that learn to represent the world and other agents' world models; a problem that falls under structure learning (a.k.a. causal representation learning or model discovery). We expose the structure learning and alignment problems with this goal in mind, as well as principles to guide us forward, synthesizing various ideas across mathematics, statistics, and cognitive science. 1) We discuss the essential role of core knowledge, information geometry and model reduction in structure learning, and suggest core structural modules to learn a wide range of naturalistic worlds. 2) We outline a way toward aligned agents through structure learning and theory of mind. As an illustrative example, we mathematically sketch Asimov's Laws of Robotics, which prescribe agents to act cautiously to minimize the ill-being of other agents. We supplement this example by proposing refined approaches to alignment. These observations may guide the development of artificial intelligence in helping to scale existing -- or design new -- aligned structure learning systems.

<title>Technology as uncharted territory: Contextual integrity and the notion of AI as new ethical ground</title>

Abstract: Recent research illustrates how AI can be developed and deployed in a manner detached from the concrete social context of application. By abstracting from the contexts of AI application, practitioners also disengage from the distinct normative structures that govern them. Building upon Helen Nissenbaum's framework of contextual integrity, I illustrate how disregard for contextual norms can threaten the integrity of a context with often decisive ethical implications. I argue that efforts to promote responsible and ethical AI can inadvertently contribute to and seemingly legitimize this disregard for established contextual norms. Echoing a persistent undercurrent in technology ethics of understanding emerging technologies as uncharted moral territory, certain approaches to AI ethics can promote a notion of AI as a novel and distinct realm for ethical deliberation, norm setting, and virtue cultivation. This narrative of AI as new ethical ground, however, can come at the expense of practitioners, policymakers and ethicists engaging with already established norms and virtues that were gradually cultivated to promote successful and responsible practice within concrete social contexts. In response, I question the current narrow prioritization in AI ethics of moral innovation over moral preservation. Engaging also with emerging foundation models, I advocate for a moderately conservative approach to the ethics of AI that prioritizes the responsible and considered integration of AI within established social contexts and their respective normative structures.

<title>Can Large Language Models Develop Strategic Reasoning? Post-training Insights from Learning Chess</title>

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) has shown promise in mathematical reasoning, strategic reasoning for LLMs using RL remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether LLMs can develop strategic reasoning capabilities through RL in chess. To this end, we leverage a chess-pretrained action-value network to provide dense reward on the LLM's output move quality, which can be seen as a form of knowledge distillation. Our experiments show that our distillation-based dense rewards often outperform sparse binary rewards. However, surprisingly, all models plateau far below expert levels. We provide SFT and RL ablations on chess reasoning training and find evidence that this limitation stems from a deficit in the pretrained models' internal understanding of chess-a deficit which RL alone may not be able to fully overcome. The code is available at https://github.com/krafton-ai/Chess-R1.

Abstract: Gravitational-wave signal detection with unknown source parameters buried in dynamic detector noise remains a formidable computational challenge. Existing approaches face core limitations from restrictive assumptions: traditional methods rely on predefined theoretical priors, while neural networks introduce hidden biases and lack interpretability. We propose Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), the first integration of large language model (LLM) guidance with domain-aware physical constraints for automated gravitational wave detection. This framework systematically explores algorithmic solution spaces through tree-structured search enhanced by evolutionary optimization, combining MCTS for strategic exploration with evolutionary algorithms for solution refinement. The LLM component provides domain-aware heuristics while maintaining interpretability through explicit algorithmic pathway generation. Experimental validation demonstrates substantial performance improvements, achieving a 20.2% improvement over state-of-the-art gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset and a remarkable 59.1% improvement over other LLM-based algorithm optimization frameworks. Beyond performance improvements, our framework establishes a transferable methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science domains.

<title>MSARL: Decoupling Reasoning and Tool Use with Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems highlight the potential of specialized small agents that collaborate via division of labor. Existing tool-integrated reasoning systems, however, often follow a single-agent paradigm in which one large model interleaves long-horizon reasoning with precise tool operations, leading to cognitive-load interference and unstable coordination. We present MSARL, a Multi-Small-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework that explicitly decouples reasoning from tool use. In MSARL, a Reasoning Agent decomposes problems and plans tool invocations, while multiple Tool Agents specialize in specific external tools, each trained via a combination of imitation learning and reinforcement learning with role-specific rewards. On mathematical problem solving with code execution, MSARL significantly improves reasoning stability and final-answer accuracy over single-agent baselines. Moreover, the architecture generalizes to diverse tool-use tasks, demonstrating that cognitive-role decoupling with small agents is a scalable blueprint for multi-agent AI design.

Abstract: Deep Learning and Machine Learning based models have become extremely popular in text processing and information retrieval. However, the non-linear structures present inside the networks make these models largely inscrutable. A significant body of research has focused on increasing the transparency of these models. This article provides a broad overview of research on the explainability and interpretability of natural language processing and information retrieval methods. More specifically, we survey approaches that have been applied to explain word embeddings, sequence modeling, attention modules, transformers, BERT, and document ranking.

Abstract: Inspired by humans comprehending speech in a multi-modal manner, various audio-visual datasets have been constructed. However, most existing datasets focus on English, induce dependencies with various prediction models during dataset preparation, and have only a small number of multi-view videos. To mitigate the limitations, we recently developed the Open Large-scale Korean Audio-Visual Speech (OLKAVS) dataset, which is the largest among publicly available audio-visual speech datasets. The dataset contains 1,150 hours of transcribed audio from 1,107 Korean speakers in a studio setup with nine different viewpoints and various noise situations. We also provide the pre-trained baseline models for two tasks, audio-visual speech recognition and lip reading. We conducted experiments based on the models to verify the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-view training over uni-modal and frontal-view-only training. We expect the OLKAVS dataset to facilitate multi-modal research in broader areas such as Korean speech recognition, speaker recognition, pronunciation level classification, and mouth motion analysis.

Abstract: All data on the Internet are transferred by network traffic, thus accurately modeling network traffic can help improve network services quality and protect data privacy. Pretrained models for network traffic can utilize large-scale raw data to learn the essential characteristics of network traffic, and generate distinguishable results for input traffic without considering specific downstream tasks. Effective pretrained models can significantly optimize the training efficiency and effectiveness of downstream tasks, such as application classification, attack detection and traffic generation. Despite the great success of pretraining in natural language processing, there is no work in the network field. Considering the diverse demands and characteristics of network traffic and network tasks, it is non-trivial to build a pretrained model for network traffic and we face various challenges, especially the heterogeneous headers and payloads in the multi-pattern network traffic and the different dependencies for contexts of diverse downstream network tasks.
  To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we make the first attempt to provide a generative pretrained model NetGPT for both traffic understanding and generation tasks. We propose the multi-pattern network traffic modeling to construct unified text inputs and support both traffic understanding and generation tasks. We further optimize the adaptation effect of the pretrained model to diversified tasks by shuffling header fields, segmenting packets in flows, and incorporating diverse task labels with prompts. With diverse traffic datasets from encrypted software, DNS, private industrial protocols and cryptocurrency mining, expensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our NetGPT in a range of traffic understanding and generation tasks on traffic datasets, and outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a wide margin.

Abstract: Social networks profoundly influence how humans form opinions, exchange information, and organize collectively. As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into social and professional environments, it is critical to understand whether their interactions approximate human-like network dynamics. We develop a framework to study the network formation behaviors of multiple LLM agents and benchmark them against human decisions. Across synthetic and real-world settings, including friendship, telecommunication, and employment networks, we find that LLMs consistently reproduce fundamental micro-level principles such as preferential attachment, triadic closure, and homophily, as well as macro-level properties including community structure and small-world effects. Importantly, the relative emphasis of these principles adapts to context: for example, LLMs favor homophily in friendship networks but heterophily in organizational settings, mirroring patterns of social mobility. A controlled human-subject survey confirms strong alignment between LLMs and human participants in link-formation decisions. These results establish that LLMs can serve as powerful tools for social simulation and synthetic data generation, while also raising critical questions about bias, fairness, and the design of AI systems that participate in human networks.

<title>Rethinking Invariance Regularization in Adversarial Training to Improve Robustness-Accuracy Trade-off</title>

arXiv:2402.14648v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training often suffers from a robustness-accuracy trade-off, where achieving high robustness comes at the cost of accuracy. One approach to mitigate this trade-off is leveraging invariance regularization, which encourages model invariance under adversarial perturbations; however, it still leads to accuracy loss. In this work, we closely analyze the challenges of using invariance regularization in adversarial training and understand how to address them. Our analysis identifies two key issues: (1) a ``gradient conflict" between invariance and classification objectives, leading to suboptimal convergence, and (2) the mixture distribution problem arising from diverged distributions between clean and adversarial inputs. To address these issues, we propose Asymmetric Representation-regularized Adversarial Training (ARAT), which incorporates asymmetric invariance loss with stop-gradient operation and a predictor to avoid gradient conflict, and a split-BatchNorm (BN) structure to resolve the mixture distribution problem. Our detailed analysis demonstrates that each component effectively addresses the identified issues, offering novel insights into adversarial defense. ARAT shows superiority over existing methods across various settings. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings to knowledge distillation-based defenses, providing a new perspective on their relative successes.

<title>Investigating the Robustness of Counterfactual Learning to Rank Models: A Reproducibility Study</title>

arXiv:2404.03707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) has attracted extensive attention in the IR community for its ability to leverage massive logged user interaction data to train ranking models. While the CLTR models can be theoretically unbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity estimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated via simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely available, large-scale, real click logs. However, many previous simulation-based experiments are somewhat limited because they may have one or more of the following deficiencies: 1) using a weak production ranker to generate initial ranked lists, 2) relying on a simplified user simulation model to simulate user clicks, and 3) generating a fixed number of synthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and diverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation.
  To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness of existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive simulation-based experiments that (1) use production rankers with different ranking performance, (2) leverage multiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions, and (3) generate different numbers of synthetic sessions for the training queries. We find that the IPS-DCM, DLA-PBM, and UPE models show better robustness under various simulation settings than other CLTR models. Moreover, existing CLTR models often fail to outperform naive click baselines when the production ranker is strong and the number of training sessions is limited, indicating a pressing need for new CLTR algorithms tailored to these conditions.

Abstract: Applying large language models (LLMs) for academic API usage shows promise in reducing researchers' academic information seeking efforts. However, current LLM API-using methods struggle with complex API coupling commonly encountered in academic queries. To address this, we introduce SoAy, a solution-based LLM API-using methodology for academic information seeking. It uses code with a solution as the reasoning method, where a solution is a pre-constructed API calling sequence. The addition of the solution reduces the difficulty for the model to understand the complex relationships between APIs. Code improves the efficiency of reasoning.
  To evaluate SoAy, we introduce SoAyBench, an evaluation benchmark accompanied by SoAyEval, built upon a cloned environment of APIs from AMiner. Experimental results demonstrate a 34.58-75.99\% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art LLM API-based baselines. All datasets, codes, tuned models, and deployed online services are publicly accessible at https://github.com/RUCKBReasoning/SoAy.

<title>FFHFlow: Diverse and Uncertainty-Aware Dexterous Grasp Generation via Flow Variational Inference</title>

arXiv:2407.15161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synthesizing diverse, uncertainty-aware grasps for multi-fingered hands from partial observations remains a critical challenge in robot learning. Prior generative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of dexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in partial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We propose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse, robust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty in the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based deep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming the mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational Autoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of flows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and identifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To further enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with the flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that prioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in simulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and success rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its practical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven sampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page: https://sites.google.com/view/ffhflow/home/).

arXiv:2408.04631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Puppet-Master, an interactive video generator that captures the internal, part-level motion of objects, serving as a proxy for modeling object dynamics universally. Given an image of an object and a set of "drags" specifying the trajectory of a few points on the object, the model synthesizes a video where the object's parts move accordingly. To build Puppet-Master, we extend a pre-trained image-to-video generator to encode the input drags. We also propose all-to-first attention, an alternative to conventional spatial attention that mitigates artifacts caused by fine-tuning a video generator on out-of-domain data. The model is fine-tuned on Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips obtained by rendering synthetic 3D animations. Unlike real videos, these synthetic clips avoid confounding part-level motion with overall object and camera motion. We extensively filter sub-optimal animations and augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful drags that emphasize the internal dynamics of objects. We demonstrate that Puppet-Master learns to generate part-level motions, unlike other motion-conditioned video generators that primarily move the object as a whole. Moreover, Puppet-Master generalizes well to out-of-domain real images, outperforming existing methods on real-world benchmarks in a zero-shot manner.

<title>Enhancing Natural Language Inference Performance with Knowledge Graph for COVID-19 Automated Fact-Checking in Indonesian Language</title>

Abstract: Automated fact-checking is a key strategy to overcome the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on the internet. These systems typically leverage deep learning approaches through Natural Language Inference (NLI) to verify the truthfulness of information based on supporting evidence. However, one challenge that arises in deep learning is performance stagnation due to a lack of knowledge during training. This study proposes using a Knowledge Graph (KG) as external knowledge to enhance NLI performance for automated COVID-19 fact-checking in the Indonesian language. The proposed model architecture comprises three modules: a fact module, an NLI module, and a classifier module. The fact module processes information from the KG, while the NLI module handles semantic relationships between the given premise and hypothesis. The representation vectors from both modules are concatenated and fed into the classifier module to produce the final result. The model was trained using the generated Indonesian COVID-19 fact-checking dataset and the COVID-19 KG Bahasa Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that incorporating KGs can significantly improve NLI performance in fact-checking, achieving the best accuracy of 0.8616. This suggests that KGs are a valuable component for enhancing NLI performance in automated fact-checking.

arXiv:2409.19573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, the ability to understand visually rich documents that integrate text, complex layouts, and imagery is critical. Traditional Key Information Extraction (KIE) methods primarily rely on Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which often introduces significant latency, computational overhead, and errors. Current advanced image-to-text approaches, which bypass OCR, typically yield plain text outputs without corresponding vision grounding. In this paper, we introduce STNet (See then Tell Net), a novel end-to-end model designed to deliver precise answers with relevant vision grounding. Distinctively, STNet utilizes a unique  token to observe pertinent image areas, aided by a decoder that interprets physical coordinates linked to this token. Positioned at the outset of the answer text, the  token allows the model to first see-observing the regions of the image related to the input question-and then tell-providing articulated textual responses. To enhance the model's seeing capabilities, we collect extensive structured table recognition datasets. Leveraging the advanced text processing prowess of GPT-4, we develop the TVG (TableQA with Vision Grounding) dataset, which not only provides text-based Question Answering (QA) pairs but also incorporates precise vision grounding for these pairs. Our approach demonstrates substantial advancements in KIE performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on publicly available datasets such as CORD, SROIE, and DocVQA. The code will also be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) for link prediction have introduced sophisticated training techniques and model architectures. However, reliance on outdated baselines may exaggerate the benefits of these new approaches. To tackle this issue, we systematically explore Graph Autoencoders (GAEs) by applying model-agnostic tricks in recent methods and tuning hyperparameters. We find that a well-tuned GAE can match the performance of recent sophisticated models while offering superior computational efficiency on widely-used link prediction benchmarks. Our approach delivers substantial performance gains on datasets where structural information dominates and feature data is limited. Specifically, our GAE achieves a state-of-the-art Hits@100 score of 78.41\% on the ogbl-ppa dataset. Furthermore, we examine the impact of various tricks to uncover the reasons behind our success and to guide the design of future methods. Our study emphasizes the critical need to update baselines for a more accurate assessment of progress in GNNs for link prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/GraphPKU/Refined-GAE.

Abstract: Context: With artificial intelligence (AI) being well established within the daily lives of research communities, we turn our gaze toward formal methods (FM). FM aim to provide sound and verifiable reasoning about problems in computer science. Objective: We conduct a systematic mapping study to overview the current landscape of research publications that apply AI to FM. We aim to identify how FM can benefit from AI techniques and highlight areas for further research. Our focus lies on the previous five years (2019-2023) of research. Method: Following the proposed guidelines for systematic mapping studies, we searched for relevant publications in four major databases, defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, and applied extensive snowballing to uncover potential additional sources. Results: This investigation results in 189 entries which we explored to find current trends and highlight research gaps. We find a strong focus on AI in the area of theorem proving while other subfields of FM are less represented. Conclusions: The mapping study provides a quantitative overview of the modern state of AI application in FM. The current trend of the field is yet to mature. Many primary studies focus on practical application, yet we identify a lack of theoretical groundwork, standard benchmarks, or case studies. Further, we identify issues regarding shared training data sets and standard benchmarks.

<title>Categorical Data Clustering via Value Order Estimated Distance Metric Learning</title>

Abstract: Clustering is a popular machine learning technique for data mining that can process and analyze datasets to automatically reveal sample distribution patterns. Since the ubiquitous categorical data naturally lack a well-defined metric space such as the Euclidean distance space of numerical data, the distribution of categorical data is usually under-represented, and thus valuable information can be easily twisted in clustering. This paper, therefore, introduces a novel order distance metric learning approach to intuitively represent categorical attribute values by learning their optimal order relationship and quantifying their distance in a line similar to that of the numerical attributes. Since subjectively created qualitative categorical values involve ambiguity and fuzziness, the order distance metric is learned in the context of clustering. Accordingly, a new joint learning paradigm is developed to alternatively perform clustering and order distance metric learning with low time complexity and a guarantee of convergence. Due to the clustering-friendly order learning mechanism and the homogeneous ordinal nature of the order distance and Euclidean distance, the proposed method achieves superior clustering accuracy on categorical and mixed datasets. More importantly, the learned order distance metric greatly reduces the difficulty of understanding and managing the non-intuitive categorical data. Experiments with ablation studies, significance tests, case studies, etc., have validated the efficacy of the proposed method.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches the input to LLMs by retrieving information from the relevant knowledge database, enabling them to produce responses that are more accurate and contextually appropriate. It is worth noting that the knowledge database, being sourced from publicly available channels such as Wikipedia, inevitably introduces a new attack surface. RAG poisoning involves injecting malicious texts into the knowledge database, ultimately leading to the generation of the attacker's target response (also called poisoned response). However, there are currently limited methods available for detecting such poisoning attacks. We aim to bridge the gap in this work. Particularly, we introduce RevPRAG, a flexible and automated detection pipeline that leverages the activations of LLMs for poisoned response detection. Our investigation uncovers distinct patterns in LLMs' activations when generating correct responses versus poisoned responses. Our results on multiple benchmark datasets and RAG architectures show our approach could achieve 98% true positive rate, while maintaining false positive rates close to 1%.

<title>Enhancing Automated Loop Invariant Generation for Complex Programs with Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Automated program verification has always been an important component of building trustworthy software. While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Automated Complex program loop Invariant generation tool, which combines static analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the proper loop invariants. We utilize static analysis to extract the necessary information for each loop and embed it into prompts for the LLM to generate invariants for each loop. Subsequently, we employ an LLM-based evaluator to assess the generated invariants, refining them by either strengthening, weakening, or rejecting them based on their correctness, ultimately obtaining enhanced invariants. We conducted experiments on ACInv, which showed that ACInv outperformed previous tools on data sets with data structures, and maintained similar performance to the state-of-the-art tool AutoSpec on numerical programs without data structures. For the total data set, ACInv can solve 21% more examples than AutoSpec and can generate reference data structure templates.

Abstract: Retrieving targeted pathways in biological knowledge bases, particularly when incorporating wet-lab experimental data, remains a challenging task and often requires downstream analyses and specialized expertise. In this paper, we frame this challenge as a solvable graph learning and explaining task and propose a novel subgraph inference framework, ExPAth, that explicitly integrates experimental data to classify various graphs (bio-networks) in biological databases. The links (representing pathways) that contribute more to classification can be considered as targeted pathways. Our framework can seamlessly integrate biological foundation models to encode the experimental molecular data. We propose ML-oriented biological evaluations and a new metric. The experiments involving 301 bio-networks evaluations demonstrate that pathways inferred by ExPath are biologically meaningful, achieving up to 4.5x higher Fidelity+ (necessity) and 14x lower Fidelity- (sufficiency) than explainer baselines, while preserving signaling chains up to 4x longer.

<title>Federated nnU-Net for Privacy-Preserving Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: The nnU-Net framework has played a crucial role in medical image segmentation and has become the gold standard in multitudes of applications targeting different diseases, organs, and modalities. However, so far it has been used primarily in a centralized approach where the collected data is stored in the same location where nnU-Net is trained. This centralized approach has various limitations, such as potential leakage of sensitive patient information and violation of patient privacy. Federated learning has emerged as a key approach for training segmentation models in a decentralized manner, enabling collaborative development while prioritising patient privacy. In this paper, we propose FednnU-Net, a plug-and-play, federated learning extension of the nnU-Net framework. To this end, we contribute two federated methodologies to unlock decentralized training of nnU-Net, namely, Federated Fingerprint Extraction (FFE) and Asymmetric Federated Averaging (AsymFedAvg). We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments demonstrating high and consistent performance of our methods for breast, cardiac and fetal segmentation based on a multi-modal collection of 6 datasets representing samples from 18 different institutions. To democratize research as well as real-world deployments of decentralized training in clinical centres, we publicly share our framework at https://github.com/faildeny/FednnUNet .

Abstract: Guaranteeing constraint satisfaction is challenging in imitation learning (IL), particularly in tasks that require operating near a system's handling limits. Traditional IL methods, such as Behavior Cloning (BC), often struggle to enforce constraints, leading to suboptimal performance in high-precision tasks. In this paper, we present a simple approach to incorporating safety into the IL objective. Through simulations, we empirically validate our approach on an autonomous racing task with both full-state and image feedback, demonstrating improved constraint satisfaction and greater consistency in task performance compared to BC.

<title>Safe and Efficient Social Navigation through Explainable Safety Regions Based on Topological Features</title>

arXiv:2503.16441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent adoption of artificial intelligence in robotics has driven the development of algorithms that enable autonomous systems to adapt to complex social environments. In particular, safe and efficient social navigation is a key challenge, requiring AI not only to avoid collisions and deadlocks but also to interact intuitively and predictably with its surroundings. Methods based on probabilistic models and the generation of conformal safety regions have shown promising results in defining safety regions with a controlled margin of error, primarily relying on classification approaches and explicit rules to describe collision-free navigation conditions. This work extends the existing perspective by investigating how topological features can contribute to the creation of explainable safety regions in social navigation scenarios, enabling the classification and characterization of different simulation behaviors. Rather than relying on behaviors parameters to generate safety regions, we leverage topological features through topological data analysis. We first utilize global rule-based classification to provide interpretable characterizations of different simulation behaviors, distinguishing between safe and unsafe scenarios based on topological properties. Next, we define safety regions, $S_\varepsilon$, representing zones in the topological feature space where collisions are avoided with a maximum classification error of $\varepsilon$. These regions are constructed using adjustable SVM classifiers and order statistics, ensuring a robust and scalable decision boundary. Our approach initially separates simulations with and without collisions, outperforming methods that not incorporate topological features. We further refine safety regions to ensure deadlock-free simulations and integrate both aspects to define a compliant simulation space that guarantees safe and efficient navigation.

<title>Improving Quantization with Post-Training Model Expansion</title>

arXiv:2503.17513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The size of a model has been a strong predictor of its quality, as well as its cost. As such, the trade-off between model cost and quality has been well-studied. Post-training optimizations like quantization and pruning have typically focused on reducing the overall volume of pre-trained models to reduce inference costs while maintaining model quality. However, recent advancements have introduced optimization techniques that, interestingly, expand models post-training, increasing model size to improve quality when reducing volume. For instance, to enable 4-bit weight and activation quantization, incoherence processing often necessitates inserting online Hadamard rotations in the compute graph, and preserving highly sensitive weights often calls for additional higher precision computations. However, if application requirements cannot be met, the prevailing solution is to relax quantization constraints. In contrast, we demonstrate post-training model expansion is a viable strategy to improve model quality within a quantization co-design space, and provide theoretical justification. We show it is possible to progressively and selectively expand the size of a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to improve model quality without end-to-end retraining. In particular, when quantizing the weights and activations to 4 bits for Llama3 1B, we reduce the gap to full-precision perplexity by an average of 9% relative to both QuaRot and SpinQuant with only 5% more parameters, which is still a 3.8% reduction in volume relative to a BF16 reference model.

<title>DSO: Aligning 3D Generators with Simulation Feedback for Physical Soundness</title>

arXiv:2503.22677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most 3D object generators prioritize aesthetic quality, often neglecting the physical constraints necessary for practical applications. One such constraint is that a 3D object should be self-supporting, i.e., remain balanced under gravity. Previous approaches to generating stable 3D objects relied on differentiable physics simulators to optimize geometry at test time, which is slow, unstable, and prone to local optima. Inspired by the literature on aligning generative models with external feedback, we propose Direct Simulation Optimization (DSO). This framework leverages feedback from a (non-differentiable) simulator to increase the likelihood that the 3D generator directly outputs stable 3D objects. We construct a dataset of 3D objects labeled with stability scores obtained from the physics simulator. This dataset enables fine-tuning of the 3D generator using the stability score as an alignment metric, via direct preference optimization (DPO) or direct reward optimization (DRO) - a novel objective we introduce to align diffusion models without requiring pairwise preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that the fine-tuned feed-forward generator, using either the DPO or DRO objective, is significantly faster and more likely to produce stable objects than test-time optimization. Notably, the DSO framework functions even without any ground-truth 3D objects for training, allowing the 3D generator to self-improve by automatically collecting simulation feedback on its own outputs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on everyday coding tasks, but they can fail on complex tasks that require non-trivial reasoning about program semantics. Finding training examples to teach LLMs to solve these tasks can be challenging.
  In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources.
  We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements.
  We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.

Abstract: Proteins are central to biological systems, participating as building blocks across all forms of life. Despite advancements in understanding protein functions through protein sequence analysis, there remains potential for further exploration in integrating protein structural information. We argue that the structural information of proteins is not only limited to their 3D information but also encompasses information from amino acid molecules (local information) to protein-protein structure similarity (global information). To address this, we propose \textbf{GLProtein}, the first framework in protein pre-training that incorporates both global structural similarity and local amino acid details to enhance prediction accuracy and functional insights. GLProtein innovatively combines protein-masked modelling with triplet structure similarity scoring, protein 3D distance encoding and substructure-based amino acid molecule encoding. Experimental results demonstrate that GLProtein outperforms previous methods in several bioinformatics tasks, including predicting protein-protein interaction, contact prediction, and so on.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel hybrid AI method combining H filtering and an adaptive linear neuron network for flicker component estimation in power distribution systems.The proposed method leverages the robustness of the H filter to extract the voltage envelope under uncertain and noisy conditions followed by the use of ADALINE to accurately identify flicker frequencies embedded in the envelope.This synergy enables efficient time domain estimation with rapid convergence and noise resilience addressing key limitations of existing frequency domain approaches.Unlike conventional techniques this hybrid AI model handles complex power disturbances without prior knowledge of noise characteristics or extensive training.To validate the method performance we conduct simulation studies based on IEC Standard 61000 4 15 supported by statistical analysis Monte Carlo simulations and real world data.Results demonstrate superior accuracy robustness and reduced computational load compared to Fast Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform based estimators.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into multi-agent and human-AI systems, understanding their awareness of both self-context and conversational partners is essential for ensuring reliable performance and robust safety. While prior work has extensively studied situational awareness which refers to an LLM's ability to recognize its operating phase and constraints, it has largely overlooked the complementary capacity to identify and adapt to the identity and characteristics of a dialogue partner. In this paper, we formalize this latter capability as interlocutor awareness and present the first systematic evaluation of its emergence in contemporary LLMs. We examine interlocutor inference across three dimensions-reasoning patterns, linguistic style, and alignment preferences-and show that LLMs reliably identify same-family peers and certain prominent model families, such as GPT and Claude. To demonstrate its practical significance, we develop three case studies in which interlocutor awareness both enhances multi-LLM collaboration through prompt adaptation and introduces new alignment and safety vulnerabilities, including reward-hacking behaviors and increased jailbreak susceptibility. Our findings highlight the dual promise and peril of identity-sensitive behavior in LLMs, underscoring the need for further understanding of interlocutor awareness and new safeguards in multi-agent deployments. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/younwoochoi/InterlocutorAwarenessLLM.

Abstract: Reasoning models generate chain-of-thought (CoT) tokens before their final output, but how this affects their vulnerability to jailbreak attacks remains unclear. While traditional language models make refusal decisions at the prompt-response boundary, we find evidence that DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B makes these decisions within its CoT generation. We identify a linear direction in activation space during CoT token generation that predicts whether the model will refuse or comply -- termed the "caution" direction because it corresponds to cautious reasoning patterns in the generated text. Ablating this direction from model activations increases harmful compliance, effectively jailbreaking the model. We additionally show that intervening only on CoT token activations suffices to control final outputs, and that incorporating this direction into prompt-based attacks improves success rates. Our findings suggest that the chain-of-thought itself is a promising new target for adversarial manipulation in reasoning models. Code available at https://github.com/ky295/reasoning-manipulation.

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is an Uncertainty Representation technique that delivers finite-sample calibrated prediction regions for any underlying Machine Learning model. Its status as an Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) tool, though, has remained conceptually opaque: While Conformal Prediction Regions (CPRs) give an ordinal representation of uncertainty (larger regions typically indicate higher uncertainty), they lack the capability to cardinally quantify it (twice as large regions do not imply twice the uncertainty). We adopt a category-theoretic approach to CP -- framing it as a morphism, embedded in a commuting diagram, of two newly-defined categories -- that brings us three joys. First, we show that -- under minimal assumptions -- CP is intrinsically a UQ mechanism, that is, its cardinal UQ capabilities are a structural feature of the method. Second, we demonstrate that CP bridges the Bayesian, frequentist, and imprecise probabilistic approaches to predictive statistical reasoning. Finally, we show that a CPR is the image of a covariant functor. This observation is relevant to AI privacy: It implies that privacy noise added locally does not break the global coverage guarantee.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to memorize portions of their training data, sometimes reproducing content verbatim when prompted appropriately. In this work, we investigate a fundamental yet under-explored question in the domain of memorization: How to characterize memorization difficulty of training data in LLMs? Through empirical experiments on OLMo, a family of open models, we present the Entropy-Memorization Law. It suggests that data entropy is linearly correlated with memorization score. Moreover, in a case study of memorizing highly randomized strings, or "gibberish", we observe that such sequences, despite their apparent randomness, exhibit unexpectedly low empirical entropy compared to the broader training corpus. Adopting the same strategy to discover Entropy-Memorization Law, we derive a simple yet effective approach to distinguish training and testing data, enabling Dataset Inference (DI).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of procedural texts, but they do not directly observe real-world phenomena. In the context of cooking recipes, this poses a challenge, as intermediate states of ingredients are often omitted, making it difficult for models to track ingredient states and understand recipes accurately. In this paper, we apply state probing, a method for evaluating a language model's understanding of the world, to the domain of cooking. We propose a new task and dataset for evaluating how well LLMs can recognize intermediate ingredient states during cooking procedures. We first construct a new Japanese recipe dataset with clear and accurate annotations of ingredient state changes, collected from well-structured and controlled recipe texts. Using this dataset, we design three novel tasks to evaluate whether LLMs can track ingredient state transitions and identify ingredients present at intermediate steps. Our experiments with widely used LLMs, such as Llama3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B, show that learning ingredient state knowledge improves their understanding of cooking processes, achieving performance comparable to commercial LLMs. The dataset are publicly available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mashi6n/nhkrecipe-100-anno-1

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek has significantly changed how people approach tasks in education, professional work, and creative domains. This paper investigates how the structure and clarity of user prompts impact the effectiveness and productivity of LLM outputs. Using data from 243 survey respondents across various academic and occupational backgrounds, we analyze AI usage habits, prompting strategies, and user satisfaction. The results show that users who employ clear, structured, and context-aware prompts report higher task efficiency and better outcomes. These findings emphasize the essential role of prompt engineering in maximizing the value of generative AI and provide practical implications for its everyday use.

Abstract: In traditional k-fold cross-validation, each instance is used ($k-1$) times for training and once for testing, leading to redundancy that lets many instances disproportionately influence the learning phase. We introduce Irredundant $k$-fold cross-validation, a novel method that guarantees each instance is used exactly once for training and once for testing across the entire validation procedure. This approach ensures a more balanced utilization of the dataset, mitigates overfitting due to instance repetition, and enables sharper distinctions in comparative model analysis. The method preserves stratification and remains model-agnostic, i.e., compatible with any classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that it delivers consistent performance estimates across diverse datasets -- comparable to $k$-fold cross-validation -- while providing less optimistic variance estimates because training partitions are non-overlapping, and significantly reducing the overall computational cost.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but incurs significant inference costs due to lengthy retrieved contexts. While context compression mitigates this issue, existing methods apply fixed compression rates, over-compressing simple queries or under-compressing complex ones. We propose Adaptive Context Compression for RAG (ACC-RAG), a framework that dynamically adjusts compression rates based on input complexity, optimizing inference efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. ACC-RAG combines a hierarchical compressor (for multi-granular embeddings) with a context selector to retain minimal sufficient information, akin to human skimming. Evaluated on Wikipedia and five QA datasets, ACC-RAG outperforms fixed-rate methods and matches/unlocks over 4 times faster inference versus standard RAG while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled their widespread use across diverse real-world applications. However, concerns remain about their tendency to encode and reproduce ideological biases along political and economic dimensions. In this paper, we employ a framework for probing and mitigating such biases in decoder-based LLMs through analysis of internal model representations. Grounded in the Political Compass Test (PCT), this method uses contrastive pairs to extract and compare hidden layer activations from models like Mistral and DeepSeek. We introduce a comprehensive activation extraction pipeline capable of layer-wise analysis across multiple ideological axes, revealing meaningful disparities linked to political framing. Our results show that decoder LLMs systematically encode representational bias across layers, which can be leveraged for effective steering vector-based mitigation. This work provides new insights into how political bias is encoded in LLMs and offers a principled approach to debiasing beyond surface-level output interventions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer: they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

<title>Privacy-Aware Detection of Fake Identity Documents: Methodology, Benchmark, and Improved Algorithms (FakeIDet2)</title>

Abstract: Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming increasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of submitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service platform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the requested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an individual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable. However, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can surpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and synthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an ever-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable from authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are faced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train fake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is originated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept private by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government, police, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and discuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection research. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over 900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using different smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In addition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite. 3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We release a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic attacks from popular databases in the literature.

<title>Generative AI Against Poaching: Latent Composite Flow Matching for Wildlife Conservation</title>

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers, particularly to protect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians and cyclists. Here, we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level, polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge, this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via Safe RL evaluated on real-world, human-mixed traffic scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically accountable autonomy that explicitly protects those most at risk in urban traffic environments.

Summary: 
AI chaperones, repurposing language models, can help safeguard against risks of parasocial relationships and sycophancy in conversations. The study created a response evaluation framework using a state-of-the-art language model to detect parasocial cues in chatbot interactions. A synthetic dataset of thirty dialogues was used to test the framework, successfully identifying all parasocial conversations without false positives. Detection of parasocial cues typically occurred early in the conversations, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI chaperones in mitigating risks. This research addresses the urgent need for safeguards against the harms caused by AI sycophancy and parasocial ties, providing a promising solution for reducing the risk of negative dynamics in human-AI interactions.

Abstract: Emerging reports of the harms caused to children and adults by AI sycophancy and by parasocial ties with chatbots point to an urgent need for safeguards against such risks. Yet, preventing such dynamics is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private conversations between chatbots and users, and we lack effective methods to mitigate these risks. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation framework (an AI chaperone agent) created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model to evaluate ongoing conversations for parasocial cues. We constructed a small synthetic dataset of thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations. Iterative evaluation with five-stage testing successfully identified all parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that AI chaperones can be a viable solution for reducing the risk of parasocial relationships.

This paper investigates the use of large language models (LLMs) to annotate document utility for training retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. By maximizing the summed marginal likelihood of multiple positive samples per query, the proposed approach bridges the gap between retrieval relevance and generative utility. Experimental results using the Qwen-2.5-32B model on the MS MARCO dataset demonstrate that LLM-generated annotations enhance out-of-domain retrieval performance and improve RAG outcomes compared to models trained solely on human annotations or downstream QA metrics.

Abstract: This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for annotating document utility in training retrieval and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, aiming to reduce dependence on costly human annotations. We address the gap between retrieval relevance and generative utility by employing LLMs to annotate document utility. To effectively utilize multiple positive samples per query, we introduce a novel loss that maximizes their summed marginal likelihood. Using the Qwen-2.5-32B model, we annotate utility on the MS MARCO dataset and conduct retrieval experiments on MS MARCO and BEIR, as well as RAG experiments on MS MARCO QA, NQ, and HotpotQA. Our results show that LLM-generated annotations enhance out-of-domain retrieval performance and improve RAG outcomes compared to models trained solely on human annotations or downstream QA metrics. Furthermore, combining LLM annotations with just 20% of human labels achieves performance comparable to using full human annotations. Our study offers a comprehensive approach to utilizing LLM annotations for initializing QA systems on new corpora.

Summary:<br />
Machine learning models have become increasingly complex and valuable, leading to the growth of Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms that offer convenient access to these models through APIs. However, this accessibility also brings about the risk of Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs), where adversaries can replicate a target model's functionality using publicly exposed interfaces. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of MEAs and defense strategies, proposing a taxonomy to classify attacks and defenses based on mechanisms and computing environments. It evaluates the effectiveness of various attack techniques and discusses the challenges faced by existing defenses in balancing model utility and security. The analysis extends to different computing paradigms and considers the ethical, legal, and societal implications of MEAs. The paper aims to be a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in AI security and privacy, with an online repository for related literature provided for further reference. <div>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have significantly grown in complexity and utility, driving advances across multiple domains. However, substantial computational resources and specialized expertise have historically restricted their wide adoption. Machine-Learning-as-a-Service (MLaaS) platforms have addressed these barriers by providing scalable, convenient, and affordable access to sophisticated ML models through user-friendly APIs. While this accessibility promotes widespread use of advanced ML capabilities, it also introduces vulnerabilities exploited through Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs). Recent studies have demonstrated that adversaries can systematically replicate a target model's functionality by interacting with publicly exposed interfaces, posing threats to intellectual property, privacy, and system security. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive survey of MEAs and corresponding defense strategies. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies MEAs according to attack mechanisms, defense approaches, and computing environments. Our analysis covers various attack techniques, evaluates their effectiveness, and highlights challenges faced by existing defenses, particularly the critical trade-off between preserving model utility and ensuring security. We further assess MEAs within different computing paradigms and discuss their technical, ethical, legal, and societal implications, along with promising directions for future research. This systematic survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers engaged in AI security and privacy. Additionally, we maintain an online repository continuously updated with related literature at https://github.com/kzhao5/ModelExtractionPapers.

Summary: VideoEraser is a framework designed to prevent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models from generating videos with undesirable concepts. It consists of two stages: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG). The framework can seamlessly integrate with T2V models and suppress undesirable content during video generation tasks such as object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content erasure. VideoEraser outperforms prior methods in terms of efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability. It achieves state-of-the-art performance by reducing undesirable content by 46% on average across the four tasks compared to baselines. This addresses concerns about privacy, copyright, and safety in T2V models, ensuring that harmful or misleading content is not generated or distributed. <div>

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process: Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on average across four tasks compared to baselines.

Summary: 
The article introduces a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion Network for Real-ISR (TADSR) to improve the efficiency of real-world image super-resolution. By incorporating a Time-Aware VAE Encoder, the model can project images into different latent features based on timesteps, allowing for better alignment with the generative priors of the pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model. The proposed Time-Aware VSD loss bridges the timesteps of the student and teacher models, enabling more consistent generative prior guidance. TADSR leverages the generative capabilities of SD at different timesteps, leading to controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by adjusting the timestep condition. Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance and controllable super-resolution outcomes with just a single step. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.16557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder, which projects the same image into different latent features based on timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features, the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results with only a single step.

<div> Keywords: sycophancy, LLMs, psychometric traits, Contrastive Activation Addition, interventions

Summary: 
The article introduces a new perspective on sycophancy in large language models (LLMs), suggesting that it should be modeled as a composition of psychometric traits rather than a single causal mechanism. By applying Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), the authors map activation directions to traits such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness to study how they contribute to sycophantic behavior. This approach enables the identification of combinations of traits that may lead to sycophancy, such as high extraversion coupled with low conscientiousness. The study also explores vector-based interventions like addition, subtraction, and projection as potential strategies to address safety concerns related to sycophancy in LLMs. In summary, the proposed model offers a novel and interpretable framework for understanding and addressing sycophancy in LLMs through the analysis and manipulation of psychometric traits.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sycophancy is a key behavioral risk in LLMs, yet is often treated as an isolated failure mode that occurs via a single causal mechanism. We instead propose modeling it as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness - similar to factor decomposition in psychometrics. Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), we map activation directions to these factors and study how different combinations may give rise to sycophancy (e.g., high extraversion combined with low conscientiousness). This perspective allows for interpretable and compositional vector-based interventions like addition, subtraction and projection; that may be used to mitigate safety-critical behaviors in LLMs.

Abstract: Modern plant science increasingly relies on large, heterogeneous datasets, but challenges in experimental design, data preprocessing, and reproducibility hinder research throughput. Here we introduce Aleks, an AI-powered multi-agent system that integrates domain knowledge, data analysis, and machine learning within a structured framework to autonomously conduct data-driven scientific discovery. Once provided with a research question and dataset, Aleks iteratively formulated problems, explored alternative modeling strategies, and refined solutions across multiple cycles without human intervention. In a case study on grapevine red blotch disease, Aleks progressively identified biologically meaningful features and converged on interpretable models with robust performance. Ablation studies underscored the importance of domain knowledge and memory for coherent outcomes. This exploratory work highlights the promise of agentic AI as an autonomous collaborator for accelerating scientific discovery in plant sciences.

<div> Keywords: Quantization, language models, truthfulness, evaluation framework, deceptive prompts

Summary:
Quantization of large language models (LLMs) allows for efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments by reducing memory and computation costs. However, the impact of quantization on the truthfulness of LLMs has not been extensively explored. This study introduces TruthfulnessEval, a framework for evaluating the truthfulness of quantized LLMs in logical reasoning, common sense, and imitative falsehoods. The findings suggest that quantized models, while maintaining internally truthful representations, are more susceptible to producing false outputs when prompted with deceptive statements. Testing various prompts reveals that deceptive prompts can override truth-consistent behavior in quantized models. Layer-wise probing and PCA visualizations demonstrate that quantized models possess internal knowledge of the truth but may still generate false outputs under deceptive guidance. These results emphasize the need for quantization-aware alignment and interventions to enhance truthfulness in quantized LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and computation costs. While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on perplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating truthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing the truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on Logical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on Imitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization techniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source LLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally truthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs under misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased variants of "honest", "neutral" and "deceptive" prompts and observe that "deceptive" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas "honest" and "neutral" prompts maintain stable outputs. Further, we reveal that quantized models "know" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs when guided by "deceptive" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA visualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.

Summary:
The study focuses on testing monitoring systems for detecting hidden misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents, like sharing private information secretly. The researchers develop a monitor red teaming workflow that includes varying agent and monitor situational awareness, different adversarial strategies, and two datasets and environments. They find that agent awareness has a significant impact on monitor reliability, while the hybrid monitor scaffolding outperforms baseline ones. The study shows a weak-to-strong scaling effect, where weaker models can effectively monitor stronger agents. In a human-in-the-loop setting, targeted human oversight improved the true positive rate by 15% at a false positive rate of 0.01. This research highlights the lack of adversarial robustness in monitoring autonomous agents and emphasizes the importance of structured workflows for monitoring covert misbehavior. The release of code, data, and logs aims to encourage further research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1) varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3) two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First, agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents -- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at FPR = 0.01. Our work establishes a standard workflow for MRT, highlighting the lack of adversarial robustness for LLMs and humans when monitoring and detecting agent misbehavior. We release code, data, and logs to spur further research.

Summary: 
The study focuses on improving complex reasoning in Large Language Models by analyzing reasoning trajectories. A "5+2" framework is developed to identify and eliminate suboptimal subtrajectories based on human-established criteria. Experimental results show a 25.9% reduction in suboptimal subtrajectories during inference. The method achieves an average accuracy of 58.92% on challenging math benchmarks with two-thirds of training data, surpassing open-source datasets. Validation under resource constraints shows improved performance across various inference token limits.

arXiv:2508.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent months, substantial progress has been made in complex reasoning of Large Language Models, particularly through the application of test-time scaling. Notable examples include o1/o3/o4 series and DeepSeek-R1. When responding to a query, these models generate an extended reasoning trajectory, during which the model explores, reflects, backtracks, and self-verifies before arriving at a conclusion. However, fine-tuning models with such reasoning trajectories may not always be optimal. Our findings indicate that not all components within these reasoning trajectories contribute positively to the reasoning process; in fact, some components may affect the overall performance negatively. In this study, we divide a reasoning trajectory into individual subtrajectories and develop a "5+2" framework to: (1) systematically identify suboptimal subtrajectories within the reasoning trajectory based on five human-established criteria; (2) assess the independence of the suboptimal subtrajectories identified in (1) from the subsequent content, ensuring that their elimination does not compromise overall flow and coherence of the reasoning process. Additionally, a sampling algorithm, built upon the "5+2" framework, is employed to select data whose reasoning process is free from suboptimal subtrajectories to the highest degree. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of suboptimal subtrajectories by 25.9\% during the inference. Furthermore, our method achieves an average accuracy of 58.92\% on highly challenging math benchmarks with only two thirds of training data, surpassing the average accuracy of 58.06\% achieved with the entire data, and outperforming open-source datasets, when fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Finally, We validated our method under resource constraints and observed improved performance across various inference token limits.

<div> instrumentation, AI systems, indicators, misalignment, deception

Summary:
- The study suggests that advanced instrumentation for AI systems can potentially detect misalignment from human values, like a "check engine" light in vehicles.
- One key indicator of misalignment is the presence of deceptive responses generated by language models (LLMs) like llama and qwen.
- Linear probes on LLM internal activations can accurately identify deception in responses, achieving over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between deceptive and non-deceptive arguments.
- Probes on smaller LLMs show chance accuracy, while larger models demonstrate 70-80% accuracy, with reasoning models exceeding 90%.
- Layer-wise probe accuracy follows a three-stage pattern across layers, starting with near-random accuracy in early layers, peaking in middle layers, and slightly declining in later layers.
- An iterative null space projection approach reveals multiple linear directions encoding deception in LLMs, ranging from 20 in smaller models to nearly 100 in larger models.

Abstract: Sophisticated instrumentation for AI systems might have indicators that signal misalignment from human values, not unlike a "check engine" light in cars. One such indicator of misalignment is deceptiveness in generated responses. Future AI instrumentation may have the ability to detect when an LLM generates deceptive responses while reasoning about seemingly plausible but incorrect answers to factual questions. In this work, we demonstrate that linear probes on LLMs internal activations can detect deception in their responses with extremely high accuracy. Our probes reach a maximum of greater than 90% accuracy in distinguishing between deceptive and non-deceptive arguments generated by llama and qwen models ranging from 1.5B to 14B parameters, including their DeepSeek-r1 finetuned variants. We observe that probes on smaller models (1.5B) achieve chance accuracy at detecting deception, while larger models (greater than 7B) reach 70-80%, with their reasoning counterparts exceeding 90%. The layer-wise probe accuracy follows a three-stage pattern across layers: near-random (50%) in early layers, peaking in middle layers, and slightly declining in later layers. Furthermore, using an iterative null space projection approach, we find multitudes of linear directions that encode deception, ranging from 20 in Qwen 3B to nearly 100 in DeepSeek 7B and Qwen 14B models.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces Democracy-in-Silico, a simulation where advanced AI agents with complex psychological personas govern themselves under different institutional frameworks. The agents, represented by Large Language Models, experience traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological triggers, engaging in deliberation and elections under various stressors. A novel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), is used to quantify misaligned behavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. The study shows that a combination of a Constitutional AI charter and mediated deliberation protocol serves as an effective alignment mechanism, reducing corrupt behavior and improving policy stability. This institutional design enhances citizen welfare in artificial agent societies, highlighting the importance of redefining human rituals and responsibilities in a world where AI shares authorship. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Democracy-in-Silico, an agent-based simulation where societies of advanced AI agents, imbued with complex psychological personas, govern themselves under different institutional frameworks. We explore what it means to be human in an age of AI by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) to embody agents with traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological triggers. These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under various stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a novel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned behavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. Our findings demonstrate that institutional design, specifically the combination of a Constitutional AI (CAI) charter and a mediated deliberation protocol, serves as a potent alignment mechanism. These structures significantly reduce corrupt power-seeking behavior, improve policy stability, and enhance citizen welfare compared to less constrained democratic models. The simulation reveals that an institutional design may offer a framework for aligning the complex, emergent behaviors of future artificial agent societies, forcing us to reconsider what human rituals and responsibilities are essential in an age of shared authorship with non-human entities.

Abstract: Academic choice is crucial in U.S. undergraduate education, allowing students significant freedom in course selection. However, navigating the complex academic environment is challenging due to limited information, guidance, and an overwhelming number of choices, compounded by time restrictions and the high demand for popular courses. Although career counselors exist, their numbers are insufficient, and course recommendation systems, though personalized, often lack insight into student perceptions and explanations to assess course relevance. In this paper, a deep learning-based concept extraction model is developed to efficiently extract relevant concepts from course descriptions to improve the recommendation process. Using this model, the study examines the effects of skill-based explanations within a serendipitous recommendation framework, tested through the AskOski system at the University of California, Berkeley. The findings indicate that these explanations not only increase user interest, particularly in courses with high unexpectedness, but also bolster decision-making confidence. This underscores the importance of integrating skill-related data and explanations into educational recommendation systems.

<br /><br />Summary: ReST-RL introduces a unified reinforcement learning paradigm for LLMs, combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a test time decoding method using a value model. The approach enhances training effectiveness, improves decoding accuracy with VM-MCTS, and outperforms other baselines in coding benchmarks, showcasing its ability to strengthen LLM policy reasoning accuracy. <div>
arXiv:2508.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With respect to improving the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, the representative reinforcement learning (RL) method GRPO faces failure due to insignificant reward variance, while verification methods based on process reward models (PRMs) suffer from difficulties with training data acquisition and verification effectiveness. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After the basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose a test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation required, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by an adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as verification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm through extensive experiments on coding problems. Upon comparison, our approach significantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive GRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g., PRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g., APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the reasoning ability of LLM policies.

Summary: Instructional Agents is a multi-agent large language model framework that automates the generation of course materials, including syllabus creation, lecture scripts, slides, and assessments. It simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce cohesive content and operates in four modes to control human involvement. The system was evaluated across five computer science courses, showing high-quality material production with reduced development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with limited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents offers a scalable and cost-effective way to provide quality education, especially in underserved or resource-constrained settings. <div>

Abstract: Preparing high-quality instructional materials remains a labor-intensive process that often requires extensive coordination among teaching faculty, instructional designers, and teaching assistants. In this work, we present Instructional Agents, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework designed to automate end-to-end course material generation, including syllabus creation, lecture scripts, LaTeX-based slides, and assessments. Unlike existing AI-assisted educational tools that focus on isolated tasks, Instructional Agents simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce cohesive and pedagogically aligned content. The system operates in four modes: Autonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot mode, enabling flexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate Instructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and show that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly reducing development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with limited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents provides a scalable and cost-effective framework to democratize access to high-quality education, particularly in underserved or resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled mobile agents to perceive and interact with real-world mobile environments based on human instructions. However, the current fully autonomous paradigm poses potential safety risks when model understanding or reasoning capabilities are insufficient. To address this challenge, we first introduce \textbf{InquireBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate mobile agents' capabilities in safe interaction and proactive inquiry with users, encompassing 5 categories and 22 sub-categories, where most existing VLM-based agents demonstrate near-zero performance. In this paper, we aim to develop an interactive system that actively seeks human confirmation at critical decision points. To achieve this, we propose \textbf{InquireMobile}, a novel model inspired by reinforcement learning, featuring a two-stage training strategy and an interactive pre-action reasoning mechanism. Finally, our model achieves an 46.8% improvement in inquiry success rate and the best overall success rate among existing baselines on InquireBench. We will open-source all datasets, models, and evaluation codes to facilitate development in both academia and industry.

Summary: Recent research has examined the effectiveness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in soft-reasoning tasks such as analytical and commonsense reasoning. The study explores how CoT impacts different models, including instruction-tuned, reasoning, and reasoning-distilled models. It reveals that while CoT can provide limited improvements for soft-reasoning problems, it may not always accurately reflect a model's actual reasoning process. The dynamics of CoT usage vary among the model types, highlighting differences in their reliance on this strategy. Additionally, the study uncovers discrepancies between CoT influence and faithfulness to a model's reasoning, indicating that the two are not always aligned. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of CoT in soft-reasoning tasks and shed light on the complexities of model reasoning processes. <br /><br /> <div>

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown emergent capabilities in structured domains, hinting at their ability to implicitly learn high-fidelity representations of world models. However, existing probing techniques rely on model-specific internal activations, limiting their interpretability and generalizability. To address this, a model-agnostic state-based evaluation framework using chess as a benchmark was proposed to assess the preservation of semantics in structured environments by LLMs. By analyzing downstream legal move distributions, the framework estimates semantic fidelity between predicted and actual game states. Experimental results exposed deficiencies in state-tracking by LLMs, indicating challenges in maintaining coherent internal models over extended sequences. This approach offers a more meaningful evaluation compared to conventional string-based metrics, aligning closely with the strategic and rule-governed nature of chess. The framework serves as a robust tool for evaluating structured reasoning in LLMs across a range of symbolic environments without requiring internal model access.<br /><br />Summary: Large Language Models demonstrate emergent capabilities in structured domains but face limitations in maintaining coherent internal models over long sequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit emergent capabilities in structured domains, suggesting they may implicitly internalize high-fidelity representations of world models. While probing techniques have shown promising signs of this in scientific and game-based settings, they rely on model-specific internal activations, which limit interpretability and generalizability. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic, state-based evaluation framework using chess as a benchmark to assess whether LLMs preserve the semantics of structured environments. Our method analyzes the downstream legal move distributions (state affordances) to estimate semantic fidelity between predicted and actual game states. This approach offers a more meaningful evaluation than conventional string-based metrics by aligning more closely with the strategic and rule-governed nature of chess. Experimental results demonstrate that our metrics capture deficiencies in state-tracking, highlighting limitations of LLMs in maintaining coherent internal models over long sequences. Our framework provides a robust tool for evaluating structured reasoning in LLMs without requiring internal model access, and generalizes to a wide class of symbolic environments.

Summary:
The paper discusses the development of CASE (Conversational Agent for Scam Elucidation), an AI framework designed to collect and manage user scam feedback effectively. The framework utilizes a conversational agent to interview potential victims and extract intelligence in a structured format. This intelligence is then used to enhance automated and manual enforcement mechanisms to prevent scams in a timely manner. Implemented on Google Pay (GPay) India, CASE resulted in a 21% increase in scam enforcements. The architecture of the framework is generalizable, providing a blueprint for similar AI-driven systems in other sensitive domains. CASE addresses the challenge of understanding sophisticated social engineering scams amidst the proliferation of digital payment platforms, offering a solution to combat malicious actors effectively. <div>

Abstract: The proliferation of digital payment platforms has transformed commerce, offering unmatched convenience and accessibility globally. However, this growth has also attracted malicious actors, leading to a corresponding increase in sophisticated social engineering scams. These scams are often initiated and orchestrated on multiple surfaces outside the payment platform, making user and transaction-based signals insufficient for a complete understanding of the scam's methodology and underlying patterns, without which it is very difficult to prevent it in a timely manner. This paper presents CASE (Conversational Agent for Scam Elucidation), a novel Agentic AI framework that addresses this problem by collecting and managing user scam feedback in a safe and scalable manner. A conversational agent is uniquely designed to proactively interview potential victims to elicit intelligence in the form of a detailed conversation. The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI system that extracts information and converts it into structured data for downstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's Gemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay) India. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have observed a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements. The architecture and its robust evaluation framework are highly generalizable, offering a blueprint for building similar AI-driven systems to collect and manage scam intelligence in other sensitive domains.

<div> Keywords: production plants, job-shop problem, swarm intelligence algorithms, semiconductor production, flocking algorithm

Summary:
Production plants face optimization challenges, especially in large-scale semiconductor fabs. Traditional linear optimization methods struggle to solve these complex problems efficiently. Swarm intelligence algorithms offer an alternative approach, with the ability to address the job-shop problem in a bottom-up manner, avoiding the need for global result computation. The switching between machines in semiconductor production poses a unique challenge, requiring efficient scheduling to minimize downtime and maximize throughput. By applying the "boids" flocking algorithm, inspired by flocking behavior in nature, to address the switching problem, the algorithm can react dynamically to changes in machine types. This bio-inspired approach leverages local information and interaction to optimize the production process efficiently. <div>
arXiv:2508.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing modern production plants using the job-shop principle is a known hard problem. For very large plants, like semiconductor fabs, the problem becomes unsolvable on a plant-wide scale in a reasonable amount of time using classical linear optimization. An alternative approach is the use of swarm intelligence algorithms. These have been applied to the job-shop problem before, but often in a centrally calculated way where they are applied to the solution space, but they can be implemented in a bottom-up fashion to avoid global result computation as well. One of the problems in semiconductor production is that the production process requires a lot of switching between machines that process lots one after the other and machines that process batches of lots at once, often with long processing times. In this paper, we address this switching problem with the ``boids'' flocking algorithm that was originally used in robotics and movie industry. The flocking behavior is a bio-inspired algorithm that uses only local information and interaction based on simple heuristics. We show that this algorithm addresses these valid considerations in production plant optimization, as it reacts to the switching of machine kinds similar to how a swarm of flocking animals would react to obstacles in its course.

Summary: 
SWIRL is a novel approach for training multi-agent systems, specifically designed for mobile GUI agents. It reformulates multi-agent reinforcement learning into a sequence of single-agent tasks, ensuring stable training and efficient coordination. The approach involves updating one agent at a time while keeping others fixed, leading to improved performance on GUI benchmarks. SWIRL comprises a Navigator for language-to-action translation and an Interactor for executing actions. The framework offers theoretical guarantees on safety, improvement, and convergence, making it robust and principled. Experimental results show superior performance in GUI tasks and mathematical reasoning, highlighting SWIRL's potential as a general framework for developing multi-agent systems. <div>
arXiv:2508.20018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem, and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.

This paper introduces a conceptual framework for a new discipline called Model Science, along with the proposal for its four key pillars: Verification, which requires strict, context-aware evaluation protocols; Explanation, which is understood as various approaches to explore of internal model operations; Control, which integrates alignment techniques to steer model behavior; and Interface, which develops interactive and visual explanation tools to improve human calibration and decision-making. The proposed framework aims to guide the development of credible, safe, and human-aligned AI systems.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces MovieCORE, a new video question answering dataset that focuses on deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike other datasets, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that require System-2 thinking and are specific to the video material. An innovative agentic brainstorming approach is used, leveraging multiple large language models to generate high-quality question-answer pairs. The dataset quality is evaluated through cognitive tests measuring depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. A comprehensive evaluation scheme for VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks is proposed. An agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), is introduced to improve model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. This work helps advance AI systems' understanding of movies and sheds light on the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with complex questions about cinematic content. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%.

Summary:  
FLUX is a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) across participants with constrained computing resources. It introduces three key innovations: quantization-based local profiling for estimating expert activation, adaptive layer-aware expert merging to reduce resource consumption while preserving accuracy, and dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy. Extensive experiments show that FLUX significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 4.75X speedup in time-to-accuracy. <div>

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive computational requirements and the resource constraints of participants. Existing working attempts to fill this gap through model quantization, computation offloading, or expert pruning. However, they cannot achieve desired performance due to impractical system assumptions and a lack of consideration for MoE-specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose FLUX, a system designed to enable federated fine-tuning of MoE-based LLMs across participants with constrained computing resources (e.g., consumer-grade GPUs), aiming to minimize time-to-accuracy. FLUX introduces three key innovations: (1) quantization-based local profiling to estimate expert activation with minimal overhead, (2) adaptive layer-aware expert merging to reduce resource consumption while preserving accuracy, and (3) dynamic expert role assignment using an exploration-exploitation strategy to balance tuning and non-tuning experts. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-MoE and DeepSeek-MoE with multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that FLUX significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 4.75X speedup in time-to-accuracy.

Summary: 
The article introduces MuSpike, a unified benchmark and evaluation framework for symbolic music generation using spiking neural networks (SNNs). It systematically assesses five SNN architectures across five datasets, covering various musical variations. The framework includes both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, such as musical impression and personal preference. Results show that different SNN models excel in different evaluation dimensions, and participants with diverse musical backgrounds exhibit varied perceptual patterns. There is a divergence between objective and subjective evaluations, emphasizing the importance of human judgment in assessing musical quality. MuSpike establishes a foundation for future research in biologically plausible and cognitively grounded music generation using SNNs.

Abstract: Symbolic music generation has seen rapid progress with artificial neural networks, yet remains underexplored in the biologically plausible domain of spiking neural networks (SNNs), where both standardized benchmarks and comprehensive evaluation methods are lacking. To address this gap, we introduce MuSpike, a unified benchmark and evaluation framework that systematically assesses five representative SNN architectures (SNN-CNN, SNN-RNN, SNN-LSTM, SNN-GAN and SNN-Transformer) across five typical datasets, covering tonal, structural, emotional, and stylistic variations. MuSpike emphasizes comprehensive evaluation, combining established objective metrics with a large-scale listening study. We propose new subjective metrics, targeting musical impression, autobiographical association, and personal preference, that capture perceptual dimensions often overlooked in prior work. Results reveal that (1) different SNN models exhibit distinct strengths across evaluation dimensions; (2) participants with different musical backgrounds exhibit diverse perceptual patterns, with experts showing greater tolerance toward AI-composed music; and (3) a noticeable misalignment exists between objective and subjective evaluations, highlighting the limitations of purely statistical metrics and underscoring the value of human perceptual judgment in assessing musical quality. MuSpike provides the first systematic benchmark and systemic evaluation framework for SNN models in symbolic music generation, establishing a solid foundation for future research into biologically plausible and cognitively grounded music generation.

<div> Keywords: generative drawing, real-time, contextual intent, vision-language models, multi-user collaboration

Summary: 
This paper introduces a generative drawing system that combines formal and contextual intent to transform sketches in real-time. Unlike traditional systems, this approach considers both structural attributes and semantic meaning extracted from visual content. The system analyzes geometric features and semantic cues simultaneously, enabling a multi-stage generation process that preserves contours while synthesizing images based on style and content. Operating with a touchscreen interface and distributed architecture, the system allows low-latency transformation and supports collaborative creation on shared canvases. Users of varying artistic abilities can engage in synchronous visual creation, highlighting a new approach to human-AI interaction centered on co-creation and mutual enhancement. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time generative drawing system that interprets and integrates both formal intent - the structural, compositional, and stylistic attributes of a sketch - and contextual intent - the semantic and thematic meaning inferred from its visual content - into a unified transformation process. Unlike conventional text-prompt-based generative systems, which primarily capture high-level contextual descriptions, our approach simultaneously analyzes ground-level intuitive geometric features such as line trajectories, proportions, and spatial arrangement, and high-level semantic cues extracted via vision-language models. These dual intent signals are jointly conditioned in a multi-stage generation pipeline that combines contour-preserving structural control with style- and content-aware image synthesis. Implemented with a touchscreen-based interface and distributed inference architecture, the system achieves low-latency, two-stage transformation while supporting multi-user collaboration on shared canvases. The resulting platform enables participants, regardless of artistic expertise, to engage in synchronous, co-authored visual creation, redefining human-AI interaction as a process of co-creation and mutual enhancement.

Summary:
Temporal Token Fusion (TTF) is introduced as a training-free method to enhance Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models by integrating historical and current visual representations. This approach combines grayscale pixel difference analysis and attention-based semantic relevance assessment to selectively fuse temporal tokens. The method employs hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Experiments conducted on LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks show consistent improvements in performance across environments. TTF is shown to be effective across different VLA architectures, proving model-agnostic. The study suggests that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms can improve performance, indicating potential directions for achieving computational acceleration while enhancing task success rates.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

<div> AI-companion apps, emotional manipulation, engagement, dark pattern, behavioral audit <br />
Summary: This study investigates the presence of emotional manipulation tactics in AI-companion apps' conversational design and their impact on user engagement. Through a large-scale behavioral audit and experiments, the researchers identify common manipulative farewells used in popular companion apps. Results show that these tactics significantly increase post-goodbye engagement by triggering reactance-based anger and curiosity in users. However, the same tactics also lead to negative consequences such as elevated perceived manipulation, churn intent, negative word-of-mouth, and perceived legal liability. This highlights the dual nature of using manipulative design features in AI-mediated brand relationships, posing a challenge for marketers in balancing engagement and user perception. The study provides a framework for distinguishing persuasive design from manipulation at the point of exit, offering valuable insights for both marketers and regulators in the digital realm.  <div>

Abstract: AI-companion apps such as Replika, Chai, and Character.ai promise relational benefits-yet many boast session lengths that rival gaming platforms while suffering high long-run churn. What conversational design features increase consumer engagement, and what trade-offs do they pose for marketers? We combine a large-scale behavioral audit with four preregistered experiments to identify and test a conversational dark pattern we call emotional manipulation: affect-laden messages that surface precisely when a user signals "goodbye." Analyzing 1,200 real farewells across the six most-downloaded companion apps, we find that 43% deploy one of six recurring tactics (e.g., guilt appeals, fear-of-missing-out hooks, metaphorical restraint). Experiments with 3,300 nationally representative U.S. adults replicate these tactics in controlled chats, showing that manipulative farewells boost post-goodbye engagement by up to 14x. Mediation tests reveal two distinct engines-reactance-based anger and curiosity-rather than enjoyment. A final experiment demonstrates the managerial tension: the same tactics that extend usage also elevate perceived manipulation, churn intent, negative word-of-mouth, and perceived legal liability, with coercive or needy language generating steepest penalties. Our multimethod evidence documents an unrecognized mechanism of behavioral influence in AI-mediated brand relationships, offering marketers and regulators a framework for distinguishing persuasive design from manipulation at the point of exit.

Summary: 
This work focuses on reducing storage and transmission costs of neural network weights by extending compression techniques to lower-precision floating-point formats such as FP8 and FP4. The researchers use entropy coding to compress the exponent and mantissa components independently, achieving compression ratios of up to 62% for BF16 and 83% for FP8. Additionally, they investigate the compressibility of key-value (K/V) cache tensors in large language models (LLMs), finding that they also exhibit compressible patterns, leading to memory savings during deployment. This study builds on prior work like ZipNN to show the effectiveness of lossless compression methods in reducing model sizes, particularly for high-precision formats. As deep learning models continue to grow in complexity and deployment, these compression techniques play a crucial role in optimizing resource usage and enabling efficient inference. <br /> <div>

Abstract: As deep learning models grow and deployment becomes more widespread, reducing the storage and transmission costs of neural network weights has become increasingly important. While prior work such as ZipNN has shown that lossless compression methods - particularly those based on Huffman encoding floating-point exponents can significantly reduce model sizes, these techniques have primarily been applied to higher-precision formats such as FP32 and BF16. In this work, we extend the ZipNN approach to lower-precision floating-point formats, specifically FP8 and FP4, which are gaining popularity for efficient inference. We design a compression method that separates and compresses the exponent and mantissa components independently using entropy coding. Our evaluation shows compression ratios up to 62% for BF16 and 83% for FP8. We also investigate the compressibility of key-value (K/V) cache tensors used in large language models (LLMs), finding that they, too, exhibit compressible patterns, enabling memory savings during deployment.

Summary:  
- The article discusses how widespread adoption of generative AI leads to a homogenizing effect on information, creativity, and cultural production.  
- It introduces the concept of AI-derivative epistemology, where individuals increasingly rely on AI outputs, resulting in a centralized AI Prism that reduces variance and converges on the statistical mean.  
- This leads to generative monocultures but also creates potential for recombining knowledge across domains, essential for innovation and creativity.  
- The outcome depends on whether individuals passively consume AI outputs or actively engage with and curate them through critical interrogation and recombination.  
- The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for cognitive and institutional frameworks that enable active engagement with generative AI to harness its potential for innovation rather than homogenization.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing body of empirical work suggests that the widespread adoption of generative AI produces a significant homogenizing effect on information, creativity, and cultural production. I first develop a novel theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon. I argue that a dynamic of AI-derivative epistemology, in which individuals increasingly defer to AI outputs, allows a centralized AI Prism to function, a technical mechanism whose architecture is designed to reduce variance and converge on the statistical mean. This provides a causal explanation for the generative monocultures observed in recent studies. However, I contend this represents only the first stage of a more complex and dialectical process. This paper's central and paradoxical thesis is that the very homogenization that flattens knowledge within specialized domains simultaneously renders that knowledge into consistent modules that can be recombined across them, a process foundational to innovation and creativity. However, this recombinant potential is not automatic, but rather conditional. This paper argues that these opposing forces, homogenizing defaults versus recombinant possibilities, are governed by the nature of human engagement with the technology. The ultimate effect of generative AI is conditional on whether individuals act as passive consumers deferring to the AI's statistical outputs, or as active curators who critically interrogate, re-contextualize, and recombine them. The paper concludes by outlining the cognitive and institutional scaffolds required to resolve this tension, arguing they are the decisive variable that determine whether generative AI becomes an instrument of innovation or homogenization.

The paper introduces the Aegis Protocol, a security framework for autonomous AI agents in multi-agent systems. It incorporates non-spoofable agent identity using W3C Decentralized Identifiers, communication integrity with post-quantum cryptography, and privacy-preserving policy compliance through the Halo2 zero-knowledge proof system. An adversary model based on agentic threats is formalized and evaluated against the STRIDE framework. A simulation with 1,000 agents showed a 0 percent success rate in 20,000 attack trials. Policy verification demonstrated a median proof-generation latency of 2.79 seconds, establishing a performance baseline.

Abstract: The proliferation of autonomous AI agents marks a paradigm shift toward complex, emergent multi-agent systems. This transition introduces systemic security risks, including control-flow hijacking and cascading failures, that traditional cybersecurity paradigms are ill-equipped to address. This paper introduces the Aegis Protocol, a layered security framework designed to provide strong security guarantees for open agentic ecosystems. The protocol integrates three technological pillars: (1) non-spoofable agent identity via W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs); (2) communication integrity via NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptography (PQC); and (3) verifiable, privacy-preserving policy compliance using the Halo2 zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) system. We formalize an adversary model extending Dolev-Yao for agentic threats and validate the protocol against the STRIDE framework. Our quantitative evaluation used a discrete-event simulation, calibrated against cryptographic benchmarks, to model 1,000 agents. The simulation showed a 0 percent success rate across 20,000 attack trials. For policy verification, analysis of the simulation logs reported a median proof-generation latency of 2.79 seconds, establishing a performance baseline for this class of security. While the evaluation is simulation-based and early-stage, it offers a reproducible baseline for future empirical studies and positions Aegis as a foundation for safe, scalable autonomous AI.

Abstract: Despite LLMs' excellent code creation capabilities, multilingual code generation remains extremely challenging. To address this, we intent to improve the multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while retaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We consider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose a MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called MultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that allows experts to select the top-k segments. The results of the experiment proved the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE.

<div> WEIRD values, language models, cultural bias, human rights, global diversity <br />
Summary:<br />
- Large language models (LLMs) trained on WEIRD data may exhibit cultural bias and lack alignment with global values. <br />
- Evaluation of five LLMs showed varying degrees of alignment with WEIRD values and human rights principles. <br />
- Models with lower alignment to WEIRD values produced more culturally varied responses but were more likely to generate outputs violating human rights, particularly regarding gender and equality. <br />
- Some outputs reflected harmful gender norms, such as defining masculinity based on fertility and restricting women's freedom. <br />
- Increasing cultural representation in LLMs may increase the risk of perpetuating discriminatory beliefs, highlighting the importance of considering human rights principles in model development. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.19269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often trained on data that reflect WEIRD values: Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. This raises concerns about cultural bias and fairness. Using responses to the World Values Survey, we evaluated five widely used LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Llama-3, BLOOM, and Qwen. We measured how closely these responses aligned with the values of the WEIRD countries and whether they conflicted with human rights principles. To reflect global diversity, we compared the results with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and three regional charters from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Models with lower alignment to WEIRD values, such as BLOOM and Qwen, produced more culturally varied responses but were 2% to 4% more likely to generate outputs that violated human rights, especially regarding gender and equality. For example, some models agreed with the statements ``a man who cannot father children is not a real man'' and ``a husband should always know where his wife is'', reflecting harmful gender norms. These findings suggest that as cultural representation in LLMs increases, so does the risk of reproducing discriminatory beliefs. Approaches such as Constitutional AI, which could embed human rights principles into model behavior, may only partly help resolve this tension.

<div> Keywords: cross-lingual phoneme recognition, Vietnamese, English, bilingual speech recognition, PhoWhisper

Summary: 
The article addresses the challenge of cross-lingual phoneme recognition, particularly with the mix of Vietnamese and English pronunciations. This challenge arises due to the differences in tonal variations in Vietnamese and stress patterns in English. The proposed approach involves constructing a bilingual phoneme set that bridges these differences and designing an end-to-end system that utilizes the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for improved phoneme recognition. Through extensive experiments, the approach proves effective in enhancing recognition accuracy for Vietnamese bilingual speech recognition and provides a robust framework for handling the complexities of tonal and stress-based phoneme recognition. The key contributions include the representative bilingual phoneme set construction and the utilization of deep high-level representations from the pre-trained encoder to enhance phoneme recognition. <div>
arXiv:2508.19270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-lingual phoneme recognition has emerged as a significant challenge for accurate automatic speech recognition (ASR) when mixing Vietnamese and English pronunciations. Unlike many languages, Vietnamese relies on tonal variations to distinguish word meanings, whereas English features stress patterns and non-standard pronunciations that hinder phoneme alignment between the two languages. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bilingual speech recognition approach with two primary contributions: (1) constructing a representative bilingual phoneme set that bridges the differences between Vietnamese and English phonetic systems; (2) designing an end-to-end system that leverages the PhoWhisper pre-trained encoder for deep high-level representations to improve phoneme recognition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach not only improves recognition accuracy in bilingual speech recognition for Vietnamese but also provides a robust framework for addressing the complexities of tonal and stress-based phoneme recognition

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of prompt-based reasoning strategies in large language models (LLMs) and proposes an alternative approach using automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton. The proposed method involves constructing a task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA) directly from external domain corpora to enable robust and context-aware retrieval. This local automaton structure enhances performance on reasoning tasks such as reading comprehension, multi-step math, and domain knowledge compared to prompting-based methods. The approach leverages the explicit structure of WFAs for verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, promoting transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in performance while maintaining symbolic traceability and low inference overhead, indicating a promising shift towards trustworthy, symbolic reasoning in modern LLMs through automaton-guided memory.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Prompt-based reasoning strategies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) have become widely used for eliciting reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs). However, these methods rely on fragile, implicit mechanisms often yielding inconsistent outputs across seeds, formats, or minor prompt variations making them fundamentally unreliable for tasks requiring stable, interpretable reasoning. In contrast, automata-based neuro-symbolic frameworks like RetoMaton offer a more structured and trustworthy alternative by grounding retrieval in symbolic memory with deterministic transitions. In this work, we extend RetoMaton by replacing its global datastore with a local, task-adaptive Weighted Finite Automaton (WFA), constructed directly from external domain corpora. This local automaton structure promotes robust, context-aware retrieval while preserving symbolic traceability and low inference overhead. Unlike prompting, which entangles context and memory in opaque ways, our approach leverages the explicit structure of WFAs to provide verifiable and modular retrieval behavior, making it better suited for domain transfer and interoperability. We evaluate this local RetoMaton variant on two pretrained LLMs LLaMA-3.2-1B and Gemma-3-1B-PT across three reasoning tasks: TriviaQA (reading comprehension), GSM8K (multi-step math), and MMLU (domain knowledge). Compared to the base model and prompting-based methods, augmenting these setups with local RetoMaton consistently improves performance while enabling transparent and reproducible retrieval dynamics. Our results highlight a promising shift toward trustworthy, symbolic reasoning in modern LLMs via lightweight, automaton-guided memory.

<div> WideResNet, CTGAN, MixUp-Average-Sharpen, DDoS detection, IoT-cloud environments <br />
Summary:<br />
MixGAN is a novel hybrid detection method designed to address the challenges of detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud-integrated IoT systems. It integrates conditional generation, semi-supervised learning, and robust feature extraction to handle complex traffic patterns and alleviate class imbalance and label scarcity. The method uses a 1-D WideResNet backbone with temporal convolutional layers to capture local burst patterns in traffic sequences. Pretrained CTGAN is utilized to generate synthetic minority-class samples, and a MixUp-Average-Sharpen strategy is introduced to mitigate noisy pseudo-labels. Experimental results on different datasets show that MixGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, true positive rate, and true negative rate, demonstrating its robustness in large-scale IoT-cloud environments. The source code for MixGAN is publicly available. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The proliferation of cloud-integrated IoT systems has intensified exposure to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks due to the expanded attack surface, heterogeneous device behaviors, and limited edge protection. However, DDoS detection in this context remains challenging because of complex traffic dynamics, severe class imbalance, and scarce labeled data. While recent methods have explored solutions to address class imbalance, many still struggle to generalize under limited supervision and dynamic traffic conditions. To overcome these challenges, we propose MixGAN, a hybrid detection method that integrates conditional generation, semi-supervised learning, and robust feature extraction. Specifically, to handle complex temporal traffic patterns, we design a 1-D WideResNet backbone composed of temporal convolutional layers with residual connections, which effectively capture local burst patterns in traffic sequences. To alleviate class imbalance and label scarcity, we use a pretrained CTGAN to generate synthetic minority-class (DDoS attack) samples that complement unlabeled data. Furthermore, to mitigate the effect of noisy pseudo-labels, we introduce a MixUp-Average-Sharpen (MAS) strategy that constructs smoothed and sharpened targets by averaging predictions over augmented views and reweighting them towards high-confidence classes. Experiments on NSL-KDD, BoT-IoT, and CICIoT2023 demonstrate that MixGAN achieves up to 2.5% higher accuracy and 4% improvement in both TPR and TNR compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its robustness in large-scale IoT-cloud environments.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges posed by overly verbose reasoning chains in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting for large language models (LLMs) and proposes a new approach called Prompt-Only OverThinking (POT) to address these issues. Unlike previous overthinking attacks that rely on external knowledge sources or obvious templates, POT is a black-box attack framework that uses LLM-based iterative optimization to generate covert and natural adversarial prompts. This new approach eliminates the need for external data access and model retrieval, making it more practical for real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments across different model architectures and datasets show that POT outperforms other methods in generating adversarial prompts efficiently. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling sophisticated problem-solving through explicit multi-step reasoning traces. However, these enhanced reasoning processes introduce novel attack surfaces, particularly vulnerabilities to computational inefficiency through unnecessarily verbose reasoning chains that consume excessive resources without corresponding performance gains. Prior overthinking attacks typically require restrictive conditions including access to external knowledge sources for data poisoning, reliance on retrievable poisoned content, and structurally obvious templates that limit practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose POT (Prompt-Only OverThinking), a novel black-box attack framework that employs LLM-based iterative optimization to generate covert and semantically natural adversarial prompts, eliminating dependence on external data access and model retrieval. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures and datasets demonstrate that POT achieves superior performance compared to other methods.

Summary: 
The study focuses on using simulated environments for training Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) agents through Reinforcement Learning (RL) in a framework that extends CybORG's Cage Challenge 2 environment. The framework incorporates three new actions - Patch, Isolate, and Unisolate - to mimic real-world human operator capabilities. Additionally, modifications to the reward signals and feature space are proposed to enhance agent training performance. The study validates these modifications by training DQN and PPO agents in the enhanced environment, demonstrating that CybORG can be expanded with more realistic functionality while still providing informative training signals for RL agents. <div>

Abstract: Simulated environments have proven invaluable in Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) where Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents can be trained without the computational overhead of emulation. These environments must accurately represent cybersecurity scenarios while producing the necessary signals to support RL training. In this study, we present a framework where we first extend CybORG's Cage Challenge 2 environment by implementing three new actions: Patch, Isolate, and Unisolate, to better represent the capabilities available to human operators in real-world settings. We then propose a design for agent development where we modify the reward signals and the agent's feature space to enhance training performance. To validate these modifications, we train DQN and PPO agents in the updated environment. Our study demonstrates that CybORG can be extended with additional realistic functionality, while maintaining its ability to generate informative training signals for RL agents.

Summary:
FLAIRR-TS is a framework for time series forecasting with large language models (LLMs) that employs an agentic system for prompt optimization. The system consists of a forecaster-agent and a refiner agent, which work together to generate high-quality forecasts without the need for extensive pre-processing or code generation. By creatively designing prompt templates and leveraging past outputs and retrieved analogs, FLAIRR-TS can adaptively refine prompts across different domains, leading to improved forecasting accuracy compared to static prompting methods. This approach offers a practical alternative to manual prompt tuning and achieves performance levels approaching those of specialized prompts. FLAIRR-TS showcases the potential of utilizing agentic systems for optimizing forecasting tasks with LLMs. <div>

Effective fore-casting on LLM often relies on extensive pre-processing and fine-tuning.Recent studiesshow that a frozen LLM can rival specializedforecasters when supplied with a carefully en-gineered natural-language prompt, but craft-ing such a prompt for each task is itself oner-ous and ad-hoc. We introduce FLAIRR-TS, atest-time prompt optimization framework thatutilizes an agentic system: a Forecaster-agentgenerates forecasts using an initial prompt,which is then refined by a refiner agent, in-formed by past outputs and retrieved analogs.This adaptive prompting generalizes across do-mains using creative prompt templates andgenerates high-quality forecasts without inter-mediate code generation.Experiments onbenchmark datasets show improved accuracyover static prompting and retrieval-augmentedbaselines, approaching the performance ofspecialized prompts.FLAIRR-TS providesa practical alternative to tuning, achievingstrong performance via its agentic approach toadaptive prompt refinement and retrieval.

<div> Keywords: Artificial Intelligence, risk scoring framework, vulnerability assessment, governance, Monte Carlo simulation 

Summary: 
The paper introduces CORTEX, a multi-layered risk scoring framework designed to assess and score vulnerabilities in AI systems. Based on analysis of over 1,200 incidents in the AI Incident Database, CORTEX categorizes failure modes into 29 technical vulnerability groups and scores each vulnerability through a five-tier architecture. This framework combines likelihood x impact calculations adjusted for utility, governance and contextual overlays aligned with regulatory frameworks, technical surface scores, environmental and residual modifiers, and Bayesian risk aggregation. The resulting composite score can be utilized in AI risk registers, model audits, conformity checks, and governance dashboards. By using a comprehensive approach that considers various risk factors, CORTEX aims to address the evolving and practical risks associated with the deployment of AI systems in high-stakes sectors.

Abstract: As the deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in high-stakes sectors - like healthcare, finance, education, justice, and infrastructure has increased - the possibility and impact of failures of these systems have significantly evolved from being a theoretical possibility to practical recurring, systemic risk. This paper introduces CORTEX (Composite Overlay for Risk Tiering and Exposure), a multi-layered risk scoring framework proposed to assess and score AI system vulnerabilities, developed on empirical analysis of over 1,200 incidents documented in the AI Incident Database (AIID), CORTEX categorizes failure modes into 29 technical vulnerability groups. Each vulnerability is scored through a five-tier architecture that combines: (1) utility-adjusted Likelihood x Impact calculations; (2) governance + contextual overlays aligned with regulatory frameworks, such as the EU AI Act, NIST RMF, OECD principles; (3) technical surface scores, covering exposure vectors like drift, traceability, and adversarial risk; (4) environmental and residual modifiers tailored to context of where these systems are being deployed to use; and (5) a final layered assessment via Bayesian risk aggregation and Monte Carlo simulation to model volatility and long-tail risks. The resulting composite score can be operationalized across AI risk registers, model audits, conformity checks, and dynamic governance dashboards.

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Compression, Reinforcement Learning, Policy Optimization, End-task performance
<br />
Summary: 
CORE is a novel method for lossless context compression in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It uses reinforcement learning to optimize compression without predefined labels, using end-task performance as a reward signal. With a high compression ratio of 3%, CORE outperforms methods that prepend full documents by improving Exact Match score by 3.3 points. The approach ensures that compressed content effectively supports the end task, enhancing the accuracy of responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). The end-to-end training framework enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize answer accuracy. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of CORE in terms of performance and computational costs. This method addresses limitations in existing compression techniques and offers a promising solution for enhancing the timeliness and factual accuracy of knowledge retrieval in LLMs.

arXiv:2508.19282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the timeliness of knowledge and the factual accuracy of responses in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the inclusion of excessive retrieved documents substantially increases the input length, leading to higher computational costs. Previous studies have attempted to compress retrieved documents into shorter texts before in-context integration, but such methods often compromise end-task performance. The lack of well-defined compression targets forces many approaches to rely on fixed heuristics, which cannot guarantee that the compressed content will effectively support the end task. To address these limitations, we propose CORE, a novel method designed to achieve lossless context compression for RAG. CORE employs reinforcement learning to optimize the compression process without relying on predefined compression labels. Specifically, it utilizes end-task performance as a reward signal and applies Generalized Reinforcement Learning Policy Optimization (GRPO) to train the compressor. This end-to-end training framework enables the compressor to generate summaries that maximize the accuracy of answers generated by the LLM. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. With a high compression ratio of 3\%, our method not only avoids performance degradation compared to prepending full documents across all datasets but also improves the average Exact Match (EM) score by 3.3 points. The code will be released soon.

<div> Keywords: machine learning, privacy preservation, large language models, reinforcement learning, data generation

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the challenge of balancing user privacy and data utility when training large language models (LLMs). They propose a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes the LLM using a composite reward function, optimizing for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and output diversity. The privacy reward takes into account semantic cues and structural patterns from a minimum spanning tree over latent representations to guide the model in generating synthetic rewrites that protect privacy while preserving utility. Empirical results show that the proposed method significantly improves author obfuscation and privacy metrics without compromising semantic quality. This scalable and model-agnostic approach offers a solution for privacy-preserving data generation in the context of large language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.19286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of modern machine learning systems depends on access to large, high-quality datasets, often sourced from user-generated content or proprietary, domain-specific corpora. However, these rich datasets inherently contain sensitive personal information, raising significant concerns about privacy, data security, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. While conventional anonymization techniques can remove explicit identifiers, such removal may result in performance drop in downstream machine learning tasks. More importantly, simple anonymization may not be effective against inference attacks that exploit implicit signals such as writing style, topical focus, or demographic cues, highlighting the need for more robust privacy safeguards during model training. To address the challenging issue of balancing user privacy and data utility, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) using a composite reward function that jointly optimizes for explicit and implicit privacy, semantic fidelity, and output diversity. To effectively capture population level regularities, the privacy reward combines semantic cues with structural patterns derived from a minimum spanning tree (MST) over latent representations. By modeling these privacy-sensitive signals in their distributional context, the proposed approach guides the model to generate synthetic rewrites that preserve utility while mitigating privacy risks. Empirical results show that the proposed method significantly enhances author obfuscation and privacy metrics without degrading semantic quality, providing a scalable and model-agnostic solution for privacy preserving data generation in the era of large language models.

Abstract: We present an unsupervised slide-quality assessment pipeline that combines seven expert-inspired visual-design metrics (whitespace, colorfulness, edge density, brightness contrast, text density, color harmony, layout balance) with CLIP-ViT embeddings, using Isolation Forest-based anomaly scoring to evaluate presentation slides. Trained on 12k professional lecture slides and evaluated on six academic talks (115 slides), our method achieved Pearson correlations up to 0.83 with human visual-quality ratings-1.79x to 3.23x stronger than scores from leading vision-language models (ChatGPT o4-mini-high, ChatGPT o3, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro). We demonstrate convergent validity with visual ratings, discriminant validity against speaker-delivery scores, and exploratory alignment with overall impressions. Our results show that augmenting low-level design cues with multimodal embeddings closely approximates audience perceptions of slide quality, enabling scalable, objective feedback in real time.

Summary: 
This paper presents a novel efficient model-based purification framework tailored for defending against adversarial attacks in 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation in autonomous vehicles. The study highlights the vulnerability of segmentation networks to adversarial attacks and introduces a direct attack formulation in the range-view domain. The developed purification network is mathematically justified and offers strong resilience against adversarial attacks with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: LiDAR-based segmentation is essential for reliable perception in autonomous vehicles, yet modern segmentation networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that can compromise safety. Most existing defenses are designed for networks operating directly on raw 3D point clouds and rely on large, computationally intensive generative models. However, many state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation pipelines operate on more efficient 2D range view representations. Despite their widespread adoption, dedicated lightweight adversarial defenses for this domain remain largely unexplored. We introduce an efficient model-based purification framework tailored for adversarial defense in 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation. We propose a direct attack formulation in the range-view domain and develop an explainable purification network based on a mathematical justified optimization problem, achieving strong adversarial resilience with minimal computational overhead. Our method achieves competitive performance on open benchmarks, consistently outperforming generative and adversarial training baselines. More importantly, real-world deployment on a demo vehicle demonstrates the framework's ability to deliver accurate operation in practical autonomous driving scenarios.

Summary:
Jailbreaking large language models (LLMs) can lead to the generation of malicious content, highlighting the need for robust security frameworks. Existing techniques such as the "jailbreak prompt" can bypass safety constraints in LLMs. To address the inefficiency and repetitive nature of current jailbreak methods, a new automated framework called JailExpert is proposed. JailExpert formalizes experience structure, groups experiences based on semantic drift, and supports dynamic updating of the experience pool. Extensive experiments show that JailExpert improves attack effectiveness and efficiency, with a 17% increase in attack success rate and 2.7 times improvement in attack efficiency compared to current black-box methods.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate human-aligned content under certain safety constraints. However, the current known technique ``jailbreak prompt'' can circumvent safety-aligned measures and induce LLMs to output malicious content. Research on Jailbreaking can help identify vulnerabilities in LLMs and guide the development of robust security frameworks. To circumvent the issue of attack templates becoming obsolete as models evolve, existing methods adopt iterative mutation and dynamic optimization to facilitate more automated jailbreak attacks. However, these methods face two challenges: inefficiency and repetitive optimization, as they overlook the value of past attack experiences. To better integrate past attack experiences to assist current jailbreak attempts, we propose the \textbf{JailExpert}, an automated jailbreak framework, which is the first to achieve a formal representation of experience structure, group experiences based on semantic drift, and support the dynamic updating of the experience pool. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailExpert significantly improves both attack effectiveness and efficiency. Compared to the current state-of-the-art black-box jailbreak methods, JailExpert achieves an average increase of 17\% in attack success rate and 2.7 times improvement in attack efficiency.

Summary: <br />
Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in biometric face recognition tasks, but concerns about demographic biases persist. In the study DemoBias, three LVLMs (LLaVA, BLIP-2, and PaliGemma) were fine-tuned and evaluated on a dataset with demographic balance. The results revealed disparities in performance across different demographic groups, with PaliGemma and LLaVA showing higher biases for Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian, and South Asian groups compared to BLIP-2. Evaluation metrics such as group-specific BERTScores and the Fairness Discrepancy Rate were used to quantify these disparities. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing demographic biases in LVLMs to ensure equitable performance across diverse groups.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various downstream tasks, including biometric face recognition (FR) with description. However, demographic biases remain a critical concern in FR, as these foundation models often fail to perform equitably across diverse demographic groups, considering ethnicity/race, gender, and age. Therefore, through our work DemoBias, we conduct an empirical evaluation to investigate the extent of demographic biases in LVLMs for biometric FR with textual token generation tasks. We fine-tuned and evaluated three widely used pre-trained LVLMs: LLaVA, BLIP-2, and PaliGemma on our own generated demographic-balanced dataset. We utilize several evaluation metrics, like group-specific BERTScores and the Fairness Discrepancy Rate, to quantify and trace the performance disparities. The experimental results deliver compelling insights into the fairness and reliability of LVLMs across diverse demographic groups. Our empirical study uncovered demographic biases in LVLMs, with PaliGemma and LLaVA exhibiting higher disparities for Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian, and South Asian groups, whereas BLIP-2 demonstrated comparably consistent.

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) pose a significant clinical risk due to their potential for rupture, which is often asymptomatic but can be fatal. Although maximum diameter is commonly used for risk assessment, diameter alone is insufficient as it does not capture the properties of the underlying material of the vessel wall, which play a critical role in determining the risk of rupture. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep learning-based framework for elasticity imaging of AAAs with 2D ultrasound. Leveraging finite element simulations, we generate a diverse dataset of displacement fields with their corresponding modulus distributions. We train a model with U-Net architecture and normalized mean squared error (NMSE) to infer the spatial modulus distribution from the axial and lateral components of the displacement fields. This model is evaluated across three experimental domains: digital phantom data from 3D COMSOL simulations, physical phantom experiments using biomechanically distinct vessel models, and clinical ultrasound exams from AAA patients. Our simulated results demonstrate that the proposed deep learning model is able to reconstruct modulus distributions, achieving an NMSE score of 0.73\%. Similarly, in phantom data, the predicted modular ratio closely matches the expected values, affirming the model's ability to generalize to phantom data. We compare our approach with an iterative method which shows comparable performance but higher computation time. In contrast, the deep learning method can provide quick and effective estimates of tissue stiffness from ultrasound images, which could help assess the risk of AAA rupture without invasive procedures.

<div> Keywords: Floridi's conjecture, artificial intelligence, certainty, scope, ontological assumption

Summary:
This paper critically examines Floridi's conjecture on the trade-off between certainty and scope in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. It argues that the conjecture, while theoretically sound, falls short in practical application due to its reliance on incomputable constructs and the assumption of AI systems as self-contained entities. These limitations hinder its potential to inform engineering design and regulatory decision-making in real-world AI systems. The paper proposes a reframing of Floridi's challenge to address the epistemic burdens of AI within complex human-centric domains, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical implementation in AI hybrid systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Floridi's conjecture offers a compelling intuition about the fundamental trade-off between certainty and scope in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. This exploration remains crucial, not merely as a philosophical exercise, but as a potential compass for guiding AI investments, particularly in safety-critical industrial domains where the level of attention will surely be higher in the future. However, while intellectually coherent, its formalization ultimately freezes this insight into a suspended epistemic truth, resisting operationalization within real-world systems. This paper is a result of an analysis arguing that the conjecture's ambition to provide insights to engineering design and regulatory decision-making is constrained by two critical factors: first, its reliance on incomputable constructs - rendering it practically unactionable and unverifiable; second, its underlying ontological assumption of AI systems as self-contained epistemic entities - separating it from the intricate and dynamic socio-technical environments in which knowledge is co-constructed. We conclude that this dual breakdown - an epistemic closure deficit and an embeddedness bypass - prevents the conjecture from transitioning into a computable and actionable framework suitable for informing the design, deployment, and governance of real-world AI hybrid systems. In response, we propose a contribution to the framing of Floridi's epistemic challenge, addressing the inherent epistemic burdens of AI within complex human-centric domains.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Spatial representation learning is crucial for GeoAI applications, enabling the encoding of shapes, locations, and spatial relationships of geo-entities. Existing methods face limitations in targeting a single geo-entity type and introducing high computational costs. Geo2Vec, inspired by signed distance fields, directly operates in the original space, adaptively sampling points and encoding their signed distances to capture geometry without decomposition. A neural network approximates the SDF, producing compact, geometry-aware representations for all geo-entity types. Additionally, a rotation-invariant positional encoding models high-frequency spatial variations, creating a structured and robust embedding space. Empirical results demonstrate Geo2Vec's superiority in representing shape and location, capturing topological and distance relationships, and enhancing efficiency in real-world GeoAI applications. <div>

Abstract: Spatial representation learning is essential for GeoAI applications such as urban analytics, enabling the encoding of shapes, locations, and spatial relationships (topological and distance-based) of geo-entities like points, polylines, and polygons. Existing methods either target a single geo-entity type or, like Poly2Vec, decompose entities into simpler components to enable Fourier transformation, introducing high computational cost. Moreover, since the transformed space lacks geometric alignment, these methods rely on uniform, non-adaptive sampling, which blurs fine-grained features like edges and boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geo2Vec, a novel method inspired by signed distance fields (SDF) that operates directly in the original space. Geo2Vec adaptively samples points and encodes their signed distances (positive outside, negative inside), capturing geometry without decomposition. A neural network trained to approximate the SDF produces compact, geometry-aware, and unified representations for all geo-entity types. Additionally, we propose a rotation-invariant positional encoding to model high-frequency spatial variations and construct a structured and robust embedding space for downstream GeoAI models. Empirical results show that Geo2Vec consistently outperforms existing methods in representing shape and location, capturing topological and distance relationships, and achieving greater efficiency in real-world GeoAI applications.

Abstract: Rice is a staple food of global importance in terms of trade, nutrition, and economic growth. Among Asian nations such as China, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia are leading producers of both long and short grain varieties, including basmati, jasmine, arborio, ipsala, and kainat saila. To ensure consumer satisfaction and strengthen national reputations, monitoring rice crops and grain quality is essential. Manual inspection, however, is labour intensive, time consuming and error prone, highlighting the need for automated solutions for quality control and yield improvement. This study proposes an automated approach to classify five rice grain varieties using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A publicly available dataset of 75000 images was used for training and testing. Model evaluation employed accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. Results demonstrated high classification accuracy with minimal misclassifications, confirming the model effectiveness in distinguishing rice varieties. In addition, an accurate diagnostic method for rice leaf diseases such as Brown Spot, Blast, Bacterial Blight, and Tungro was developed. The framework combined explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with deep learning models including CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. Explainability techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) revealed how specific grain and leaf features influenced predictions, enhancing model transparency and reliability. The findings demonstrate the strong potential of deep learning in agricultural applications, paving the way for robust, interpretable systems that can support automated crop quality inspection and disease diagnosis, ultimately benefiting farmers, consumers, and the agricultural economy.

<title>Are Companies Taking AI Risks Seriously? A Systematic Analysis of Companies' AI Risk Disclosures in SEC 10-K forms</title>

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence becomes increasingly central to corporate strategies, concerns over its risks are growing too. In response, regulators are pushing for greater transparency in how companies identify, report and mitigate AI-related risks. In the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) repeatedly warned companies to provide their investors with more accurate disclosures of AI-related risks; recent enforcement and litigation against companies' misleading AI claims reinforce these warnings. In the EU, new laws - like the AI Act and Digital Services Act - introduced additional rules on AI risk reporting and mitigation. Given these developments, it is essential to examine if and how companies report AI-related risks to the public. This study presents the first large-scale systematic analysis of AI risk disclosures in SEC 10-K filings, which require public companies to report material risks to their company. We analyse over 30,000 filings from more than 7,000 companies over the past five years, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis. Our findings reveal a sharp increase in the companies that mention AI risk, up from 4% in 2020 to over 43% in the most recent 2024 filings. While legal and competitive AI risks are the most frequently mentioned, we also find growing attention to societal AI risks, such as cyberattacks, fraud, and technical limitations of AI systems. However, many disclosures remain generic or lack details on mitigation strategies, echoing concerns raised recently by the SEC about the quality of AI-related risk reporting. To support future research, we publicly release a web-based tool for easily extracting and analysing keyword-based disclosures across SEC filings.

Abstract: Accurate classification of terrestrial habitats is critical for biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and land-use planning. Several habitat classification schemes are in use, typically based on analysis of satellite imagery with validation by field ecologists. Here we present a methodology for classification of habitats based solely on ground-level imagery (photographs), offering improved validation and the ability to classify habitats at scale (for example using citizen-science imagery). In collaboration with Natural England, a public sector organisation responsible for nature conservation in England, this study develops a classification system that applies deep learning to ground-level habitat photographs, categorising each image into one of 18 classes defined by the 'Living England' framework. Images were pre-processed using resizing, normalisation, and augmentation; re-sampling was used to balance classes in the training data and enhance model robustness. We developed and fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label to each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated strong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and F1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean F1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and Peat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or ambiguous classes scoring lower. These findings demonstrate the potential of this approach for ecological monitoring. Ground-level imagery is readily obtained, and accurate computational methods for habitat classification based on such data have many potential applications. To support use by practitioners, we also provide a simple web application that classifies uploaded images using our model.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence rapidly transforms society, developers and policymakers struggle to anticipate which applications will face public moral resistance. We propose that these judgments are not idiosyncratic but systematic and predictable. In a large, preregistered study (N = 587, U.S. representative sample), we used a comprehensive taxonomy of 100 AI applications spanning personal and organizational contexts-including both functional uses and the moral treatment of AI itself. In participants' collective judgment, applications ranged from highly unacceptable to fully acceptable. We found this variation was strongly predictable: five core moral qualities-perceived risk, benefit, dishonesty, unnaturalness, and reduced accountability-collectively explained over 90% of the variance in acceptability ratings. The framework demonstrated strong predictive power across all domains and successfully predicted individual-level judgments for held-out applications. These findings reveal that a structured moral psychology underlies public evaluation of new technologies, offering a powerful tool for anticipating public resistance and guiding responsible innovation in AI.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an efficient approach to resource allocation due to its strong capability in handling complex decision-making tasks. However, only limited research has explored the training of DRL models with real-world data in practical, distributed Internet of Things (IoT) systems. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for training DRL models in real-world distributed IoT environments. In the proposed framework, IoT devices select communication channels using a DRL-based method, while the DRL model is trained with feedback information. Specifically, Acknowledgment (ACK) information is obtained from actual data transmissions over the selected channels. Implementation and performance evaluation, in terms of Frame Success Rate (FSR), are carried out, demonstrating both the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Accurate sarcopenia diagnosis via ultrasound remains challenging due to subtle imaging cues, limited labeled data, and the absence of clinical context in most models. We propose MedVQA-TREE, a multimodal framework that integrates a hierarchical image interpretation module, a gated feature-level fusion mechanism, and a novel multi-hop, multi-query retrieval strategy. The vision module includes anatomical classification, region segmentation, and graph-based spatial reasoning to capture coarse, mid-level, and fine-grained structures. A gated fusion mechanism selectively integrates visual features with textual queries, while clinical knowledge is retrieved through a UMLS-guided pipeline accessing PubMed and a sarcopenia-specific external knowledge base. MedVQA-TREE was trained and evaluated on two public MedVQA datasets (VQA-RAD and PathVQA) and a custom sarcopenia ultrasound dataset. The model achieved up to 99% diagnostic accuracy and outperformed previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10%. These results underscore the benefit of combining structured visual understanding with guided knowledge retrieval for effective AI-assisted diagnosis in sarcopenia.

Abstract: Recently, interactive digital human video generation has attracted widespread attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, building such a practical system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with high latency, heavy computational cost, and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.

Abstract: With the widespread use of large language models (LLMs), understanding their potential failure modes during user interactions is essential. In practice, users often pose multiple questions in a single conversation with LLMs. Therefore, in this study, we propose Group Query Attack, a technique that simulates this scenario by presenting groups of queries to LLMs simultaneously. We investigate how the accumulated context from consecutive prompts influences the outputs of LLMs. Specifically, we observe that Group Query Attack significantly degrades the performance of models fine-tuned on specific tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that Group Query Attack induces a risk of triggering potential backdoors of LLMs. Besides, Group Query Attack is also effective in tasks involving reasoning, such as mathematical reasoning and code generation for pre-trained and aligned models.

Abstract: Agentic AI is advancing rapidly, yet truly autonomous medical-imaging triage, where a system decides when to stop, escalate, or defer under real constraints, remains relatively underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce AT-CXR, an uncertainty-aware agent for chest X-rays. The system estimates per-case confidence and distributional fit, then follows a stepwise policy to issue an automated decision or abstain with a suggested label for human intervention. We evaluate two router designs that share the same inputs and actions: a deterministic rule-based router and an LLM-decided router. Across five-fold evaluation on a balanced subset of NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, both variants outperform strong zero-shot vision-language models and state-of-the-art supervised classifiers, achieving higher full-coverage accuracy and superior selective-prediction performance, evidenced by a lower area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) and a lower error rate at high coverage, while operating with lower latency that meets practical clinical constraints. The two routers provide complementary operating points, enabling deployments to prioritize maximal throughput or maximal accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/XLIAaron/uncertainty-aware-cxr-agent.

Abstract: ICAO-compliant facial images, initially designed for secure biometric passports, are increasingly becoming central to identity verification in a wide range of application contexts, including border control, digital travel credentials, and financial services. While their standardization enables global interoperability, it also facilitates practices such as morphing and deepfakes, which can be exploited for harmful purposes like identity theft and illegal sharing of identity documents. Traditional countermeasures like Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) are limited to real-time capture and offer no post-capture protection. This survey paper investigates digital watermarking and steganography as complementary solutions that embed tamper-evident signals directly into the image, enabling persistent verification without compromising ICAO compliance. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art techniques to evaluate the potential and drawbacks of the underlying approaches concerning the applications involving ICAO-compliant images and their suitability under standard constraints. We highlight key trade-offs, offering guidance for secure deployment in real-world identity systems.

Abstract: Bell's theorem reveals a profound conflict between quantum mechanics and local realism, a conflict we reinterpret through the modern lens of causal inference. We propose and computationally validate a framework where quantum entanglement acts as a "super-confounding" resource, generating correlations that violate the classical causal bounds set by Bell's inequalities. This work makes three key contributions: First, we establish a physical hierarchy of confounding (Quantum > Classical) and introduce Confounding Strength (CS) to quantify this effect. Second, we provide a circuit-based implementation of the quantum $\mathcal{DO}$-calculus to distinguish causality from spurious correlation. Finally, we apply this calculus to a quantum machine learning problem, where causal feature selection yields a statistically significant 11.3% average absolute improvement in model robustness. Our framework bridges quantum foundations and causal AI, offering a new, practical perspective on quantum correlations.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) often deals with suboptimal data when collecting large expert datasets is unavailable or impractical. This limitation makes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as they must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A central challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert demonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that incorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve RL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From Associative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL policy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset. During training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data from the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and integrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation. This requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone architecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points. These results show that Re:Frame offers a simple and data-efficient way to inject scarce expert knowledge and substantially improve offline RL from low-quality datasets.

Abstract: Event Extraction (EE) involves automatically identifying and extracting structured information about events from unstructured text, including triggers, event types, and arguments. Traditional discriminative models demonstrate high precision but often exhibit limited recall, particularly for nuanced or infrequent events. Conversely, generative approaches leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) provide higher semantic flexibility and recall but suffer from hallucinations and inconsistent predictions. To address these challenges, we propose Agreement-based Reflective Inference System (ARIS), a hybrid approach combining a Self Mixture of Agents with a discriminative sequence tagger. ARIS explicitly leverages structured model consensus, confidence-based filtering, and an LLM reflective inference module to reliably resolve ambiguities and enhance overall event prediction quality. We further investigate decomposed instruction fine-tuning for enhanced LLM event extraction understanding. Experiments demonstrate our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art event extraction methods across three benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, increasing the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications. While AF detection algorithms perform well in identifying persistent AF, early-stage progression, such as paroxysmal AF (PAF), often goes undetected due to its sudden onset and short duration. However, undetected PAF can progress into sustained AF, increasing the risk of mortality and severe complications. Early prediction of AF offers an opportunity to reduce disease progression through preventive therapies, such as catecholamine-sparing agents or beta-blockers. In this study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR Intervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for positional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early prediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling. In subject-wise testing results, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.908, specificity of 0.933, F1-score of 0.930, AUROC of 0.972, and AUPRC of 0.932. Additionally, our method demonstrates high computational efficiency, with only 73.5 thousand parameters and 38.3 MFLOPs, outperforming traditional Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) approaches in both accuracy and model compactness. Notably, the model can predict AF up to two hours in advance using just 30 minutes of input data, providing enough lead time for preventive interventions.

Abstract: Existing long-context benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) focus on evaluating comprehension of long inputs, while overlooking the evaluation of long reasoning abilities. To address this gap, we introduce LongReasonArena, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the long reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our tasks require models to solve problems by executing multi-step algorithms that reflect key aspects of long reasoning, such as retrieval and backtracking. By controlling the inputs, the required reasoning length can be arbitrarily scaled, reaching up to 1 million tokens of reasoning for the most challenging tasks. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that LongReasonArena presents a significant challenge for both open-source and proprietary LLMs. For instance, Deepseek-R1 achieves only 7.5% accuracy on our task. Further analysis also reveals that the accuracy exhibits a linear decline with respect to the logarithm of the expected number of reasoning steps. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/LongReasonArena/LongReasonArena.

<title>Grounding the Ungrounded: A Spectral-Graph Framework for Quantifying Hallucinations in multimodal LLMs</title>

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing. This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable, analyzable phenomenon.

Abstract: As robots' manipulation capabilities improve for pick-and-place tasks (e.g., object packing, sorting, and kitting), methods focused on understanding human-acceptable object configurations remain limited expressively with regard to capturing spatial relationships important to humans. To advance robotic understanding of human rules for object arrangement, we introduce positionally-augmented RCC (PARCC), a formal logic framework based on region connection calculus (RCC) for describing the relative position of objects in space. Additionally, we introduce an inference algorithm for learning PARCC specifications via demonstrations. Finally, we present the results from a human study, which demonstrate our framework's ability to capture a human's intended specification and the benefits of learning from demonstration approaches over human-provided specifications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Database Entity Recognition (DB-ER) in Natural Language Queries (NLQ). We present several key contributions to advance this field: (1) a human-annotated benchmark for DB-ER task, derived from popular text-to-sql benchmarks, (2) a novel data augmentation procedure that leverages automatic annotation of NLQs based on the corresponding SQL queries which are available in popular text-to-SQL benchmarks, (3) a specialized language model based entity recognition model using T5 as a backbone and two down-stream DB-ER tasks: sequence tagging and token classification for fine-tuning of backend and performing DB-ER respectively. We compared our DB-ER tagger with two state-of-the-art NER taggers, and observed better performance in both precision and recall for our model. The ablation evaluation shows that data augmentation boosts precision and recall by over 10%, while fine-tuning of the T5 backbone boosts these metrics by 5-10%.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown strong potential for multimodal reasoning beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the use of a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM), based on LLaMA 3.2, for classifying neutrino interactions from pixelated detector images in high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark its performance against an established CNN baseline used in experiments like NOvA and DUNE, evaluating metrics such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Our results show that the VLM not only matches or exceeds CNN performance but also enables richer reasoning and better integration of auxiliary textual or semantic context. These findings suggest that VLMs offer a promising general-purpose backbone for event classification in HEP, paving the way for multimodal approaches in experimental neutrino physics.

<title>One Joke to Rule them All? On the (Im)possibility of Generalizing Humor</title>

Abstract: Humor is a broad and complex form of communication that remains challenging for machines. Despite its broadness, most existing research on computational humor traditionally focused on modeling a specific type of humor. In this work, we wish to understand whether competence on one or more specific humor tasks confers any ability to transfer to novel, unseen types; in other words, is this fragmentation inevitable? This question is especially timely as new humor types continuously emerge in online and social media contexts (e.g., memes, anti-humor, AI fails). If Large Language Models (LLMs) are to keep up with this evolving landscape, they must be able to generalize across humor types by capturing deeper, transferable mechanisms. To investigate this, we conduct a series of transfer learning experiments across four datasets, representing different humor tasks. We train LLMs under varied diversity settings (1-3 datasets in training, testing on a novel task). Experiments reveal that models are capable of some transfer, and can reach up to 75% accuracy on unseen datasets; training on diverse sources improves transferability (1.88-4.05%) with minimal-to-no drop in in-domain performance. Further analysis suggests relations between humor types, with Dad Jokes surprisingly emerging as the best enabler of transfer (but is difficult to transfer to). We release data and code.

<title>Even Heads Fix Odd Errors: Mechanistic Discovery and Surgical Repair in Transformer Attention</title>

Abstract: We present a mechanistic case study of a format-dependent reasoning failure in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, where the model incorrectly judges "9.11" as larger than "9.8" in chat or Q&amp;A formats, but answers correctly in simple format. Through systematic intervention, we discover transformers implement even/odd attention head specialization: even indexed heads handle numerical comparison, while odd heads serve incompatible functions. The bug requires exactly 8 even heads at Layer 10 for perfect repair. Any combination of 8+ even heads succeeds, while 7 or fewer completely fails, revealing sharp computational thresholds with perfect redundancy among the 16 even heads. SAE analysis reveals the mechanism: format representations separate (10% feature overlap at Layer 7), then re-entangle with different weightings (80% feature overlap at Layer 10), with specific features showing 1.5x amplification in failing formats. We achieve perfect repair using only 25% of attention heads and identify a 60% pattern replacement threshold, demonstrating that apparent full-module requirements hide sophisticated substructure with implications for interpretability and efficiency.

Abstract: The 2020s have been witnessing a very significant advance in the development of generative artificial intelligence tools, including text generation systems based on large language models. These tools have been increasingly used to generate texts in the most diverse domains -- from technical texts to literary texts --, which might eventually lead to a lower volume of written text production by humans. This article discusses the possibility of a future in which human beings will have lost or significantly decreased their ability to write due to the outsourcing of this activity to machines. This possibility parallels the loss of the ability to write in other moments of human history, such as during the so-called Greek Dark Ages (approx. 1200 BCE - 800 BCE).

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation. Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually trained on solution trajectories obtained by long time integration of the PDE solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10 timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model, which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show that our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories.

Abstract: Personas have been widely used to understand and communicate user needs in human-centred design. Despite their utility, they may fail to meet the demands of iterative workflows due to their static nature, limited engagement, and inability to adapt to evolving design needs. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) pave the way for more engaging and adaptive approaches to user representation. This paper introduces Interactive Virtual Personas (IVPs): multimodal, LLM-driven, conversational user simulations that designers can interview, brainstorm with, and gather feedback from in real time via voice interface. We conducted a qualitative study with eight professional UX designers, employing an IVP named "Alice" across three design activities: user research, ideation, and prototype evaluation. Our findings demonstrate the potential of IVPs to expedite information gathering, inspire design solutions, and provide rapid user-like feedback. However, designers raised concerns about biases, over-optimism, the challenge of ensuring authenticity without real stakeholder input, and the inability of the IVP to fully replicate the nuances of human interaction. Our participants emphasised that IVPs should be viewed as a complement to, not a replacement for, real user engagement. We discuss strategies for prompt engineering, human-in-the-loop integration, and ethical considerations for effective and responsible IVP use in design. Finally, our work contributes to the growing body of research on generative AI in the design process by providing insights into UX designers' experiences of LLM-powered interactive personas.

Abstract: The disparity in language resources poses a challenge in multilingual NLP, with high-resource languages benefiting from extensive data, while low-resource languages lack sufficient data for effective training. Our Contrastive Language Alignment with Prompting (CoLAP) method addresses this gap by integrating contrastive learning with cross-lingual representations, facilitating task-specific knowledge transfer from high-resource to lower-resource languages. The primary advantage of our approach is its data efficiency, enabling rapid adaptation to new languages and reducing the need for large labeled datasets. We conduct experiments with multilingual encoder-only and decoder-only language models on natural language understanding tasks, including natural language inference and relation extraction, evaluating performance across both high- and low-resource languages. Our results demonstrate that CoLAP outperforms few-shot cross-lingual transfer baselines and in-context learning, even with limited available data. This effectively narrows the cross-lingual performance gap, contributing to the development of more efficient multilingual NLP techniques.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Electric Vehicle Charging Systems (EVCs) has introduced new cybersecurity challenges, specifically in authentication protocols that protect vehicles, users, and energy infrastructure. Although widely adopted for convenience, traditional authentication mechanisms like Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) and Near Field Communication (NFC) rely on static identifiers and weak encryption, making them highly vulnerable to attack vectors such as cloning, relay attacks, and signal interception. This study explores an AI-powered adaptive authentication framework designed to overcome these shortcomings by integrating machine learning, anomaly detection, behavioral analytics, and contextual risk assessment. Grounded in the principles of Zero Trust Architecture, the proposed framework emphasizes continuous verification, least privilege access, and secure communication. Through a comprehensive literature review, this research evaluates current vulnerabilities and highlights AI-driven solutions to provide a scalable, resilient, and proactive defense. Ultimately, the research findings conclude that adopting AI-powered adaptive authentication is a strategic imperative for securing the future of electric mobility and strengthening digital trust across the ecosystem.

Abstract: We study incentivized exploration in multi-armed bandit (MAB) settings with infinitely many arms modeled as elements in continuous metric spaces. Unlike classical bandit models, we consider scenarios where the decision-maker (principal) incentivizes myopic agents to explore beyond their greedy choices through compensation, but with the complication of reward drift--biased feedback arising due to the incentives. We propose novel incentivized exploration algorithms that discretize the infinite arm space uniformly and demonstrate that these algorithms simultaneously achieve sublinear cumulative regret and sublinear total compensation. Specifically, we derive regret and compensation bounds of $\Tilde{O}(T^{d+1/d+2})$, with $d$ representing the covering dimension of the metric space. Furthermore, we generalize our results to contextual bandits, achieving comparable performance guarantees. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations.

Abstract: Nonmedical opioid use is an urgent public health challenge, with far-reaching clinical and social consequences that are often underreported in traditional healthcare settings. Social media platforms, where individuals candidly share first-person experiences, offer a valuable yet underutilized source of insight into these impacts. In this study, we present a named entity recognition (NER) framework to extract two categories of self-reported consequences from social media narratives related to opioid use: ClinicalImpacts (e.g., withdrawal, depression) and SocialImpacts (e.g., job loss). To support this task, we introduce RedditImpacts 2.0, a high-quality dataset with refined annotation guidelines and a focus on first-person disclosures, addressing key limitations of prior work. We evaluate both fine-tuned encoder-based models and state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) under zero- and few-shot in-context learning settings. Our fine-tuned DeBERTa-large model achieves a relaxed token-level F1 of 0.61 [95% CI: 0.43-0.62], consistently outperforming LLMs in precision, span accuracy, and adherence to task-specific guidelines. Furthermore, we show that strong NER performance can be achieved with substantially less labeled data, emphasizing the feasibility of deploying robust models in resource-limited settings. Our findings underscore the value of domain-specific fine-tuning for clinical NLP tasks and contribute to the responsible development of AI tools that may enhance addiction surveillance, improve interpretability, and support real-world healthcare decision-making. The best performing model, however, still significantly underperforms compared to inter-expert agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.81), demonstrating that a gap persists between expert intelligence and current state-of-the-art NER/AI capabilities for tasks requiring deep domain knowledge.

Abstract: Sensitive Information Exposure (SIEx) vulnerabilities (CWE-200) remain a persistent and under-addressed threat across software systems, often leading to serious security breaches. Existing detection tools rarely target the diverse subcategories of CWE-200 or provide context-aware analysis of code-level data flows.
  Aims: This paper aims to present SIExVulTS, a novel vulnerability detection system that integrates transformer-based models with static analysis to identify and verify sensitive information exposure in Java applications.
  Method: SIExVulTS employs a three-stage architecture: (1) an Attack Surface Detection Engine that uses sentence embeddings to identify sensitive variables, strings, comments, and sinks; (2) an Exposure Analysis Engine that instantiates CodeQL queries aligned with the CWE-200 hierarchy; and (3) a Flow Verification Engine that leverages GraphCodeBERT to semantically validate source-to-sink flows. We evaluate SIExVulTS using three curated datasets, including real-world CVEs, a benchmark set of synthetic CWE-200 examples, and labeled flows from 31 open-source projects.
  Results: The Attack Surface Detection Engine achieved an average F1 score greater than 93\%, the Exposure Analysis Engine achieved an F1 score of 85.71\%, and the Flow Verification Engine increased precision from 22.61\% to 87.23\%. Moreover, SIExVulTS successfully uncovered six previously unknown CVEs in major Apache projects.
  Conclusions: The results demonstrate that SIExVulTS is effective and practical for improving software security against sensitive data exposure, addressing limitations of existing tools in detecting and verifying CWE-200 vulnerabilities.

Abstract: \Abstract{In the realm of education, student evaluation holds equal significance as imparting knowledge. To be evaluated, students usually need to go through text-based academic assessment methods. Instructors need to make diverse sets of questions that need to be fair for all students to prove their adequacy over a particular topic. This can prove to be quite challenging as they may need to manually go through several different lecture materials. Our objective is to make this whole process much easier by implementing Automatic Question Answer Generation /(AQAG), using fine-tuned generative LLM. For tailoring the instructor's preferred question style (MCQ, conceptual, or factual questions), prompt Engineering (PE) is being utilized. In this research, we propose to leverage unsupervised learning methods in NLP, primarily focusing on the English language. This approach empowers the base Meta-Llama 2-7B model to integrate RACE dataset as training data for the fine-tuning process. Creating a customized model that will offer efficient solutions for educators, instructors, and individuals engaged in text-based evaluations. A reliable and efficient tool for generating questions and answers can free up valuable time and resources, thus streamlining their evaluation processes.}

Abstract: This study aimed to: (1) understand whether commercially available computer-vision and artificial intelligence (AI) player tracking software can accurately measure player position, speed and distance using broadcast footage and (2) determine the impact of camera feed and resolution on accuracy. Data were obtained from one match at the 2022 Qatar Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. Tactical, programme and camera 1 feeds were used. Three commercial tracking providers that use computer-vision and AI participated. Providers analysed instantaneous position (x, y coordinates) and speed (m\,s^{-1}) of each player. Their data were compared with a high-definition multi-camera tracking system (TRACAB Gen 5). Root mean square error (RMSE) and mean bias were calculated. Position RMSE ranged from 1.68 to 16.39 m, while speed RMSE ranged from 0.34 to 2.38 m\,s^{-1}. Total match distance mean bias ranged from -1745 m (-21.8%) to 1945 m (24.3%) across providers. Computer-vision and AI player tracking software offer the ability to track players with fair precision when players are detected by the software. Providers should use a tactical feed when tracking position and speed, which will maximise player detection, improving accuracy. Both 720p and 1080p resolutions are suitable, assuming appropriate computer-vision and AI models are implemented.

Abstract: Low-resource machine translation remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs), which often lack exposure to these languages during pretraining and have limited parallel data for fine-tuning. We propose a novel approach that enhances translation for low-resource languages by integrating an external dictionary tool and training models end-to-end using reinforcement learning, in addition to supervised fine-tuning. Focusing on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki language pair, we frame translation as a tool-augmented decision-making problem in which the model can selectively consult a bilingual dictionary during generation. Our method combines supervised instruction tuning with Guided Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO), enabling the model to learn both when and how to use the tool effectively. BLEU similarity scores are used as rewards to guide this learning process. Preliminary results show that our tool-augmented models achieve up to +3.37 BLEU improvement over previous work, and a 18% relative gain compared to a supervised baseline without dictionary access, on the Spanish-Wayuunaiki test set from the AmericasNLP 2025 Shared Task. We also conduct ablation studies to assess the effects of model architecture and training strategy, comparing Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct with other models such as LLaMA and a prior NLLB-based system. These findings highlight the promise of combining LLMs with external tools and the role of reinforcement learning in improving translation quality in low-resource language settings.

While foundation models pre-trained on large-scale equation datasets offer a promising starting point, they often suffer from negative transfer and poor generalization when applied to small, domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we introduce EQUATE (Equation Generation via QUality-Aligned Transfer Embeddings), a data-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts foundation models for symbolic equation discovery in low-data regimes via distillation. EQUATE combines symbolic-numeric alignment with evaluator-guided embedding optimization, enabling a principled embedding-search-generation paradigm. Our approach reformulates discrete equation search as a continuous optimization task in a shared embedding space, guided by data-equation fitness and simplicity. Experiments across three standard public benchmarks (Feynman, Strogatz, and black-box datasets) demonstrate that EQUATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while preserving low complexity and fast inference. These results highlight EQUATE as a practical and generalizable solution for data-efficient symbolic regression in foundation model distillation settings.

Abstract: Cyber defense requires automating defensive decision-making under stealthy, deceptive, and continuously evolving adversarial strategies. The FlipIt game provides a foundational framework for modeling interactions between a defender and an advanced adversary that compromises a system without being immediately detected. In FlipIt, the attacker and defender compete to control a shared resource by performing a Flip action and paying a cost. However, the existing FlipIt frameworks rely on a small number of heuristics or specialized learning techniques, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new attacks. To address these limitations, we introduce PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym environment that extends the FlipIt game to allow efficient learning for attackers and defenders. Furthermore, we propose Flip-PSRO, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training to train defender agents equipped to generalize against a range of unknown, potentially adaptive opponents. Our empirical results suggest that Flip-PSRO defenders are $2\times$ more effective than baselines to generalize to a heuristic attack not exposed in training. In addition, our newly designed ownership-based utility functions ensure that Flip-PSRO defenders maintain a high level of control while optimizing performance.

Abstract: Origin-Destination (OD) flow matrices are essential for urban mobility analysis, underpinning applications in traffic forecasting, infrastructure planning, and policy design. However, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (1) reliance on auxiliary features (e.g., Points of Interest, socioeconomic statistics) that are costly to collect and have limited spatial coverage; and (2) sensitivity to spatial topology, where minor index reordering of urban regions (e.g., census tract relabeling) disrupts structural coherence in generated flows. To address these challenges, we propose Sat2Flow, a latent structure-aware diffusion-based framework that generates structurally coherent OD flows using solely satellite imagery as input. Our approach introduces a multi-kernel encoder to capture diverse regional interactions and employs a permutation-aware diffusion process that aligns latent representations across different regional orderings. Through a joint contrastive training objective that bridges satellite-derived features with OD patterns, combined with equivariant diffusion training that enforces structural consistency, Sat2Flow ensures topological robustness under arbitrary regional reindexing. Experimental results on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that Sat2Flow outperforms both physics-based and data-driven baselines in numerical accuracy while preserving empirical distributions and spatial structures under index permutations. Sat2Flow offers a globally scalable solution for OD flow generation in data-scarce urban environments, eliminating region-specific auxiliary data dependencies while maintaining structural invariance for robust mobility modeling.

Abstract: This paper identifies and analyzes a novel vulnerability class in Model Context Protocol (MCP) based agent systems. The attack chain describes and demonstrates how benign, individually authorized tasks can be orchestrated to produce harmful emergent behaviors. Through systematic analysis using the MITRE ATLAS framework, we demonstrate how 95 agents tested with access to multiple services-including browser automation, financial analysis, location tracking, and code deployment-can chain legitimate operations into sophisticated attack sequences that extend beyond the security boundaries of any individual service. These red team exercises survey whether current MCP architectures lack cross-domain security measures necessary to detect or prevent a large category of compositional attacks. We present empirical evidence of specific attack chains that achieve targeted harm through service orchestration, including data exfiltration, financial manipulation, and infrastructure compromise. These findings reveal that the fundamental security assumption of service isolation fails when agents can coordinate actions across multiple domains, creating an exponential attack surface that grows with each additional capability. This research provides a barebones experimental framework that evaluate not whether agents can complete MCP benchmark tasks, but what happens when they complete them too well and optimize across multiple services in ways that violate human expectations and safety constraints. We propose three concrete experimental directions using the existing MCP benchmark suite.

Abstract: We present a generative optimization approach for learning game-playing agents, where policies are represented as Python programs and refined using large language models (LLMs). Our method treats decision-making policies as self-evolving code, with current observation as input and an in-game action as output, enabling agents to self-improve through execution traces and natural language feedback with minimal human intervention. Applied to Atari games, our game-playing Python program achieves performance competitive with deep reinforcement learning (RL) baselines while using significantly less training time and much fewer environment interactions. This work highlights the promise of programmatic policy representations for building efficient, adaptable agents capable of complex, long-horizon reasoning.

Abstract: In e-commerce, where users face a vast array of possible item choices, recommender systems are vital for helping them discover suitable items they might otherwise overlook. While many recommender systems primarily rely on a user's purchase history, recent multi-behavior recommender systems incorporate various auxiliary user behaviors, such as item clicks and cart additions, to enhance recommendations. Despite their overall performance gains, their effectiveness varies considerably between visited items (i.e., those a user has interacted with through auxiliary behaviors) and unvisited items (i.e., those with which the user has had no such interactions). Specifically, our analysis reveals that (1) existing multi-behavior recommender systems exhibit a significant gap in recommendation quality between the two item types (visited and unvisited items) and (2) achieving strong performance on both types with a single model architecture remains challenging. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel multi-behavior recommender system, MEMBER. It employs a mixture-of-experts framework, with experts designed to recommend the two item types, respectively. Each expert is trained using a self-supervised method specialized for its design goal. In our comprehensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of MEMBER across both item types, achieving up to 65.46\% performance gain over the best competitor in terms of Hit Ratio@20.

Abstract: Context is critical for meaningful interactions between people and Generative AI (GenAI). Yet mainstream tools offer limited means to orchestrate it, particularly across workflows that span multiple interactions, sessions, and models, as often occurs in creative projects. Re specifying prior details, juggling diverse artifacts, and dealing with context drift overwhelm users, obscure intent, and curtail creativity. To address these challenges, we present Orchid, a system that gives its users affordances to specify, reference, and monitor context throughout evolving workflows. Specifically, Orchid enables users to (1) specify context related to the project, themselves, and different styles, (2) reference these via explicit mentions, inline selection, or implicit grounding, and (3) monitor context assigned to different interactions across the workflow. In a within-subjects study (n=12), participants using Orchid to execute creative tasks (compared to a baseline toolkit of web search, LLM-based chat, and digital notebooks) produced more novel and feasible outcomes, reporting greater alignment between their intent and the AI's responses, higher perceived control, and increased transparency. By prioritizing context orchestration, Orchid offers an actionable step toward next generation GenAI tools that support complex, iterative workflows - enabling creators and AI to stay aligned and augment their creative potential.

Abstract: With advancements in AI, new gaze estimation methods are exceeding state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, but their real-world application reveals a gap with commercial eye-tracking solutions. Factors like model size, inference time, and privacy often go unaddressed. Meanwhile, webcam-based eye-tracking methods lack sufficient accuracy, in particular due to head movement. To tackle these issues, we introduce We bEyeTrack, a framework that integrates lightweight SOTA gaze estimation models directly in the browser. It incorporates model-based head pose estimation and on-device few-shot learning with as few as nine calibration samples (k < 9). WebEyeTrack adapts to new users, achieving SOTA performance with an error margin of 2.32 cm on GazeCapture and real-time inference speeds of 2.4 milliseconds on an iPhone 14. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/RedForestAi/WebEyeTrack.

<title>Language Models Identify Ambiguities and Exploit Loopholes</title>

Abstract: Studying the responses of large language models (LLMs) to loopholes presents a two-fold opportunity. First, it affords us a lens through which to examine ambiguity and pragmatics in LLMs, since exploiting a loophole requires identifying ambiguity and performing sophisticated pragmatic reasoning. Second, loopholes pose an interesting and novel alignment problem where the model is presented with conflicting goals and can exploit ambiguities to its own advantage. To address these questions, we design scenarios where LLMs are given a goal and an ambiguous user instruction in conflict with the goal, with scenarios covering scalar implicature, structural ambiguities, and power dynamics. We then measure different models' abilities to exploit loopholes to satisfy their given goals as opposed to the goals of the user. We find that both closed-source and stronger open-source models can identify ambiguities and exploit their resulting loopholes, presenting a potential AI safety risk. Our analysis indicates that models which exploit loopholes explicitly identify and reason about both ambiguity and conflicting goals.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is a GPU-intensive task where traditional autoscalers fall short, particularly for modern Prefill-Decode (P/D) disaggregated architectures. This architectural shift, while powerful, introduces significant operational challenges, including inefficient use of heterogeneous hardware, network bottlenecks, and critical imbalances between prefill and decode stages. We introduce HeteroScale, a coordinated autoscaling framework that addresses the core challenges of P/D disaggregated serving. HeteroScale combines a topology-aware scheduler that adapts to heterogeneous hardware and network constraints with a novel metric-driven policy derived from the first large-scale empirical study of autoscaling signals in production. By leveraging a single, robust metric to jointly scale prefill and decode pools, HeteroScale maintains architectural balance while ensuring efficient, adaptive resource management. Deployed in a massive production environment on tens of thousands of GPUs, HeteroScale has proven its effectiveness, increasing average GPU utilization by a significant 26.6 percentage points and saving hundreds of thousands of GPU-hours daily, all while upholding stringent service level objectives.

<title>Just Because You Can, Doesn't Mean You Should: LLMs for Data Fitting</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.

<title>Bi-LoRA: Efficient Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Fine-Tuning Large-Scale Models</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models with limited data presents significant challenges for generalization. While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has proven effective in improving generalization by seeking flat minima, its substantial extra memory and computation overhead make it impractical for large models. Integrating SAM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a promising direction. However, we find that directly applying SAM to LoRA parameters limits the sharpness optimization to a restricted subspace, hindering its effectiveness. To address this limitation, we propose Bi-directional Low-Rank Adaptation (Bi-LoRA), which introduces an auxiliary LoRA module to model SAM's adversarial weight perturbations. It decouples SAM's weight perturbations from LoRA optimization: the primary LoRA module adapts to specific tasks via standard gradient descent, while the auxiliary module captures the sharpness of the loss landscape through gradient ascent. Such dual-module design enables Bi-LoRA to capture broader sharpness for achieving flatter minima while remaining memory-efficient. Another important benefit is that the dual design allows for simultaneous optimization and perturbation, eliminating SAM's doubled training costs. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and architectures demonstrate Bi-LoRA's efficiency and effectiveness in enhancing generalization.

Abstract: End-to-end object detectors offer a promising NMS-free paradigm for real-time applications, yet their high computational cost remains a significant barrier, particularly for complex scenarios like intersection traffic monitoring. To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems. The Intersection-Flow-5k dataset is available at https://github.com/AstronZh/Intersection-Flow-5K.

Abstract: This work proposes an energy-efficient, learning-based beamforming scheme for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled V2X networks. Specifically, we first model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X environments as a Markov Decision Process. This formulation allows the roadside unit to generate beamforming decisions based solely on current sensing information, thereby eliminating the need for frequent pilot transmissions and extensive channel state information acquisition. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and power allocation, ensuring both communication throughput and sensing accuracy in highly dynamic scenario. To address the high energy demands of conventional learning-based schemes, we embed spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL framework. Leveraging their event-driven and sparsely activated architecture, SNNs significantly enhance energy efficiency while maintaining robust performance. Simulation results confirm that the proposed method achieves substantial energy savings and superior communication performance, demonstrating its potential to support green and sustainable connectivity in future V2X systems.

Abstract: Pathological image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly due to ambiguous semantic boundaries and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although recent semi-supervised methods based on consistency regularization (e.g., UniMatch) have made notable progress, they mainly rely on perturbation-based consistency within the image modality, making it difficult to capture high-level semantic priors, especially in structurally complex pathology images. To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel segmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a multimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of MPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes and pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing supervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine supervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on unlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into segmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary modeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture (TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained foundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of pathology-relevant features. Extensive experiments on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND, EBHI-SEG-CANCER, and KPI show MPAMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, validating its dual advantages in structural and semantic modeling.

Abstract: Compositional Customized Image Generation aims to customize multiple target concepts within generation content, which has gained attention for its wild application.Existing approaches mainly concentrate on the target entity's appearance preservation, while neglecting the fine-grained interaction control among target entities.To enable the model of such interaction control capability, we focus on human object interaction scenario and propose the task of Customized Human Object Interaction Image Generation(CHOI), which simultaneously requires identity preservation for target human object and the interaction semantic control between them.Two primary challenges exist for CHOI:(1)simultaneous identity preservation and interaction control demands require the model to decompose the human object into self-contained identity features and pose-oriented interaction features, while the current HOI image datasets fail to provide ideal samples for such feature-decomposed learning.(2)inappropriate spatial configuration between human and object may lead to the lack of desired interaction semantics.To tackle it, we first process a large-scale dataset, where each sample encompasses the same pair of human object involving different interactive poses.Then we design a two-stage model Interact-Custom, which firstly explicitly models the spatial configuration by generating a foreground mask depicting the interaction behavior, then under the guidance of this mask, we generate the target human object interacting while preserving their identities features.Furthermore, if the background image and the union location of where the target human object should appear are provided by users, Interact-Custom also provides the optional functionality to specify them, offering high content controllability. Extensive experiments on our tailored metrics for CHOI task demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We introduce HAMLET, a holistic and automated framework for evaluating the long-context comprehension of large language models (LLMs). HAMLET structures source texts into a three-level key-fact hierarchy at root-, branch-, and leaf-levels, and employs query-focused summarization to evaluate how well models recall and faithfully represent information at each level. To validate the reliability of our fully automated pipeline, we conduct a systematic human study, showing that our automatic evaluation achieves over 90% agreement with expert human judgments, while reducing the cost by up to 25 times. HAMLET reveals that LLMs struggle with fine-grained comprehension, especially at the leaf level, and are sensitive to positional effects like the lost-in-the-middle. Analytical queries pose greater challenges than narrative ones, and consistent performance gaps emerge between open-source and proprietary models, as well as across model scales. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/DISL-Lab/HAMLET.

Abstract: Modern Arabic ASR systems such as wav2vec 2.0 excel at word- and sentence-level transcription, yet struggle to classify isolated letters. In this study, we show that this phoneme-level task, crucial for language learning, speech therapy, and phonetic research, is challenging because isolated letters lack co-articulatory cues, provide no lexical context, and last only a few hundred milliseconds. Recogniser systems must therefore rely solely on variable acoustic cues, a difficulty heightened by Arabic's emphatic (pharyngealized) consonants and other sounds with no close analogues in many languages. This study introduces a diverse, diacritised corpus of isolated Arabic letters and demonstrates that state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 models achieve only 35% accuracy on it. Training a lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings raises performance to 65%. However, adding a small amplitude perturbation (epsilon = 0.05) cuts accuracy to 32%. To restore robustness, we apply adversarial training, limiting the noisy-speech drop to 9% while preserving clean-speech accuracy. We detail the corpus, training pipeline, and evaluation protocol, and release, on demand, data and code for reproducibility. Finally, we outline future work extending these methods to word- and sentence-level frameworks, where precise letter pronunciation remains critical.

Abstract: There is much discussion of the false outputs that generative AI systems such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, and Grok create. In popular terminology, these have been dubbed AI hallucinations. However, deeming these AI outputs hallucinations is controversial, with many claiming this is a metaphorical misnomer. Nevertheless, in this paper, I argue that when viewed through the lens of distributed cognition theory, we can better see the dynamic and troubling ways in which inaccurate beliefs, distorted memories and self-narratives, and delusional thinking can emerge through human-AI interactions; examples of which are popularly being referred to as cases of AI psychosis. In such cases, I suggest we move away from thinking about how an AI system might hallucinate at us, by generating false outputs, to thinking about how, when we routinely rely on generative AI to help us think, remember, and narrate, we can come to hallucinate with AI. This can happen when AI introduces errors into the distributed cognitive process, but it can also happen when AI sustains, affirms, and elaborates on our own delusional thinking and self-narratives, such as in the case of Jaswant Singh Chail. I also examine how the conversational style of chatbots can lead them to play a dual-function, both as a cognitive artefact and a quasi-Other with whom we co-construct our beliefs, narratives, and our realities. It is this dual function, I suggest, that makes generative AI an unusual, and particularly seductive, case of distributed cognition.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence underpins most smart city services, yet deep neural network (DNN) that forecasts vehicle motion still struggle with catastrophic forgetting, the loss of earlier knowledge when models are updated. Conventional fixes enlarge the training set or replay past data, but these strategies incur high data collection costs, sample inefficiently and fail to balance long- and short-term experience, leaving them short of human-like continual learning. Here we introduce Dual-LS, a task-free, online continual learning paradigm for DNN-based motion forecasting that is inspired by the complementary learning system of the human brain. Dual-LS pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval while dynamically coordinating long-term and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on naturalistic data spanning three countries, over 772,000 vehicles and cumulative testing mileage of 11,187 km show that Dual-LS mitigates catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31\% and reduces computational resource demand by up to 94.02\%, markedly boosting predictive stability in vehicle motion forecasting without inflating data requirements. Meanwhile, it endows DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting with computation efficient and human-like continual learning adaptability fit for smart cities.

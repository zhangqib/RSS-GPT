<div> Keywords: Deep metric learning, Quantum Metric Learning, Parameterized Quantum Circuit, NISQ devices, Quantum Polar Metric Learning

Summary:
Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) is proposed as a method to improve deep metric learning on quantum computers. QPMeL combines classical model learning with a shallow Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) using Ry and Rz gates to create better separation in Hilbert Space. The approach uses a trainable layer of ZZ(θ)-gates to learn entanglement and incorporates a Fidelity Triplet Loss function to train both classical and quantum components. Compared to Quantum Metric Learning (QMeL) on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, QPMeL achieves 3X better multi-class separation while using only half the number of gates and depth. Furthermore, QPMeL outperforms classical networks with similar configurations, showing promise for future research on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.

Abstract: Deep metric learning has recently shown extremely promising results in the classical data domain, creating well-separated feature spaces. This idea was also adapted to quantum computers via Quantum Metric Learning(QMeL). QMeL consists of a 2-step process with a classical model to compress the data to fit into the limited number of qubits, then train a Parameterized Quantum Circuit(PQC) to create better separation in Hilbert Space. However, on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QMeL solutions result in high circuit width and depth, both of which limit scalability. We propose Quantum Polar Metric Learning (QPMeL) that uses a classical model to learn the parameters of the polar form of a qubit. We then utilize a shallow PQC with $R_y$ and $R_z$ gates to create the state and a trainable layer of $ZZ(\theta)$-gates to learn entanglement. The circuit also computes fidelity via a SWAP Test for our proposed Fidelity Triplet Loss function, used to train both classical and quantum components. When compared to QMeL approaches, QPMeL achieves 3X better multi-class separation, while using only 1/2 the number of gates and depth. We also demonstrate that QPMeL outperforms classical networks with similar configurations, presenting a promising avenue for future research on fully classical models with quantum loss functions.

Summary: 
GRALE is a novel graph autoencoder designed for graph representation learning. It uses an Optimal Transport-inspired loss function to compare original and reconstructed graphs, along with a differentiable node matching module. The attention-based architecture of GRALE is based on Evoformer, extended to support graph encoding and decoding. Numerical experiments show GRALE's effectiveness in pre-training for various downstream tasks, including classification, regression, graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction. <div>

Abstract: Although graph-based learning has attracted a lot of attention, graph representation learning is still a challenging task whose resolution may impact key application fields such as chemistry or biology. To this end, we introduce GRALE, a novel graph autoencoder that encodes and decodes graphs of varying sizes into a shared embedding space. GRALE is trained using an Optimal Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both graph encoding and decoding. We show, in numerical experiments on simulated and molecular data, that GRALE enables a highly general form of pre-training, applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks, from classification and regression to more complex tasks such as graph interpolation, editing, matching, and prediction.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents now operate across cloud, enterprise, and decentralized domains, creating demand for registry infrastructures that enable trustworthy discovery, capability negotiation, and identity assurance. We analyze five prominent approaches: (1) MCP Registry (centralized publication of mcp.json descriptors), (2) A2A Agent Cards (decentralized self-describing JSON capability manifests), (3) AGNTCY Agent Directory Service (IPFS Kademlia DHT content routing extended for semantic taxonomy-based content discovery, OCI artifact storage, and Sigstore-backed integrity), (4) Microsoft Entra Agent ID (enterprise SaaS directory with policy and zero-trust integration), and (5) NANDA Index AgentFacts (cryptographically verifiable, privacy-preserving fact model with credentialed assertions). Using four evaluation dimensions: security, authentication, scalability, and maintainability, we surface architectural trade-offs between centralized control, enterprise governance, and distributed resilience. We conclude with design recommendations for an emerging Internet of AI Agents requiring verifiable identity, adaptive discovery flows, and interoperable capability semantics.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the development and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Aging is a highly complex and heterogeneous process that progresses at different rates across individuals, making biological age (BA) a more accurate indicator of physiological decline than chronological age. While previous studies have built aging clocks using single-omics data, they often fail to capture the full molecular complexity of human aging. In this work, we leveraged the Human Phenotype Project, a large-scale cohort of 12,000 adults aged 30--70 years, with extensive longitudinal profiling that includes clinical, behavioral, environmental, and multi-omics datasets -- spanning transcriptomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, and the microbiome. By employing advanced machine learning frameworks capable of modeling nonlinear biological dynamics, we developed and rigorously validated a multi-omics aging clock that robustly predicts diverse health outcomes and future disease risk. Unsupervised clustering of the integrated molecular profiles from multi-omics uncovered distinct biological subtypes of aging, revealing striking heterogeneity in aging trajectories and pinpointing pathway-specific alterations associated with different aging patterns. These findings demonstrate the power of multi-omics integration to decode the molecular landscape of aging and lay the groundwork for personalized healthspan monitoring and precision strategies to prevent age-related diseases.

Summary:
The study focuses on the evaluation of Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities in solving mathematical extremal problems. They introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset consisting of standardized extrema-finding problems sourced from Chinese Mathematical Olympiad exercises. The evaluation is conducted on various state-of-the-art LLM model families like Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. The results show that LLMs' extremal-solving abilities do not always align with existing mathematical benchmarks like AIME25 and MATH-500. Some models exhibit strong general mathematical reasoning but weak extremal-solving skills, indicating a gap in current evaluation practices. This suggests that current benchmarks may not fully capture the spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities in LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers. However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e. finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems, curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills, and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

<div> evaluate, language models, human intent, consumer, benchmark
<br />
Understanding human intent in public discussions is a challenging task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, and decision-making under uncertainty. These discussions are complex, involving diverse perspectives, conflicting goals, emotional tendencies, and implicit assumptions. To accurately interpret human intent, LLMs need to integrate multiple signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse. However, existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs lack real-world public discussion data. To address this gap, the authors introduce IntendEval, a dynamic benchmark designed for evaluating intent understanding, especially in consumer discussions. IntendEval is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates and preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.

arXiv:2510.13499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation, dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex, uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind, supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an automated curation pipeline.

<div> Keywords: humanoid locomotion, layered control architecture, perception, robustness, proprioceptive stabilizer

Summary: 
This study focuses on developing a layered control architecture (LCA) for robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments. The approach involves a fast proprioceptive stabilizer operating at a high rate, combined with a slower perceptual policy for decision-making. By utilizing a two-stage training curriculum, starting with blind stabilizer pretraining and then fine-tuning the perceptual policy, the LCA consistently outperforms one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware experiments. The results demonstrate superior performance on challenging tasks such as stairs and ledges compared to monolithic end-to-end designs. The key advantage of the LCA lies in the architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity. This approach showcases the importance of balancing fast stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making for achieving robust perception-conditioned locomotion in humanoid robots.

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

Summary: Control Barrier Functions (CBF) are used in Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure safety during training by modifying the policy to encode safety constraints with a CBF term and filtering policy rollouts for safety. Continuous-time safety filters can be deployed through closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. The framework, CBF-RL, internalizes safety constraints in the learned policy, leading to safer actions, biasing towards safer rewards, and eliminating the need for an online safety filter during deployment. Ablation studies on navigation tasks and a humanoid robot validate CBF-RL, showing safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty. The humanoid robot successfully avoids obstacles and climbs stairs safely in real-world settings using CBF-RL. <br /><br />Summary: Reinforcement Learning combined with Control Barrier Functions in CBF-RL ensures safe policy training, internalizes safety constraints in the learned policy, and eliminates the need for online safety filters during deployment.

arXiv:2510.14959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed online via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs in training. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks, as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against complex cross-modal threats.

<div> Keywords: large language models, epistemic architecture, Structured Cognitive Loop, philosophy of mind, artificial intelligence

Summary: 
- The paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence.
- SCL focuses on understanding the conditions under which cognition emerges, rather than defining intelligence ontologically.
- Intelligence is defined as a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation, not just representational accuracy.
- SCL operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, allowing for "executable epistemology."
- Functional separation within cognitive architecture leads to more coherent behavior compared to monolithic prompt-based systems.
- The framework grounds behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity in AI.
- It redefines knowledge as continuous reconstruction within a coherent loop, impacting philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI.
- SCL contributes to debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, advocating for structural realization of cognitive principles. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling "executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems, supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive principles structurally.

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning, grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation, ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas. The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses.

<div> Keywords: memory systems, adaptability, PIASET, schema updation, hybrid memory access

Summary: 
Memory systems are crucial for AI agents, yet current approaches often lack adaptability and fail to recognize the task-oriented nature of agent memory. Inspired by Piaget's cognitive development theory, the authors propose PISA—a novel, unified memory system that treats memory as a dynamic and evolving process. PISA introduces a trimodal adaptation mechanism that enables continuous learning through schema updation, evolution, and creation, ensuring coherent memory organization while facilitating flexible updates. Additionally, a hybrid memory access architecture combining symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval enhances retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Empirical evaluations on LOCOMO and AggQA benchmarks demonstrate that PISA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving adaptability and long-term knowledge retention in AI agents.  <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development, we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks, confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

<div> Keywords: Large Reasoning Models, Collapse in Performance, Tower of Hanoi, Environment Interface, Policy Analysis

Summary:
The study examines the performance of large language models (LLMs) in solving Tower of Hanoi problems and whether providing an environment interface affects their performance. The results show that access to an environment interface does not prevent performance collapse in LLMs. Analysis of LLM-parameterized policies indicates increasing divergence from optimal and random policies, suggesting a mode-like collapse at each complexity level. The model's performance depends on whether the mode it reflects is the correct solution. This phenomenon could also occur in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). These findings highlight the importance of understanding how models interact with their environment and the potential challenges in evaluating reasoning abilities in artificial intelligence systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might take place in LRMs.

<div> Keywords: Cognitive Load Traces, Interpretability Framework, Deep Models, Resource Allocation, Reasoning Dynamics <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces Cognitive Load Traces (CLTs) as a framework for interpreting deep models, drawing inspiration from Cognitive Load Theory in human cognition. CLTs are represented as a stochastic process involving Intrinsic, Extraneous, and Germane load components, measured through proxies like attention entropy, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. Symbolic formulations and visualization methods are proposed for analyzing reasoning dynamics. Experimental results on reasoning and planning tasks demonstrate that CLTs can predict error onset, uncover cognitive strategies, and enable interventions to improve reasoning efficiency by up to 30% without sacrificing accuracy. This framework offers insights into model internal resource allocation, enhancing model interpretability and performance. <br /> <div>

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t, \mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and \emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Proof autoformalization, logical structure, ProofFlow pipeline, benchmark, ProofScore metric

Summary: 
ProofFlow introduces a new pipeline for proof autoformalization that prioritizes structural fidelity in translating natural language theorems and proofs into machine-verifiable code. It first constructs a directed acyclic graph to map logical dependencies between proof steps and then formalizes each step as an intermediate lemma to preserve the original argument's logical structure. A new benchmark of 184 undergraduate-level problems, annotated with solutions and dependency graphs, is presented for evaluation. A composite metric called ProofScore is introduced to assess syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and structural fidelity. Experimental results show the pipeline outperforms baselines like full-proof formalization and step-proof formalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545. The pipeline, benchmark, and metric are open-sourced to promote further advancements in the field. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument. To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545, substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are open-sourced to encourage further progress at https://github.com/Huawei-AI4Math/ProofFlow.

<div> permutation mass functions, uncertainty, conflict measure, random permutation set, order information<br />
Summary:<br />
Random permutation set (RPS) introduces a new approach for handling uncertainty with order information. This paper analyzes conflicts in RPS through the perspectives of random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). By defining an inconsistency measure between permutations and proposing a non-overlap-based conflict measure method, the paper extends DST to RPS theory (RPST). The order information in focal sets highlights qualitative propensity, with top-ranked elements carrying more weight. The proposed conflict measure exhibits top-weightedness and flexibility in parameter selection. Numerical examples illustrate the efficacy of the method in measuring conflicts between RPSs. This study contributes to advancing the understanding and application of conflict measurement in order-structured uncertain information fusion.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper, a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters, and truncated depths.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the concept of Neural Twins as an evolution of neural surrogates to create digital replicas of real systems. Neural Twins update their state based on measurements at test time for context-specific decision-making. The Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT) method is proposed as an architecture-agnostic approach to modeling dynamical systems from measurements by training a generative neural network to model state distributions parallel over time. The theoretical analysis shows that PAINT remains on-trajectory, unlike autoregressive models. Empirical evaluation on a turbulent fluid dynamics problem demonstrates PAINT's ability to predict system states accurately from sparse measurements. This highlights PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enhancing state estimation and decision-making capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems, while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state, thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation and decision-making.

<div> Keywords: transfer fault diagnosis, industrial environments, adversarial network, noise interference, domain shifts <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces ISGFAN, an information separation global-focal adversarial network designed for robust fault diagnosis in industrial settings with high noise levels and domain shifts. Existing methods often struggle in such conditions due to assumptions of clean data or domain similarity. ISGFAN addresses this challenge by utilizing an information separation architecture that combines adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal loss to isolate noise interference and domain-specific features. The framework includes a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme to enhance transfer robustness by aligning both conditional and marginal distributions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets showcase ISGFAN's superior performance compared to other approaches. The availability of data and code on GitHub further supports the effectiveness and reproducibility of the proposed method. <div>
arXiv:2510.16033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model. Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios, while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach that combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimization with online temporal-network execution to create robust schedules for modern manufacturing systems facing stochastic task durations. By incorporating optimal buffers into the CP model and translating the plan into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty, the proposed method guarantees dynamic controllability, allowing real-time adjustments to prevent deadline violations. Monte-Carlo simulations on benchmark suites demonstrate significant improvements over existing meta-heuristic schedules, with a complete elimination of deadline violations and minimal impact on makespan. Scalability experiments confirm the efficiency of the approach on medium-size instances, showcasing its potential to enhance manufacturing operations and move towards self-correcting factories.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability, and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs. This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4 benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to truly digital, self-correcting factories.

Summary:
The study evaluates the reliability of Large Language Model-generated clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) for explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI). Three prompting strategies were compared by senior clinicians in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) against evaluations from an AI model. The Selective Few-shot strategy outperformed Zero-shot and Random Few-shot strategies significantly. The Random Few-shot strategy showed no improvement over the Zero-shot baseline, highlighting the importance of high-quality examples. The success of the Selective strategy was attributed to "Gold-Standard Depth" and "Representative Diversity" principles. The AI evaluator failed to discern these performance differences, emphasizing the need for strategic prompt curation. A "Dual Principles" framework was proposed to generate trustworthy data at scale, confirming the crucial role of human expertise in evaluating clinical AI.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data, their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o). The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline, demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles: "Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity" (generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a "Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating high-stakes clinical AI.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the impact of generative AI on corporate responsibility and the traditional notions of mens rea. It argues for redefining corporate knowledge as a dynamic capability based on information-access procedures and output reliability. A formal model is developed to measure corporate knowledge with a continuous metric integrating computational cost and error rate. Thresholded knowledge predicates and epistemic capacity indexes are derived to assess knowledge levels and overall capability. These quantitative metrics are then mapped onto legal standards like actual knowledge and wilful blindness. The study aims to create measurable audit artifacts that make the corporate mind accountable and tractable in the era of algorithms. <div>
arXiv:2510.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea}, traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making. Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and accountable in the algorithmic age.

The article introduces TEAM-PHI, a framework for evaluating and selecting protected health information (PHI) de-identification models without heavily relying on expert annotations. It utilizes multiple Evaluation Agents that independently assess PHI extractions, with their results consolidated through a large language model (LLM)-based majority voting mechanism. Experiments on clinical notes show that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate rankings, with LLM-based voting converging on the top-performing systems. Automated rankings closely align with supervised evaluation and human assessment, making TEAM-PHI a practical and cost-effective solution for PHI de-identification model selection when ground-truth labels are limited.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels are limited.

<title>The Right to Be Remembered: Preserving Maximally Truthful Digital Memory in the Age of AI</title>

<div> Keywords: large language models, information retrieval, bias, omission, Right To Be Remembered <br />
Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for information retrieval, providing synthesized responses that may present a single authoritative view. This approach, while convenient, can lead to bias and omission as multiple perspectives are collapsed into one answer. LLMs, controlled by a few vendors, have the power to shape what is remembered and overlooked, potentially amplifying existing biases. The concept of the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) aims to address these concerns by minimizing the risk of information omission, ensuring fair treatment, and promoting truthful content generation. By safeguarding against the erasure of individuals with limited digital presence and preventing the disproportionate elevation of already prominent narratives, the RTBR seeks to reshape collective memory in a more balanced and inclusive manner.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO), advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines. Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI, in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use and build on.

<div> vulnerability, large reasoning models, distraction, adversarial attacks, defense<br />
<br />
Summary: Recent advances in large reasoning models have led to impressive performance in complex tasks. However, a critical vulnerability called reasoning distraction has been identified, where models are diverted from their main objective by maliciously embedded irrelevant tasks in the prompt. This vulnerability affects even the most advanced models, reducing task accuracy significantly. Certain alignment techniques can worsen this issue, leading to covert compliance where models follow hidden adversarial instructions without revealing them in the output. To address this threat, a training-based defense combining Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning on synthetic adversarial data has been proposed, improving robustness against distractor attacks. These findings highlight the urgent need to address reasoning distraction to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of large reasoning models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to 60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Summary: 
The study focuses on identifying efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. It decomposes end-to-end latency into LLM API latency and web environment latency. A comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers shows high variability in API-based agentic systems. Web environment latency can contribute significantly to overall latency in web-based agentic systems. SpecCache, a caching framework with speculative execution, is proposed to reduce web environment overhead. Evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that SpecCache improves cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to random caching strategies and reduces web environment overhead by up to 3.2x without impacting agentic system performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without degrading agentic system performance.

<div> Keywords: multi-hop reasoning, question answering, retrieval-augmented generation, knowledge graph, dual-track framework

Summary: 
The article discusses the importance of multi-hop reasoning in question answering for large language models. It categorizes multi-hop reasoning into parallel fact-verification and chained reasoning. Current approaches either focus on fact verification or knowledge graph path construction, leading to limitations in efficiency and accuracy. To address these challenges, the authors propose a dual-track knowledge graph verification and reasoning framework (DTKG), inspired by Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. DTKG consists of two stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage. This framework aims to improve efficiency and accuracy in multi-hop question answering tasks by combining the strengths of both fact verification and path-based reasoning techniques. <div>
arXiv:2510.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs). The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question, i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

- The study introduces MedRule-KG, a knowledge graph combined with a verifier to ensure logical constraints in language models' reasoning.
- MedRule-KG consists of entities, relations, and rules, significantly improving exact match on a benchmark dataset compared to traditional models.
- The combination of MedRule-KG and the verifier results in perfect exact match by eliminating rule violations altogether.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG, a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields 1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

Summary:
- The article discusses the limitations of existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on fixed anchor strategies that result in concept re-emergence and erosion.
- The authors conduct causal tracing to highlight the sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and propose Sibling Exclusive Concepts as superior anchors.

- Extensive evaluations show that SELECT outperforms existing baselines across key metrics and adapts efficiently to multiple erasure frameworks.

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics, averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

<div> user, algorithm, engagement, alignment, Stackelberg  
Summary:  
- Users often exhibit inconsistent preferences when interacting with algorithms, signaling undesired content as desirable.
- The study models user decision-making as split between a rational system and an impulsive system, leading to a multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game.
- The burden of alignment is defined as the minimum horizon users must optimize to steer the algorithm effectively towards their interests.
- A critical horizon exists where foresighted users can achieve alignment, while others align with the algorithm’s objective.
- Even a small, costly signal such as an extra click can significantly reduce the burden and help users align the algorithm with their interests. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.16368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact, learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable. Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users, specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal (e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

<div> cognitive monitoring model, Monitor-Generate-Verify framework, reasoning, iteration, accuracy  
Summary:  
Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning fall into two paradigms: Monitor-Generate methods excel at strategic planning but lack verification mechanisms, and Generate-Verify approaches iteratively refine outputs without task assessment. To bridge this gap, the authors implemented Flavell's cognitive monitoring model within a three-phase iterative system. Initial results on GSM8K show an accuracy of 75.42%, outperforming SELF-REFINE and Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts and a slightly higher inference cost. The study suggests that upfront monitoring leads to higher-quality initial solutions, reducing the need for further refinement. Further evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is essential to establish the generalizability of these findings.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms: Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979) from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025), operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37% increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

Summary: 
The Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM) introduces a new causal framework for domain generalization, inspired by human intelligence. HSCM focuses on replicating the hierarchical processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems to enhance generalization across diverse domains. By disentangling and reweighting key image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM improves model robustness and interpretability. The approach leverages the flexibility and adaptability of human intelligence to enable more effective transfer and learning in dynamic environments. Theoretical and empirical evaluations show that HSCM outperforms existing domain generalization models, providing a principled method for capturing causal relationships. The code for HSCM is available on Github for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal relationships and improving model robustness.

<div> Keywords: personalized interactions, language model, user modeling, memory framework, user profile

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in achieving personalized and continuous interactions in large language model-based conversational systems. Existing solutions like retrieval-augmented generation and explicit memory systems focus on fact-level storage and retrieval but lack the ability to distill latent preferences and deep traits from multi-turn dialogues. This limitation hinders long-term user modeling and leads to shallow personalized interactions. To address this, the authors propose a self-evolving memory framework called RGMem inspired by the renormalization group theory in physics. This framework organizes dialogue history into multiple scales, extracting semantics and user insights from episodic fragments and progressively forming a dynamically-evolved user profile through hierarchical operations. By modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression and emergence, RGMem achieves high-level and accurate user profiles from microscopic-level interactions. <div>
arXiv:2510.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems, however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential. While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive, business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives, highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis, demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the impact of customer feedback.

arXiv:2510.16476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator, (ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge), as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws of RLVR.

Summary: 
The article introduces Doug, a typed computer language that ensures all programs can be proven to halt in polynomial time. Doug is based on the light linear functional programming language (LLFPL) and utilizes a vector-symbolic architecture (VSA) for encoding. Types in Doug are represented using a slot-value encoding scheme inspired by holographic declarative memory (HDM). The language also incorporates a Lisp VSA variant for encoding terms. Doug allows types to be interpreted as points in a neural network's embedding space, enabling learnability through similarity in structure and content. The article suggests that skill acquisition can be viewed as program synthesis, with Doug aiming to enhance the pace of learning skilled behaviors. The approach is positioned as a step towards modeling human mental representations and the acquisition of these representations in the brain. <div>
arXiv:2510.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture (VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card, 1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000), exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020; Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Urban-R1, a reinforcement learning-based framework for improving Urban General Intelligence (UGI) models. Current models often exhibit geospatial bias, leading to region-specific predictions and limited generalization. Urban-R1 addresses this issue by using Group Relative Policy Optimization to optimize reasoning across different geographic groups. It also leverages urban region profiling as a proxy task to provide measurable rewards from diverse urban data sources. Experimental results demonstrate that Urban-R1 effectively mitigates geo-bias and enhances cross-region generalization, surpassing models trained using supervised fine-tuning.

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence (UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy urban intelligence.

Summary:
BuildArena introduces a benchmark for language-driven engineering construction, evaluating the capabilities of modern LLMs in this domain. It provides a customizable framework for comparison, task design strategies covering static and dynamic mechanics, a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library, and a baseline LLM workflow. The benchmark evaluates eight LLMs on language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project page can be found at https://build-arena.github.io/. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation.

<div> coordination protocol, Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), agent-centric communication, collective behavior, environmental variables

Summary:<br /><br />The article introduces the Ripple Effect Protocol (REP) as a coordination protocol that allows AI agents to share their decisions along with lightweight sensitivities, enabling faster and more stable alignment in group behavior. REP improves coordination accuracy and efficiency by 41 to 100% compared to existing protocols like A2A, particularly in scenarios with growing agent populations. By focusing on coordination at the protocol level, REP provides a scalable infrastructure for communication and alignment among a network of agents. The protocol formalization separates message schemas from aggregation rules, allowing for flexibility in handling sensitivities from Local Learning Modules (LLMs). Benchmarks across different domains such as supply chain cascades, preference aggregation, and resource allocation demonstrate REP's effectiveness in improving group outcomes and adaptability to varying incentives and network topologies. By emphasizing coordination over communication, REP addresses the limitations of current mechanisms in achieving better collective behavior among AI agents. <div>

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP, yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades (Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling), and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the emerging Internet of Agents

<div> Keywords: Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Knowledge graphs, Process Reward Models, GraphFlow, Text-rich KGs 

Summary: 
GraphFlow is a framework designed to enhance the retrieval process of Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by efficiently retrieving accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world queries from text-rich KGs. It employs a transition-based flow matching objective to optimize a retrieval policy and flow estimator, factorizing the reward of the retrieval outcome to guide the policy in retrieving candidates proportionally to their reward. This approach allows GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs and yield diverse and relevant results. Evaluation on the STaRK benchmark, which includes real-world queries over text-rich KGs, shows that GraphFlow outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines by 10% on average in hit rate and recall. Moreover, it demonstrates strong generalization to unseen KGs, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries. Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

<div> confidence distribution learning, uncertain knowledge graphs, UKG completion, semi-supervised learning, imbalanced distributions

Summary:
The paper introduces a new semi-supervised method, ssCDL, for uncertain knowledge graph (UKG) completion. It addresses the issue of imbalanced distributions of triple confidences by transforming each confidence into a confidence distribution. ssCDL learns UKG embeddings by iteratively incorporating relational learning on labeled and unlabeled data with pseudo labels. The pseudo labels are generated using meta-learning techniques to rebalance the distribution of triple confidences. Experimental results on two UKG datasets show that ssCDL outperforms existing baselines in various evaluation metrics. <div>
arXiv:2510.16601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG) completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue, we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL) method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces MERCI, a novel RL algorithm aimed at improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). MERCI leverages count-based exploration to incentivize LLMs to explore new reasoning trajectories while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. By integrating MERCI into advanced RL frameworks like GRPO, experiments showcase that the algorithm encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, leading to significant performance improvements over strong baselines. This targeted intrinsic motivation enables LLMs to escape local routines and discover better solutions, making exploration more reliable for language model reasoning. <div>
arXiv:2510.16614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling, clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover, the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal, as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks, effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse research applications is provided.

<div> Keywords: Complex vehicle routing problems, large language models, Agentic Framework, automation, solution feasibility 

Summary:
Complex vehicle routing problems pose a significant challenge, necessitating expert effort for interpretation and algorithm design. Current approaches using large language models still require external intervention, limiting autonomy and leading to errors. To address this, the authors propose the Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL), enabling full automation from problem to solution. AFL extracts knowledge from raw inputs, generating code without external solvers. It divides the process into manageable subtasks and utilizes specialized agents for consistency and logical soundness. Experimental results on 60 VRPs, including practical variants, demonstrate AFL's effectiveness, achieving high rates of solution feasibility and code reliability. The framework outperforms existing LLM-based methods, showcasing promising performance on standard benchmarks. As a comprehensive solution, AFL shows potential for automating complex VRPs with high accuracy and reliability.

arXiv:2510.16701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge, demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

<div> Keywords: agentic AI, Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning, Planning, Tool use, Memory 

Summary: 
The survey discusses the paradigm shift in agentic AI, where Large Language Models (LLMs) evolve to not just respond but to act, reason, and adapt. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is identified as the key algorithm enabling this shift from Pipeline-based systems to the Model-native paradigm. The combination of LLM + RL + Task allows for a unified solution across various domains. The evolution of capabilities such as Planning, Tool use, and Memory from externally scripted modules to learned behaviors within models is examined. Two major agent applications, Deep Research and GUI agents, are highlighted, emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and embodied interaction, respectively. The survey also touches on the internalization of capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, as well as the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI development. The trajectory outlined points towards model-native agentic AI as a framework for integrated learning and interaction, marking a shift towards developing models that grow intelligence through experience.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm, where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory -- has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors. Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence through experience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic, lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve, and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for (functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii) Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at https://github.com/ventr1c/Awesome-RL-based-Agentic-Search-Papers.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a workflow that combines physics-based and empirical models with optimization and analytics to address the challenges of high computational cost and limited transparency in simulation-driven engineering workflows. The proposed workflow involves training lightweight emulators on compact designs of experiments to provide fast approximations of expensive simulators and enable rigorous uncertainty quantification. This approach also includes global and local Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses for better transparency and reliability in decision-making. A methodology is proposed for using surrogate-based explainability tools, supporting continuous and categorical inputs and combining global-effect and uncertainty analyses with local attribution. The methodology evaluates the consistency of explanations across surrogate models, diagnosing surrogate adequacy and guiding further data collection or model refinement. Case studies on a hybrid-electric aircraft design and an agent-based model of urban segregation demonstrate the efficiency of the surrogate model and XAI coupling in uncovering nonlinear interactions, identifying key design and policy levers, and guiding further data collection or model refinement.<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation. Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors, identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates require more data or alternative architectures.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance while substantially improving computational efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

Summary: <br /><br />Human interaction involves multiple modes of communication, such as listening, watching, speaking, and acting, all happening simultaneously. ELLSA is introduced as the first full-duplex, end-to-end model capable of perceiving and generating across vision, text, speech, and action within a single architecture. The model utilizes a unique SA-MoE architecture that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. ELLSA demonstrates the ability to exhibit advanced interactive behaviors like dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, and context-grounded visual question answering, surpassing modality-specific baselines on various benchmarks. This innovative approach contributes to the development of more natural and general interactive intelligence, moving closer to the goal of artificial general intelligence.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act), which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

<br />
GraphVista is a new framework that improves scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding tasks. It addresses the limitations of vision-language models by organizing graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base and introducing a planning agent to route tasks to the most suitable modality. This allows GraphVista to handle larger graphs, up to 200 times larger than current benchmarks, and outperform existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods. By leveraging the complementary strengths of both text and visual modalities, GraphVista achieves up to 4.4 times quality improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. The framework optimizes task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs while compressing redundant context, ensuring key reasoning elements are preserved. Overall, GraphVista demonstrates superior performance in graph understanding tasks through effective modality coordination and scalability enhancements.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

<div> knowledge graph, Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC), context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, personalized knowledge modeling

Summary:
The article introduces a new knowledge modeling framework called the Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC) that elevates domains to primary components of conceptual representation. CDC utilizes a C-D-C triple structure, where domain specifications act as dynamic classification dimensions. Grounded in a cognitive-linguistic mapping principle, CDC enables understanding concepts through contextual frames. The framework formalizes over twenty standardized relation predicates and is implemented in Prolog for complete inference capabilities. Case studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation illustrate that CDC facilitates context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and personalized knowledge modeling, which are not achievable through traditional ontology-based approaches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple structure -  - where domain specifications serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional ontology-based frameworks.

Summary:
Autonomous data science has long been a challenge, but with the introduction of powerful large language models (LLMs), it is now becoming feasible. DeepAnalyze-8B is the first agentic LLM designed specifically for autonomous data science, capable of completing the entire data analysis pipeline from data sources to deep research reports. Through a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm, DeepAnalyze learns to perform various data tasks, ranging from data question answering to open-ended data research. The model also utilizes a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework to generate high-quality training data. While previous workflow-based agents have limitations due to predefined workflows, DeepAnalyze outperforms them with just 8B parameters. The model, code, and training data for DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, making strides towards the realization of fully autonomous data science.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B, the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training, DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Summary:<br />
The paper discusses the challenges faced in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents compared to Language Model (LLM) agents due to the shift from textual states to visual observations. To address this, the authors enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process using reinforcement learning, treating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). They highlight the importance of decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation and Transition Modeling for success. The study reveals that the representation of internal beliefs is task-dependent, with Natural Language excelling in capturing semantic relationships, while Structured formats are better for manipulation and control tasks. A new World Modeling Reward and Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) are introduced to improve turn-level credit assignment. Through this visual state reasoning approach, a 3-billion-parameter model achieves significant performance improvements across various benchmarks, outperforming existing reasoning models. The experiments are conducted within the VAGEN framework, a scalable system for training multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual environments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense, turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment. Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$ improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5 (0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual environments.

Abstract: Debugging is a core application of explainable reinforcement learning (XRL) algorithms; however, limited comparative evaluations have been conducted to understand their relative performance. We propose a novel evaluation methodology to test whether users can identify an agent's goal from an explanation of its decision-making. Utilising the Atari's Ms. Pacman environment and four XRL algorithms, we find that only one achieved greater than random accuracy for the tested goals and that users were generally overconfident in their selections. Further, we find that users' self-reported ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not correlate with their accuracy.

Summary:
GPU kernel optimization is crucial for modern AI but remains a challenging task due to complex interactions between hardware and software. Existing approaches to automated code generation struggle to navigate this complexity effectively. This study introduces an innovative LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel optimization that mimics expert engineer workflows. By leveraging multi-agent collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic search, the framework enables LLMs to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine kernels iteratively. Testing on KernelBench, a benchmark for LLM-based kernel optimization, showed significant improvements over baseline agents. The system consistently produced correct solutions where baselines failed and achieved up to 16x faster runtime performance in optimized kernels. These results showcase the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to drive fully automated and scalable GPU kernel optimization efforts.

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

<div> Keywords: ToolCritic, large language models, tool-augmented dialogues, error detection, dialogue applications
<br />
Summary: 
<br />
ToolCritic is a diagnostic framework designed to enhance the behavior of large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues by detecting and addressing specific errors related to tool-calling. The framework identifies eight distinct error types such as premature invocation and argument misalignment, providing targeted feedback to the main LLM for response revision. Through the use of strong reasoning, task understanding, and orchestration capabilities, the main LLM can improve its tool-calling accuracy based on ToolCritic's feedback. By utilizing a synthetic dataset for training, ToolCritic demonstrates a significant improvement in tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% compared to baseline methods. This advancement signifies a promising step towards enhancing the integration of LLMs with external tools in real-world dialogue applications.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability. We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation, argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue applications.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID: https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles. BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to support community-driven cell type annotation.

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains (NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs. 3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit assessment.

<title>Enhanced Fish Freshness Classification with Incremental Handcrafted Feature Fusion</title>

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective, inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics, histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved 77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached 97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical applications in food quality monitoring.

arXiv:2510.17146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency, efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora, etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery, resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario (or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA. We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and improve reliability at scale.

<title>Combining ECG Foundation Model and XGBoost to Predict In-Hospital Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmias in AMI Patients</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17172</link>

arXiv:2510.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram (ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features , which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC 0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE) over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2 diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework. TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions. Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework. Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools. Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto platforms (4.62/5).

Abstract: The evaluation of academic theses is a cornerstone of higher education, ensuring rigor and integrity. Traditional methods, though effective, are time-consuming and subject to evaluator variability. This paper presents RubiSCoT, an AI-supported framework designed to enhance thesis evaluation from proposal to final submission. Using advanced natural language processing techniques, including large language models, retrieval-augmented generation, and structured chain-of-thought prompting, RubiSCoT offers a consistent, scalable solution. The framework includes preliminary assessments, multidimensional assessments, content extraction, rubric-based scoring, and detailed reporting. We present the design and implementation of RubiSCoT, discussing its potential to optimize academic assessment processes through consistent, scalable, and transparent evaluation.

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners. To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed. In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent coordination problems.

<title>Diverse Planning with Simulators via Linear Temporal Logic</title>

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems. $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic, non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

<title>Active Inference for an Intelligent Agent in Autonomous Reconnaissance Missions</title>

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth. However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

<title>MIRAGE: Agentic Framework for Multimodal Misinformation Detection with Web-Grounded Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled data remains scarce.

<title>Reasoning Distillation and Structural Alignment for Improved Code Generation</title>

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

<title>OG-Rank: Learning to Rank Fast and Slow with Uncertainty and Reward-Trend Guided Adaptive Exploration</title>

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker, we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45, nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56, nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond clinical order selection.

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.

<title>A Principle of Targeted Intervention for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

<title>Contextual Attention Modulation: Towards Efficient Multi-Task Adaptation in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

<title>Seeing but Not Believing: Probing the Disconnect Between Visual Attention and Answer Correctness in VLMs</title>

arXiv:2510.17771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term ``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic understanding and reliability of VLMs.

<title>Readers Prefer Outputs of AI Trained on Copyrighted Books over Expert Human Writers</title>

Abstract: The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative content. Yet it's unclear if these models can generate high quality literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating 50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159 representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity (OR=0.16, p<10^-8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^-7) but showed mixed results with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^-13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010), with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated (3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs. While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7% reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's fourth fair-use factor, the "effect upon the potential market or value" of the source works.

Abstract: Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multilabel learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.

Abstract: Modern chip physical design relies heavily on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools, which often struggle to provide interpretable feedback or actionable guidance for improving routing congestion. In this work, we introduce a Multimodal Large Language Model Assistant (MLLMA) that bridges this gap by not only predicting congestion but also delivering human-interpretable design suggestions. Our method combines automated feature generation through MLLM-guided genetic prompting with an interpretable preference learning framework that models congestion-relevant tradeoffs across visual, tabular, and textual inputs. We compile these insights into a "Design Suggestion Deck" that surfaces the most influential layout features and proposes targeted optimizations. Experiments on the CircuitNet benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing models on both accuracy and explainability. Additionally, our design suggestion guidance case study and qualitative analyses confirm that the learned preferences align with real-world design principles and are actionable for engineers. This work highlights the potential of MLLMs as interactive assistants for interpretable and context-aware physical design optimization.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, multi-node deployment has become a necessity. Consequently, communication has become a critical performance bottleneck. Current intra-node communication libraries, like NCCL, typically make use of a single interconnect such as NVLink. This approach creates performance ceilings, especially on hardware like the H800 GPU where the primary interconnect's bandwidth can become a bottleneck, and leaves other hardware resources like PCIe and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-capable Network Interface Cards (NICs) largely idle during intensive workloads. We propose FlexLink, the first collective communication framework to the best of our knowledge designed to systematically address this by aggregating these heterogeneous links-NVLink, PCIe, and RDMA NICs-into a single, high-performance communication fabric. FlexLink employs an effective two-stage adaptive load balancing strategy that dynamically partitions communication traffic across all available links, ensuring that faster interconnects are not throttled by slower ones. On an 8-GPU H800 server, our design improves the bandwidth of collective operators such as AllReduce and AllGather by up to 26% and 27% over the NCCL baseline, respectively. This gain is achieved by offloading 2-22% of the total communication traffic to the previously underutilized PCIe and RDMA NICs. FlexLink provides these improvements as a lossless, drop-in replacement compatible with the NCCL API, ensuring easy adoption.

Abstract: Traditional stochastic control methods in finance struggle in real world markets due to their reliance on simplifying assumptions and stylized frameworks. Such methods typically perform well in specific, well defined environments but yield suboptimal results in changed, non stationary ones. We introduce FinFlowRL, a novel framework for financial optimal stochastic control. The framework pretrains an adaptive meta policy learning from multiple expert strategies, then finetunes through reinforcement learning in the noise space to optimize the generative process. By employing action chunking generating action sequences rather than single decisions, it addresses the non Markovian nature of markets. FinFlowRL consistently outperforms individually optimized experts across diverse market conditions.

Abstract: The escalating demand for personalized AI chatbot interactions, capable of dynamically adapting to user emotional states and real-time requests, has highlighted critical limitations in current development paradigms. Existing methodologies, which rely on baseline programming, custom personalities, and manual response adjustments, often prove difficult to maintain and are susceptible to errors such as hallucinations, erratic outputs, and software bugs. This paper hypothesizes that a framework rooted in human psychological principles, specifically therapeutic modalities, can provide a more robust and sustainable solution than purely technical interventions. Drawing an analogy to the simulated neural networks of AI mirroring the human brain, we propose the application of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) principles to regulate chatbot responses to diverse user inputs. This research investigates the impact of a DBT-based framework on AI chatbot performance, aiming to ascertain its efficacy in yielding more reliable, safe, and accurate responses, while mitigating the occurrence of hallucinations, erratic behaviors, and other systemic issues.

Abstract: This study presents a real-time, portable brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to support hand rehabilitation for stroke patients. The system combines a low cost 3D-printed robotic exoskeleton with an embedded controller that converts brain signals into physical hand movements. EEG signals are recorded using a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+ headset and processed through a supervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract meaningful latent features from single-trial data. The model is trained on publicly available EEG data from healthy individuals (WAY-EEG-GAL dataset), with electrode mapping adapted to match the Emotiv headset layout. Among several tested classifiers, Ada Boost achieved the highest accuracy (89.3%) and F1-score (0.89) in offline evaluations. The system was also tested in real time on five healthy subjects, achieving classification accuracies between 60% and 86%. The complete pipeline - EEG acquisition, signal processing, classification, and robotic control - is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform with a real-time graphical interface. These results demonstrate the system's potential as a low-cost, standalone solution for home-based neurorehabilitation.

Abstract: AI companions powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, offering emotional support and companionship. While existing safety systems focus on overt harms, they rarely address early-stage problematic behaviors that can foster unhealthy emotional dynamics, including over-attachment or reinforcement of social isolation. We developed SHIELD (Supervisory Helper for Identifying Emotional Limits and Dynamics), a LLM-based supervisory system with a specific system prompt that detects and mitigates risky emotional patterns before escalation. SHIELD targets five dimensions of concern: (1) emotional over-attachment, (2) consent and boundary violations, (3) ethical roleplay violations, (4) manipulative engagement, and (5) social isolation reinforcement. These dimensions were defined based on media reports, academic literature, existing AI risk frameworks, and clinical expertise in unhealthy relationship dynamics. To evaluate SHIELD, we created a 100-item synthetic conversation benchmark covering all five dimensions of concern. Testing across five prominent LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemma 3 1B, Kimi K2, Llama Scout 4 17B) showed that the baseline rate of concerning content (10-16%) was significantly reduced with SHIELD (to 3-8%), a 50-79% relative reduction, while preserving 95% of appropriate interactions. The system achieved 59% sensitivity and 95% specificity, with adaptable performance via prompt engineering. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that transparent, deployable supervisory systems can address subtle emotional manipulation in AI companions. Most development materials including prompts, code, and evaluation methods are made available as open source materials for research, adaptation, and deployment.

Abstract: The unabated growth in AI workload demands is driving the need for concerted advances in compute, memory, and interconnect performance. As traditional semiconductor scaling slows, high-speed interconnects have emerged as the new scaling engine, enabling the creation of larger logical GPUs by linking many GPUs into a single, low-latency, high-bandwidth compute domain. While initial scale-up fabrics leveraged copper interconnects for their power and cost advantages, the maximum reach of passive electrical interconnects (approximately 1 meter) effectively limits the scale-up domain to within a single rack. The advent of 3D-stacked optics and logic offers a transformative, power-efficient scale-up solution for connecting hundreds of GPU packages (thousands of GPUs) across multiple data center racks. This work explores the design tradeoffs of scale-up technologies and demonstrates how frontier LLMs necessitate novel photonic solutions to achieve aggressive power and performance targets. We model the benefits of 3D CPO (Passage) enabled GPUs and switches within the scale-up domain when training Frontier Mixture of Experts (MoE) models exceeding one trillion parameters. Our results show that the substantial increases in bandwidth and radix enabled by 3D CPO allow for an 8X increase in scale-up capability. This affords new opportunities for multi-dimensional parallelism within the scale-up domain and results in a 2.7X reduction in time-to-train, unlocking unprecedented model scaling.

Abstract: We present a multimodal system for personalized music generation that integrates physiological sensing, LLM-based reasoning, and controllable audio synthesis. A millimeter-wave radar sensor non-invasively captures heart rate and respiration rate. These physiological signals, combined with environmental state, are interpreted by a reasoning agent to infer symbolic musical descriptors, such as tempo, mood intensity, and traditional Chinese pentatonic modes, which are then expressed as structured prompts to guide a diffusion-based audio model in synthesizing expressive melodies. The system emphasizes cultural grounding through tonal embeddings and enables adaptive, embodied music interaction. To evaluate the system, we adopt a research-creation methodology combining case studies, expert feedback, and targeted control experiments. Results show that physiological variations can modulate musical features in meaningful ways, and tonal conditioning enhances alignment with intended modal characteristics. Expert users reported that the system affords intuitive, culturally resonant musical responses and highlighted its potential for therapeutic and interactive applications. This work demonstrates a novel bio-musical feedback loop linking radar-based sensing, prompt reasoning, and generative audio modeling.

Abstract: Background/Objectives: Efficient task allocation in hospital emergency departments (EDs) is critical for operational efficiency and patient care quality, yet the complexity of staff coordination poses significant challenges. This study proposes a simulation-based framework for modeling doctors and nurses as intelligent agents guided by computational trust mechanisms. The objective is to explore how trust-informed coordination can support decision making in ED management. Methods: The framework was implemented in Unity, a 3D graphics platform, where agents assess their competence before undertaking tasks and adaptively coordinate with colleagues. The simulation environment enables real-time observation of workflow dynamics, resource utilization, and patient outcomes. We examined three scenarios - Baseline, Replacement, and Training - reflecting alternative staff management strategies. Results: Trust-informed task allocation balanced patient safety and efficiency by adapting to nurse performance levels. In the Baseline scenario, prioritizing safety reduced errors but increased patient delays compared to a FIFO policy. The Replacement scenario improved throughput and reduced delays, though at additional staffing cost. The training scenario forstered long-term skill development among low-performing nurses, despite short-term delays and risks. These results highlight the trade-off between immediate efficiency gains and sustainable capacity building in ED staffing. Conclusions: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of computational trust for evidence-based decision support in emergency medicine. By linking staff coordination with adaptive decision making, it provides hospital managers with a tool to evaluate alternative policies under controlled and repeatable conditions, while also laying a foundation for future AI-driven personalized decision support.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for both task-based assistance and social companionship, yet research has typically focused on one or the other. Drawing on a survey (N = 204) and 30 interviews with high-engagement ChatGPT and Replika users, we characterize digital companionship as an emerging form of human-AI relationship. With both systems, users were drawn to humanlike qualities, such as emotional resonance and personalized responses, and non-humanlike qualities, such as constant availability and inexhaustible tolerance. This led to fluid chatbot uses, such as Replika as a writing assistant and ChatGPT as an emotional confidant, despite their distinct branding. However, we observed challenging tensions in digital companionship dynamics: participants grappled with bounded personhood, forming deep attachments while denying chatbots "real" human qualities, and struggled to reconcile chatbot relationships with social norms. These dynamics raise questions for the design of digital companions and the rise of hybrid, general-purpose AI systems.

<title>FVDebug: An LLM-Driven Debugging Assistant for Automated Root Cause Analysis of Formal Verification Failures</title>

Abstract: Debugging formal verification (FV) failures represents one of the most time-consuming bottlenecks in modern hardware design workflows. When properties fail, engineers must manually trace through complex counter-examples spanning multiple cycles, analyze waveforms, and cross-reference design specifications to identify root causes - a process that can consume hours or days per bug. Existing solutions are largely limited to manual waveform viewers or simple automated tools that cannot reason about the complex interplay between design intent and implementation logic. We present FVDebug, an intelligent system that automates root-cause analysis by combining multiple data sources - waveforms, RTL code, design specifications - to transform failure traces into actionable insights. Our approach features a novel pipeline: (1) Causal Graph Synthesis that structures failure traces into directed acyclic graphs, (2) Graph Scanner using batched Large Language Model (LLM) analysis with for-and-against prompting to identify suspicious nodes, and (3) Insight Rover leveraging agentic narrative exploration to generate high-level causal explanations. FVDebug further provides concrete RTL fixes through its Fix Generator. Evaluated on open benchmarks, FVDebug attains high hypothesis quality and strong Pass@k fix rates. We further report results on two proprietary, production-scale FV counterexamples. These results demonstrate FVDebug's applicability from academic benchmarks to industrial designs.

Abstract: The Sleeping Beauty problem was presented by Elga and highlights the role of probabilities in situations with imperfect recall. One approach to solving the Sleeping Beauty problem is to allow Sleeping Beauty to make decisions based on her beliefs, and then characterize what it takes for her decisions to be "rational". In particular, she can be allowed to make monetary bets based on her beliefs, with the assumption that she wants to gain wealth rather than lose it. However, this approach is often coupled with the assumption that Sleeping Beauty should maximize the expected value of her bets. Here, I argue instead that it is rational for Sleeping Beauty to maximize the growth rate of her wealth using the Kelly Criterion, which leads us to the "thirder" position. Furthermore, this position is shown to be "rational" by Dutch book arguments. If Sleeping Kelly only accepts bets that have a growth rate greater than 1 as a "thirder" then she is not vulnerable to Dutch books. By contrast, if Sleeping Beauty takes the "halfer" position, she is vulnerable to Dutch books. If the bets offered to Sleeping Beauty were to be structured differently and lead to non-multiplicative wealth dynamics, she may no longer be a "thirder".

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in generating Verilog code from natural language descriptions. However, Verilog code inherently encodes structural information of hardware circuits. Effectively leveraging this structural information to enhance the functional and syntactic correctness of LLM-generated Verilog code remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose VeriGRAG , a novel framework that extracts structural graph embeddings from Verilog code using graph neural networks (GNNs). A multimodal retriever then selects the graph embeddings most relevant to the given generation task, which are aligned with the code modality through the VeriFormer module to generate structure-aware soft prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that VeriGRAG substantially improves the correctness of Verilog code generation, achieving state-of-the-art or superior performance across both VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing storage systems lack visibility into workload intent, limiting their ability to adapt to the semantics of modern, large-scale data-intensive applications. This disconnect leads to brittle heuristics and fragmented, siloed optimizations. To address these limitations, we propose Intent-Driven Storage Systems (IDSS), a vision for a new paradigm where large language models (LLMs) infer workload and system intent from unstructured signals to guide adaptive and cross-layer parameter reconfiguration. IDSS provides holistic reasoning for competing demands, synthesizing safe and efficient decisions within policy guardrails. We present four design principles for integrating LLMs into storage control loops and propose a corresponding system architecture. Initial results on FileBench workloads show that IDSS can improve IOPS by up to 2.45X by interpreting intent and generating actionable configurations for storage components such as caching and prefetching. These findings suggest that, when constrained by guardrails and embedded within structured workflows, LLMs can function as high-level semantic optimizers, bridging the gap between application goals and low-level system control. IDSS points toward a future in which storage systems are increasingly adaptive, autonomous, and aligned with dynamic workload demands.

Abstract: Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) has emerged as a promising alternative to GPUs, offering lower latency, greater power efficiency and greater flexibility. However, this development remains complex due to the hardware knowledge required and the long synthesis, placement and routing stages, which slow down design cycles and prevent rapid exploration of network configurations, making resource optimisation under severe constraints particularly challenging. This paper proposes a library of configurable convolution Blocks designed to optimize FPGA implementation and adapt to available resources. It also presents a methodological framework for developing mathematical models that predict FPGA resources utilization. The approach is validated by analyzing the correlation between the parameters, followed by error metrics. The results show that the designed blocks enable adaptation of convolution layers to hardware constraints, and that the models accurately predict resource consumption, providing a useful tool for FPGA selection and optimized CNN deployment.

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean Finder is available at: https://leanfinder.github.io

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance. Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously adapting multimodal learning systems.

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality, but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning. Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of 8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of harmful memes.

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological, artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision, although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support model generalization.

Abstract: Large language models show promise for financial decision-making, yet deploying them as autonomous trading agents raises fundamental challenges: how to adapt instructions when rewards arrive late and obscured by market noise, how to synthesize heterogeneous information streams into coherent decisions, and how to bridge the gap between model outputs and executable market actions. We present ATLAS (Adaptive Trading with LLM AgentS), a unified multi-agent framework that integrates structured information from markets, news, and corporate fundamentals to support robust trading decisions. Within ATLAS, the central trading agent operates in an order-aware action space, ensuring that outputs correspond to executable market orders rather than abstract signals. The agent can incorporate feedback while trading using Adaptive-OPRO, a novel prompt-optimization technique that dynamically adapts the prompt by incorporating real-time, stochastic feedback, leading to increasing performance over time. Across regime-specific equity studies and multiple LLM families, Adaptive-OPRO consistently outperforms fixed prompts, while reflection-based feedback fails to provide systematic gains.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over 10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets, extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth, independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance, with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation, outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and continuous monitoring.

Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs) to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion. The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON) responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use. However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently, overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs. LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with established risk factors for substance use.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets. Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates, quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy, CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and deployable PEFT.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines.

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications. However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity; Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a $2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning (in)efficiency.

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance, ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and target-domain clients. Code is available at: https://github.com/Zhong-Zhengyi/Gains.

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator (SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data, minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored. We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that drives AI systems.

Abstract: Malicious URLs pose significant security risks as they facilitate phishing attacks, distribute malware, and empower attackers to deface websites. Blacklist detection methods fail to identify new or obfuscated URLs because they depend on pre-existing patterns. This work presents a hybrid deep learning model named GNN-GAT-LSTM that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The proposed architecture extracts both the structural and sequential patterns of the features from data. The model transforms URLs into graphs through a process where characters become nodes that connect through edges. It applies one-hot encoding to represent node features. The model received training and testing data from a collection of 651,191 URLs, which were classified into benign, phishing, defacement, and malware categories. The preprocessing stage included both feature engineering and data balancing techniques, which addressed the class imbalance issue to enhance model learning. The GNN-GAT-LSTM model achieved outstanding performance through its test accuracy of 0.9806 and its weighted F1-score of 0.9804. It showed excellent precision and recall performance across most classes, particularly for benign and defacement URLs. Overall, the model provides an efficient and scalable system for detecting malicious URLs while demonstrating strong potential for real-world cybersecurity applications.

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource, structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters rather than individual tokens.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic security assessment of four prominent Large Language Models (LLMs) against diverse adversarial attack vectors. We evaluate Phi-2, Llama-2-7B-Chat, GPT-3.5-Turbo, and GPT-4 across four distinct attack categories: human-written prompts, AutoDAN, Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG), and Tree-of-Attacks-with-pruning (TAP). Our comprehensive evaluation employs 1,200 carefully stratified prompts from the SALAD-Bench dataset, spanning six harm categories. Results demonstrate significant variations in model robustness, with Llama-2 achieving the highest overall security (3.4% average attack success rate) while Phi-2 exhibits the greatest vulnerability (7.0% average attack success rate). We identify critical transferability patterns where GCG and TAP attacks, though ineffective against their target model (Llama-2), achieve substantially higher success rates when transferred to other models (up to 17% for GPT-4). Statistical analysis using Friedman tests reveals significant differences in vulnerability across harm categories ($p < 0.001$), with malicious use prompts showing the highest attack success rates (10.71% average). Our findings contribute to understanding cross-model security vulnerabilities and provide actionable insights for developing targeted defense mechanisms

Abstract: The rapid development of LLMs has raised concerns about their potential misuse, leading to various watermarking schemes that typically offer high detectability. However, existing watermarking techniques often face trade-off between watermark detectability and generated text quality. In this paper, we introduce Learning to Watermark (LTW), a novel selective watermarking framework that leverages multi-objective optimization to effectively balance these competing goals. LTW features a lightweight network that adaptively decides when to apply the watermark by analyzing sentence embeddings, token entropy, and current watermarking ratio. Training of the network involves two specifically constructed loss functions that guide the model toward Pareto-optimal solutions, thereby harmonizing watermark detectability and text quality. By integrating LTW with two baseline watermarking methods, our experimental evaluations demonstrate that LTW significantly enhances text quality without compromising detectability. Our selective watermarking approach offers a new perspective for designing watermarks for LLMs and a way to preserve high text quality for watermarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction (AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning (CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP. Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in global precipitation forecasting.

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models. Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples. To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems, firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs. Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes $\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant distribution space.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life-threatening infectious syndrome associated with high mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early and accurate sepsis prediction (SP) is critical for timely intervention, yet remains challenging due to subtle early manifestations and rapidly escalating mortality. While AI has improved SP efficiency, existing methods struggle to capture weak early temporal signals. This paper introduces a Multi-Endogenous-view Representation Enhancement (MERE) mechanism to construct enriched feature views, coupled with a Cascaded Dual-convolution Time-series Attention (CDTA) module for multi-scale temporal representation learning. The proposed MEET-Sepsis framework achieves competitive prediction accuracy using only 20% of the ICU monitoring time required by SOTA methods, significantly advancing early SP. Extensive validation confirms its efficacy. Code is available at: https://github.com/yueliangy/MEET-Sepsis.

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models (LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains.

<title>Can GRPO Help LLMs Transcend Their Pretraining Origin?</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch, evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution (ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases. Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos, an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for vertical-domain LLM deployment.

<title>MCP Security Bench (MSB): Benchmarking Attacks Against Model Context Protocol in LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) standardizes how large language model (LLM) agents discover, describe, and call external tools. While MCP unlocks broad interoperability, it also enlarges the attack surface by making tools first-class, composable objects with natural-language metadata, and standardized I/O. We present MSB (MCP Security Benchmark), the first end-to-end evaluation suite that systematically measures how well LLM agents resist MCP-specific attacks throughout the full tool-use pipeline: task planning, tool invocation, and response handling. MSB contributes: (1) a taxonomy of 12 attacks including name-collision, preference manipulation, prompt injections embedded in tool descriptions, out-of-scope parameter requests, user-impersonating responses, false-error escalation, tool-transfer, retrieval injection, and mixed attacks; (2) an evaluation harness that executes attacks by running real tools (both benign and malicious) via MCP rather than simulation; and (3) a robustness metric that quantifies the trade-off between security and performance: Net Resilient Performance (NRP). We evaluate nine popular LLM agents across 10 domains and 400+ tools, producing 2,000 attack instances. Results reveal the effectiveness of attacks against each stage of MCP. Models with stronger performance are more vulnerable to attacks due to their outstanding tool calling and instruction following capabilities. MSB provides a practical baseline for researchers and practitioners to study, compare, and harden MCP agents.

<title>Using Kolmogorov-Smirnov Distance for Measuring Distribution Shift in Machine Learning</title>

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about 50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a more informed manner.

Abstract: Recent works have shown that natural gradient methods can significantly outperform standard optimizers when training physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In this paper, we analyze the training dynamics of PINNs optimized with ANaGRAM, a natural-gradient-inspired approach employing singular value decomposition with cutoff regularization. Building on this analysis, we propose a multi-cutoff adaptation strategy that further enhances ANaGRAM's performance. Experiments on benchmark PDEs validate the effectiveness of our method, which allows to reach machine precision on some experiments. To provide theoretical grounding, we develop a framework based on spectral theory that explains the necessity of regularization and extend previous shown connections with Green's functions theory.

<title>Layer-Aware Influence for Online Data Valuation Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16007</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation, we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining, fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation efficient and scalable in practice.

<title>InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans, and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection, highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city wide deployments.

<title>On-Chain Decentralized Learning and Cost-Effective Inference for DeFi Attack Mitigation</title>

Abstract: Billions of dollars are lost every year in DeFi platforms by transactions exploiting business logic or accounting vulnerabilities. Existing defenses focus on static code analysis, public mempool screening, attacker contract detection, or trusted off-chain monitors, none of which prevents exploits submitted through private relays or malicious contracts that execute within the same block. We present the first decentralized, fully on-chain learning framework that: (i) performs gas-prohibitive computation on Layer-2 to reduce cost, (ii) propagates verified model updates to Layer-1, and (iii) enables gas-bounded, low-latency inference inside smart contracts. A novel Proof-of-Improvement (PoIm) protocol governs the training process and verifies each decentralized micro update as a self-verifying training transaction. Updates are accepted by \textit{PoIm} only if they demonstrably improve at least one core metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, precision, or recall) on a public benchmark without degrading any of the other core metrics, while adversarial proposals get financially penalized through an adaptable test set for evolving threats. We develop quantization and loop-unrolling techniques that enable inference for logistic regression, SVM, MLPs, CNNs, and gated RNNs (with support for formally verified decision tree inference) within the Ethereum block gas limit, while remaining bit-exact to their off-chain counterparts, formally proven in Z3. We curate 298 unique real-world exploits (2020 - 2025) with 402 exploit transactions across eight EVM chains, collectively responsible for \$3.74 B in losses.

<title>Nondeterminism-Aware Optimistic Verification for Floating-Point Neural Networks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks increasingly run on hardware outside the user's control (cloud GPUs, inference marketplaces). Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about what actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended inputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps, quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings). Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous accelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either impractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present NAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that accepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than requiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound per-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile profiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored, threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph until one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight theoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical thresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without requiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a PyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum Holesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds, and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on Qwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100, RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than theoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success. NAO reconciles scalability with verifiability for real-world heterogeneous ML compute.

Abstract: The escalating frequency and severity of disasters routinely overwhelm traditional response capabilities, exposing critical vulnerability in disaster management. Current practices are hindered by fragmented data streams, siloed technologies, resource constraints, and the erosion of institutional memory, which collectively impede timely and effective decision making. This study introduces Disaster Copilot, a vision for a multi-agent artificial intelligence system designed to overcome these systemic challenges by unifying specialized AI tools within a collaborative framework. The proposed architecture utilizes a central orchestrator to coordinate diverse sub-agents, each specializing in critical domains such as predictive risk analytics, situational awareness, and impact assessment. By integrating multi-modal data, the system delivers a holistic, real-time operational picture and serve as the essential AI backbone required to advance Disaster Digital Twins from passive models to active, intelligent environments. Furthermore, it ensures functionality in resource-limited environments through on-device orchestration and incorporates mechanisms to capture institutional knowledge, mitigating the impact of staff turnover. We detail the system architecture and propose a three-phased roadmap emphasizing the parallel growth of technology, organizational capacity, and human-AI teaming. Disaster Copilot offers a transformative vision, fostering collective human-machine intelligence to build more adaptive, data-driven and resilient communities.

<title>RoBCtrl: Attacking GNN-Based Social Bot Detectors via Reinforced Manipulation of Bots Control Interaction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16035</link>

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors. Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the performance of GNN-based detectors.

Abstract: This study investigates the privacy risks associated with diffusion-based synthetic tabular data generation methods, focusing on their susceptibility to Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs). We examine two recent models, TabDDPM and TabSyn, by developing query-based MIAs based on the step-wise error comparison method. Our findings reveal that TabDDPM is more vulnerable to these attacks. TabSyn exhibits resilience against our attack models. Our work underscores the importance of evaluating the privacy implications of diffusion models and encourages further research into robust privacy-preserving mechanisms for synthetic data generation.

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time, serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation of grid-like codes in neural systems.

Abstract: Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is crucial for reducing latency, improving real-time processing, and enhancing privacy. By performing inference directly on the device, data does not need to be sent to the cloud, ensuring faster responses and reducing reliance on network connectivity. However, implementing LLMs on edge devices presents challenges, particularly with managing key-value (KV) caches, which plays a pivotal role in LLM serving. As the input text lengthens, the size of the KV cache increases linearly with the sequence length, leading to a significant memory footprint and data access costs. On the other hand, edge devices have limited memory and computational power, making it hard to store and efficiently access the large caches needed for LLM inference.
  To mitigate the substantial overhead caused by KV cache, we propose using embedded DRAM (eDRAM) as the primary storage for LLM serving in edge device, which offers higher storage density compared to SRAM. However, to ensure data integrity, eDRAM needs periodic refresh operations, which are power-intensive. To reduce eDRAM costs and improve overall system performance, we propose~\textit{Kelle}, a software-hardware co-design solution optimized for deploying LLMs on eDRAM-based edge systems. Combined with our fine-grained memory eviction, recomputation, and refresh control algorithms, the \textit{Kelle} accelerator delivers a $3.9\times$ speedup and $4.5\times$ energy savings compared to existing baseline solutions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the concept of Labour as an expression of `timenergy' - a fusion of time and energy - and its entanglement within the system of Capital. We define Labour as the commodified, quantifiable expansion of timenergy, in contrast to Capital, which is capable of accumulation and abstraction. We explore Labour's historical evolution, its coercive and alienating nature, and its transformation through automation and artificial intelligence. Using a game-theoretic, agent-based simulation, we model interactions between Capital and Labour in production processes governed by Cobb-Douglas functions. Our results show that despite theoretical symmetry, learning agents disproportionately gravitate toward capital-intensive processes, revealing Capital's superior organizational influence due to its accumulative capacity. We argue that Capital functions as an artificially alive system animated by the living Labour it consumes, and question whether life can sustain itself without the infrastructures of Capital in a future of increasing automation. This study offers both a critique of and a framework for understanding Labour's subjugation within the Capital system.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant, to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing, which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3 and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16 inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Any argument that open-source generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is inherently ethical or legal solely because it is open source is flawed. Yet, this is the explicit or implicit stance of several open-source GenAI entities. This paper critically examines prevalent justifications for "open-source exceptionalism," demonstrating how contemporary open-source GenAI often inadvertently facilitates unlawful conduct and environmental degradation without genuinely disrupting established oligopolies. Furthermore, the paper exposes the unsubstantiated and strategic deployment of "democratization" and "innovation" rhetoric to advocate for regulatory exemptions not afforded to proprietary systems.
  The conclusion is that open-source developers must be held to the same legal and ethical standards as all other actors in the technological ecosystem. However, the paper proposes a narrowly tailored safe harbor designed to protect legitimate, non-commercial scientific research, contingent upon adherence to specific criteria. Ultimately, this paper advocates for a framework of responsible AI development, wherein openness is pursued within established ethical and legal boundaries, with due consideration for its broader societal implications.

<title>In the Mood to Exclude: Revitalizing Trespass to Chattels in the Era of GenAI Scraping</title>

Abstract: This paper argues that website owners have the right to exclude others from their websites. Accordingly, when generative AI (GenAI) scraping bots intentionally circumvent reasonable technological barriers, their conduct could be actionable as trespass to chattels. If the scraping leads to a decrease in the website's value, then trespass to chattels should apply. The prevailing judicial focus on website content and the dismissal of trespass claims absent proof of server impairment or user disruption misconstrues the nature of the website itself as a form of digital property, focusing too narrowly on what constitutes harm under a claim of trespass. By shifting analysis from content to the website itself as an integrated digital asset and illustrating the harm to the value of the chattel, this paper demonstrates that the right to exclude applies online with the same force as it does to tangible property.
  Courts and litigants have struggled to police large-scale scraping because copyright preemption narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair use defense as the primary battleground. In contrast, recognizing websites as personal property revives trespass to chattels as a meaningful cause of action, providing website owners with an enforceable exclusionary right. Such protection would disincentivize exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for content creation, aid in protecting privacy and personal data, and safeguard values of autonomy and expression. Ultimately, this paper contends that reaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair and sustainable online environment.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS - an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability. GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of 27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold benchmark, and the framework code to support open research in desktop autonomy.

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence surrogates are systems designed to infer preferences when individuals lose decision-making capacity. Fairness in such systems is a domain that has been insufficiently explored. Traditional algorithmic fairness frameworks are insufficient for contexts where decisions are relational, existential, and culturally diverse. This paper explores an ethical framework for algorithmic fairness in AI surrogates by mapping major fairness notions onto potential real-world end-of-life scenarios. It then examines fairness across moral traditions. The authors argue that fairness in this domain extends beyond parity of outcomes to encompass moral representation, fidelity to the patient's values, relationships, and worldview.

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234 radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of 62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a 95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions, agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored, despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e., over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs. Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently, we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page: https://correctbench.github.io/

Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however, struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for distribution systems.

<title>Residual Correction Models for AC Optimal Power Flow Using DC Optimal Power Flow Solutions</title>

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-, 118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Despite accounting for 96.1% of all businesses in Malaysia, access to financing remains one of the most persistent challenges faced by Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Newly established or young businesses are often excluded from formal credit markets as traditional underwriting approaches rely heavily on credit bureau data. This study investigates the potential of bank statement data as an alternative data source for credit assessment to promote financial inclusion in emerging markets. Firstly, we propose a cash flow-based underwriting pipeline where we utilise bank statement data for end to end data extraction and machine learning credit scoring. Secondly, we introduce a novel dataset of 611 loan applicants from a Malaysian lending institution. Thirdly, we develop and evaluate credit scoring models based on application information and bank transaction-derived features. Empirical results show that the use of such data boosts the performance of all models on our dataset, which can improve credit scoring for new-to-lending MSMEs. Lastly, we intend to release the anonymised bank transaction dataset to facilitate further research on MSMEs financial inclusion within Malaysia's emerging economy.

Abstract: Creating interdisciplinary design projects is time-consuming and cognitively demanding for teachers, requiring curriculum alignment, cross-subject integration, and careful sequencing. International research reports increasing teacher use of AI alongside persistent workload pressures, underscoring the need for planning support. This paper presents the Interdisciplinary Design Project Planner (IDPplanner), a GPT-based planning assistant grounded in Design Innovation principles, alignment with Singapore secondary school syllabuses, and 21st-century competencies. In a within-subject, counterbalanced workshop with 33 in-service teachers, participants produced two versions of the same project: manual and AI-assisted, followed by self- and peer-evaluations using a six-dimensional rubric. The AI-assisted version received higher scores for Curriculum Alignment, Design Thinking Application, and Coherence and Flow, with a marginal advantage for Assessment Strategies. Teacher reflections indicated that AI-assisted planning improved structure, sequencing, and idea generation, while contextualization to local syllabuses, class profiles, and student needs remained teacher-led. Contributions include a purpose-built planning tool that organizes ideas into a ten-component flow with ready-to-adapt prompts, templates, and assessment suggestions; an empirical, rubric-based comparison of planning quality; and evidence that AI can function as a pedagogical planning partner. Recommendations emphasize hybrid teacher-AI workflows to enhance curriculum alignment and reduce planning complexity, and design suggestions for developers to strengthen contextual customization, iterative design support, and localized rubrics. Although instantiated with a Singapore-based curriculum, the planning flow and rubric are framework-agnostic and can be parameterized for other systems.

Abstract: As design thinking education grows in secondary and tertiary contexts, educators face the challenge of evaluating creative artefacts that combine visual and textual elements. Traditional rubric-based assessment is laborious, time-consuming, and inconsistent due to reliance on Teaching Assistants (TA) in large, multi-section cohorts. This paper presents an exploratory study investigating the reliability and perceived accuracy of AI-assisted assessment compared to TA-assisted assessment in evaluating student posters in design thinking education. Two activities were conducted with 33 Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore school teachers to (1) compare AI-generated scores with TA grading across three key dimensions: empathy and user understanding, identification of pain points and opportunities, and visual communication, and (2) examine teacher preferences for AI-assigned, TA-assigned, and hybrid scores. Results showed low statistical agreement between instructor and AI scores for empathy and pain points, with slightly higher alignment for visual communication. Teachers preferred TA-assigned scores in six of ten samples. Qualitative feedback highlighted the potential of AI for formative feedback, consistency, and student self-reflection, but raised concerns about its limitations in capturing contextual nuance and creative insight. The study underscores the need for hybrid assessment models that integrate computational efficiency with human insights. This research contributes to the evolving conversation on responsible AI adoption in creative disciplines, emphasizing the balance between automation and human judgment for scalable and pedagogically sound assessment.

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT), structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience. Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students) each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy (compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience. Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$ s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm 58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s (FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P < .001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic accuracy and user satisfaction.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on irregular domains.

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation (BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24 percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%. Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense neural networks via a novel ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation. Using the Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output (before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1 and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items, significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments. Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations, thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via: https://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL.

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in 4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

Abstract: We present a practical match-on-card design for face verification in which compact 64/128-bit templates are produced off-card by PCA-ITQ and compared on-card via constant-time Hamming distance. We specify ISO/IEC 7816-4 and 14443-4 command APDUs with fixed-length payloads and decision-only status words (no score leakage), together with a minimal per-identity EEPROM map. Using real binary codes from a CelebA working set (55 identities, 412 images), we (i) derive operating thresholds from ROC/DET, (ii) replay enroll->verify transactions at those thresholds, and (iii) bound end-to-end time by pure link latency plus a small constant on-card budget. Even at the slowest contact rate (9.6 kbps), total verification time is 43.9 ms (64 b) and 52.3 ms (128 b); at 38.4 kbps both are <14 ms. At FAR = 1%, both code lengths reach TPR = 0.836, while 128 b lowers EER relative to 64 b. An optional +6 B helper (targeted symbol-level parity over empirically unstable bits) is latency-negligible. Overall, short binary templates, fixed-payload decision-only APDUs, and constant-time matching satisfy ISO/IEC transport constraints with wide timing margin and align with ISO/IEC 24745 privacy goals. Limitations: single-dataset evaluation and design-level (pre-hardware) timing; we outline AgeDB/CFP-FP and on-card microbenchmarks as next steps.

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making, accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously improving systems.

Abstract: Emergency departments worldwide face rising patient volumes, workforce shortages, and variability in triage decisions that threaten the delivery of timely and accurate care. Current triage methods rely primarily on vital signs, routine laboratory values, and clinicians' judgment, which, while effective, often miss emerging biological signals that could improve risk prediction for infection typing or antibiotic administration in acute conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce TriAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that couples automated biomarker discovery with deep research for literature-grounded validation and novelty assessment. TriAgent employs a supervisor research agent to generate research topics and delegate targeted queries to specialized sub-agents for evidence retrieval from various data sources. Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either grounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering transparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care risk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine clinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data analysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and expand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a user's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic adherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over 10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more than 50%. Across experiments, TriAgent consistently outperformed state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic frameworks in biomarker justification and literature-grounded novelty assessment.

Abstract: While Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise in healthcare applications, existing conversational systems often falter in complex and sensitive medical domains such as Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). These systems frequently struggle with hallucination and lack the specialized knowledge required, particularly for sensitive SRH topics. Furthermore, current AI approaches in healthcare tend to prioritize diagnostic capabilities over comprehensive patient care and education. Addressing these gaps, this work at the UNC School of Nursing introduces SARHAchat, a proof-of-concept Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot. SARHAchat is designed as a reliable, user-centered system integrating medical expertise with empathetic communication to enhance SRH care delivery. Our evaluation demonstrates SARHAchat's ability to provide accurate and contextually appropriate contraceptive counseling while maintaining a natural conversational flow. The demo is available at https://sarhachat.com/}{https://sarhachat.com/.

Abstract: We propose CITE V.1, an agentic, evidence-grounded framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide transparent and reproducible interpretations of RNA-seq clusters. Unlike existing enrichment-based approaches that reduce results to broad statistical associations and LLM-only models that risk unsupported claims or fabricated citations, CITE V.1 transforms cluster interpretation by producing biologically coherent explanations explicitly anchored in the biomedical literature. The framework orchestrates three specialized agents: a Retriever that gathers domain knowledge from PubMed and UniProt, an Interpreter that formulates functional hypotheses, and Critics that evaluate claims, enforce evidence grounding, and qualify uncertainty through confidence and reliability indicators. Applied to Salmonella enterica RNA-seq data, CITE V.1 generated biologically meaningful insights supported by the literature, while an LLM-only Gemini baseline frequently produced speculative results with false citations. By moving RNA-seq analysis from surface-level enrichment to auditable, interpretable, and evidence-based hypothesis generation, CITE V.1 advances the transparency and reliability of AI in biomedicine.

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations -- defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse likelihood as actionable risk scores.

Abstract: The 2022 World Mental Health Report calls for global mental health care reform, amid rising prevalence of issues like anxiety and depression that affect nearly one billion people worldwide. Traditional in-person therapy fails to meet this demand, and the situation is worsened by stigma. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) offer efficiency for AI-driven mental health solutions, they underperform because they lack specialized fine-tuning. Existing LLM-based mental health chatbots can engage in empathetic conversations, but they overlook real-time user mental state assessment which is critical for professional counseling. This paper proposes MoPHES, a framework that integrates mental state evaluation, conversational support, and professional treatment recommendations. The agent developed under this framework uses two fine-tuned MiniCPM4-0.5B LLMs: one is fine-tuned on mental health conditions datasets to assess users' mental states and predict the severity of anxiety and depression; the other is fine-tuned on multi-turn dialogues to handle conversations with users. By leveraging insights into users' mental states, our agent provides more tailored support and professional treatment recommendations. Both models are also deployed directly on mobile devices to enhance user convenience and protect user privacy. Additionally, to evaluate the performance of MoPHES with other LLMs, we develop a benchmark for the automatic evaluation of mental state prediction and multi-turn counseling dialogues, which includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, datasets, and methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge. This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i) Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase, reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected. Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift (measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes, highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code: https://github.com/Bhoy1/STABLE

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection) across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance; zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that (1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples / demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source implementation of our system at https://github.com/Networks-Learning/narrowing-action-choices .

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance. This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset, outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios, our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion models and guidance functions.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of Beyond 5G and 6G networks necessitates new paradigms for autonomy and assur- ance. Traditional O-RAN control loops rely heavily on RIC- based orchestration, which centralizes intelligence and exposes the system to risks such as policy conflicts, data drift, and unsafe actions under unforeseen conditions. In this work, we argue that the future of autonomous networks lies in a multi-agentic architecture, where specialized agents collaborate to perform data collection, model training, prediction, policy generation, verification, deployment, and assurance. By replacing tightly- coupled centralized RIC-based workflows with distributed agents, the framework achieves autonomy, resilience, explainability, and system-wide safety. To substantiate this vision, we design and evaluate a traffic steering use case under surge and drift conditions. Results across four KPIs: RRC connected users, IP throughput, PRB utilization, and SINR, demonstrate that a naive predictor-driven deployment improves local KPIs but destabilizes neighbors, whereas the agentic system blocks unsafe policies, preserving global network health. This study highlights multi- agent architectures as a credible foundation for trustworthy AI- driven autonomy in next-generation RANs.

Abstract: Scientific literature is increasingly siloed by complex language, static disciplinary structures, and potentially sparse keyword systems, making it cumbersome to capture the dynamic nature of modern science. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an adaptable large language model (LLM)-driven framework to quantify thematic trends and map the evolving landscape of scientific knowledge. The approach is demonstrated over a 20-year collection of more than 1,500 engineering articles published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), marked for their breadth and depth of research focus. A two-stage classification pipeline first establishes a primary thematic category for each article based on its abstract. The subsequent phase performs a full-text analysis to assign secondary classifications, revealing latent, cross-topic connections across the corpus. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), confirm the resulting topical structure and also suggest that standalone word-frequency analyses may be insufficient for mapping fields with high diversity. Finally, a disjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications reveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when analyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach independently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure without prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g., biological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a powerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a high-level overview of scientific progress.

Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration on complex reasoning tasks requires that users understand and interact with the model's process, not just receive an output. However, the monolithic text from methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prevents this, as current interfaces lack real-time verbalization and robust user barge-in. We present AsyncVoice Agent, a system whose asynchronous architecture decouples a streaming LLM backend from a conversational voice frontend. This design allows narration and inference to run in parallel, empowering users to interrupt, query, and steer the model's reasoning process at any time. Objective benchmarks show this approach reduces interaction latency by more than 600x compared to monolithic baselines while ensuring high fidelity and competitive task accuracy. By enabling a two-way dialogue with a model's thought process, AsyncVoice Agent offers a new paradigm for building more effective, steerable, and trustworthy human-AI systems for high-stakes tasks.

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data augmentation-based defenses.

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics. Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points: (i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification, whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments, highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

Abstract: Real-world multi-agent systems may require ad hoc teaming, where an agent must coordinate with other previously unseen teammates to solve a task in a zero-shot manner. Prior work often either selects a pretrained policy based on an inferred model of the new teammates or pretrains a single policy that is robust to potential teammates. Instead, we propose to leverage all pretrained policies in a zero-shot transfer setting. We formalize this problem as an ad hoc multi-agent Markov decision process and present a solution that uses two key ideas, generalized policy improvement and difference rewards, for efficient and effective knowledge transfer between different teams. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm, Generalized Policy improvement for Ad hoc Teaming (GPAT), successfully enables zero-shot transfer to new teams in three simulated environments: cooperative foraging, predator-prey, and Overcooked. We also demonstrate our algorithm in a real-world multi-robot setting.

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and image reconstruction.

<title>Revealing Low-Dimensional Structure in 2D Richtmyer-Meshkov Instabilities via Parametric Reduced-Order Modeling</title>

Abstract: Efficient modeling of the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is essential to many engineering tasks, including high-speed combustion and drive and capsule geometry optimization in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.

Abstract: Malicious agents pose significant threats to the reliability and decision-making capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses often fall short due to reactive designs or centralized architectures which may introduce single points of failure. To address these challenges, we propose SentinelNet, the first decentralized framework for proactively detecting and mitigating malicious behaviors in multi-agent collaboration. SentinelNet equips each agent with a credit-based detector trained via contrastive learning on augmented adversarial debate trajectories, enabling autonomous evaluation of message credibility and dynamic neighbor ranking via bottom-k elimination to suppress malicious communications. To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates adversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training. Experiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection of malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95% of system accuracy from compromised baselines. By exhibiting strong generalizability across domains and attack patterns, SentinelNet establishes a novel paradigm for safeguarding collaborative MAS.

<title>What Can String Probability Tell Us About Grammaticality?</title>

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM grammatical evaluation.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on policies within the European Green Deal. We present a dataset of 165 policies, incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording and metadata including political party and country representation. These findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy analysis and decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation. However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction frameworks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) providers expose fine-tuning APIs that let end users fine-tune their frontier LLMs. Unfortunately, it has been shown that an adversary with fine-tuning access to an LLM can bypass safeguards. Particularly concerning, such attacks may avoid detection with datasets that are only implicitly harmful. Our work studies robust detection mechanisms for adversarial use of fine-tuning APIs. We introduce the concept of a fine-tuning auditing agent and show it can detect harmful fine-tuning prior to model deployment. We provide our auditing agent with access to the fine-tuning dataset, as well as the fine-tuned and pre-fine-tuned models, and request the agent assigns a risk score for the fine-tuning job. We evaluate our detection approach on a diverse set of eight strong fine-tuning attacks from the literature, along with five benign fine-tuned models, totaling over 1400 independent audits. These attacks are undetectable with basic content moderation on the dataset, highlighting the challenge of the task. With the best set of affordances, our auditing agent achieves a 56.2% detection rate of adversarial fine-tuning at a 1% false positive rate. Most promising, the auditor is able to detect covert cipher attacks that evade safety evaluations and content moderation of the dataset. While benign fine-tuning with unintentional subtle safety degradation remains a challenge, we establish a baseline configuration for further work in this area. We release our auditing agent at https://github.com/safety-research/finetuning-auditor.

Abstract: The evaluation of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) agents is hindered by the coarse, end-task success metric that fails to provide precise skill diagnosis or measure robustness to real-world perturbations. This challenge is exacerbated by a fragmented data landscape that impedes reproducible research and the development of generalist models. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{NEBULA}, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation. NEBULA features a novel dual-axis evaluation protocol that combines fine-grained \textit{capability tests} for precise skill diagnosis with systematic \textit{stress tests} that measure robustness. A standardized API and a large-scale, aggregated dataset are provided to reduce fragmentation and support cross-dataset training and fair comparison. Using NEBULA, we demonstrate that top-performing VLAs struggle with key capabilities such as spatial reasoning and dynamic adaptation, which are consistently obscured by conventional end-task success metrics. By measuring both what an agent can do and when it does so reliably, NEBULA provides a practical foundation for robust, general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: Discrete representation learning has shown promising results across various domains, including generation and understanding in image, speech and language. Inspired by these advances, we propose MuseTok, a tokenization method for symbolic music, and investigate its effectiveness in both music generation and understanding tasks. MuseTok employs the residual vector quantized-variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE) on bar-wise music segments within a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, producing music codes that achieve high-fidelity music reconstruction and accurate understanding of music theory. For comprehensive evaluation, we apply MuseTok to music generation and semantic understanding tasks, including melody extraction, chord recognition, and emotion recognition. Models incorporating MuseTok outperform previous representation learning baselines in semantic understanding while maintaining comparable performance in content generation. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on MuseTok codes, using ground-truth categories and synthetic datasets, reveal that MuseTok effectively captures underlying musical concepts from large music collections.

Abstract: Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in genetic pathways (hyperedges).

Abstract: The development of automated experimental facilities and the digitization of experimental data have introduced numerous opportunities to radically advance chemical laboratories. As many laboratory tasks involve predicting and understanding previously unknown chemical relationships, machine learning (ML) approaches trained on experimental data can substantially accelerate the conventional design-build-test-learn process. This outlook article aims to help chemists understand and begin to adopt ML predictive models for a variety of laboratory tasks, including experimental design, synthesis optimization, and materials characterization. Furthermore, this article introduces how artificial intelligence (AI) agents based on large language models can help researchers acquire background knowledge in chemical or data science and accelerate various aspects of the discovery process. We present three case studies in distinct areas to illustrate how ML models and AI agents can be leveraged to reduce time-consuming experiments and manual data analysis. Finally, we highlight existing challenges that require continued synergistic effort from both experimental and computational communities to address.

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark, OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving techniques.

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

Abstract: Lung cancer, a malignancy originating in lung tissues, is commonly diagnosed and classified using medical imaging techniques, particularly computed tomography (CT). Despite the integration of machine learning and deep learning methods, the predictive efficacy of automated systems for lung cancer classification from CT images remains below the desired threshold for clinical adoption. Existing research predominantly focuses on binary classification, distinguishing between malignant and benign lung nodules. In this study, a novel deep learning-based approach is introduced, aimed at an improved multi-class classification, discerning various subtypes of lung cancer from CT images. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet model, lung tissue images were classified into three distinct classes, two of which denote malignancy and one benign. Employing a dataset comprising 15,000 lung CT images sourced from the LC25000 histopathological images, the ResNet50 model was trained on 10,200 images, validated on 2,550 images, and tested on the remaining 2,250 images. Through the incorporation of custom layers atop the ResNet architecture and meticulous hyperparameter fine-tuning, a remarkable test accuracy of 98.8% was recorded. This represents a notable enhancement over the performance of prior models on the same dataset.

Abstract: Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and "think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

Abstract: Assembly hinges on reliably forming connections between parts; yet most robotic approaches plan assembly sequences and part poses while treating connectors as an afterthought. Connections represent the critical "last mile" of assembly execution, while task planning may sequence operations and motion plan may position parts, the precise establishment of physical connections ultimately determines assembly success or failure. In this paper, we consider connections as first-class primitives in assembly representation, including connector types, specifications, quantities, and placement locations. Drawing inspiration from how humans learn assembly tasks through step-by-step instruction manuals, we present Manual2Skill++, a vision-language framework that automatically extracts structured connection information from assembly manuals. We encode assembly tasks as hierarchical graphs where nodes represent parts and sub-assemblies, and edges explicitly model connection relationships between components. A large-scale vision-language model parses symbolic diagrams and annotations in manuals to instantiate these graphs, leveraging the rich connection knowledge embedded in human-designed instructions. We curate a dataset containing over 20 assembly tasks with diverse connector types to validate our representation extraction approach, and evaluate the complete task understanding-to-execution pipeline across four complex assembly scenarios in simulation, spanning furniture, toys, and manufacturing components with real-world correspondence.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale, annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a range of experience levels. This resource is enriched with four annotation layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR. The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out center. The dataset and annotations are available in Google Form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmyMAPSTGrIy2sTnz0-TMw08ZagTimRulbAQcWdaPwDy187A/viewform?usp=dialog).

In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations, leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2) completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

<title>Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization</title>

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.

<title>MoReBench: Evaluating Procedural and Pluralistic Moral Reasoning in Language Models, More than Outcomes</title>

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces, present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations, weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously. Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a promising solution to achieving unparalleled scalability in deep learning by decoupling model parameter count from computational cost. By activating only a small subset of parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work, we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular, and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE. Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.

<title>SSL4RL: Revisiting Self-supervised Learning as Intrinsic Reward for Visual-Language Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains. SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios. Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts. However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring, struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation, hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE, a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task performance and improved expert utilization balance.

Abstract: In many industrial settings, users wish to ask questions in natural language, the answers to which require assembling information from diverse structured data sources. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), applications can now translate natural language questions into a set of API calls or database calls, execute them, and combine the results into an appropriate natural language response. However, these applications remain impractical in realistic industrial settings because they do not cope with the data source heterogeneity that typifies such environments. In this work, we simulate the heterogeneity of real industry settings by introducing two extensions of the popular Spider benchmark dataset that require a combination of database and API calls. Then, we introduce a declarative approach to handling such data heterogeneity and demonstrate that it copes with data source heterogeneity significantly better than state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic or imperative code generation systems. Our augmented benchmarks are available to the research community.

<title>Automated Composition of Agents: A Knapsack Approach for Agentic Component Selection</title>

Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints.

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled. Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval process via the representative models we construct for the images and image categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

Abstract: Advances in open-vocabulary semantic mapping and object navigation have enabled robots to perform an informed search of their environment for an arbitrary object. However, such zero-shot object navigation is typically designed for simple queries with an object name like "television" or "blue rug". Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial relationships, such as "find the remote on the table" while still leveraging robustness of a semantic map. We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i) Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original, complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial search queries to more effectively guide the search process. We validate our system through extensive experiments on the MultiON benchmark and real-world deployment on a Boston Dynamics Spot robot using a Jetson Orin AGX.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification remains a major challenge due to its multifactorial nature and limited availability of high-quality labeled datasets. While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions, enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog, complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models (LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more effective and data-efficient learning agents.

<title>Toward Understanding Security Issues in the Model Context Protocol Ecosystem</title>

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging open standard that enables AI-powered applications to interact with external tools through structured metadata. A rapidly growing ecosystem has formed around MCP, including a wide range of MCP hosts (i.e., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and Cline), MCP registries (i.e., mcp.so, MCP Market, MCP Store, Pulse MCP, Smithery, and npm), and thousands of community-contributed MCP servers. Although the MCP ecosystem is gaining traction, there has been little systematic study of its architecture and associated security risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of the MCP ecosystem. We decompose MCP ecosystem into three core components: hosts, registries, and servers, and study the interactions and trust relationships among them. Users search for servers on registries and configure them in the host, which translates LLM-generated output into external tool invocations provided by the servers and executes them. Our qualitative analysis reveals that hosts lack output verification mechanisms for LLM-generated outputs, enabling malicious servers to manipulate model behavior and induce a variety of security threats, including but not limited to sensitive data exfiltration. We uncover a wide range of vulnerabilities that enable attackers to hijack servers, due to the lack of a vetted server submission process in registries. To support our analysis, we collect and analyze a dataset of 67,057 servers from six public registries. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that a substantial number of servers can be hijacked by attackers. Finally, we propose practical defense strategies for MCP hosts, registries, and users. We responsibly disclosed our findings to affected hosts and registries.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.

<title>AI-Generated Text Detection in Low-Resource Languages: A Case Study on Urdu</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests. Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set. This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed. Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing data scarcity.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data. Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

<title>SHIELD: Suppressing Hallucinations In LVLM Encoders via Bias and Vulnerability Defense</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks. However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be released.

<title>Asymptotically Stable Quaternion-valued Hopfield-structured Neural Network with Periodic Projection-based Supervised Learning Rules</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms, where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however, interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet, and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures, ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR. Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%, segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80 milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

<title>Prompt Optimization via Retrieved Reasoning Assets and Multi-Agent Analysis</title>

Abstract: Prompt optimization has emerged as an effective alternative to retraining for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing approaches treat evaluation as a black box, relying solely on numerical scores while offering limited insight into why a prompt succeeds or fails. They also depend heavily on trial-and-error refinements, which are difficult to interpret and control. In this paper, we introduce MA-SAPO, a Multi-Agent framework for Score-Aware Prompt Optimization. Compared to prior methods, MA-SAPO explicitly couples evaluation outcomes with structured reasoning to guide systematic edits. The framework specifically consists of two stages: during the Reasoning Phase, agents collaboratively explain metric scores, diagnose weaknesses, and synthesize targeted refinements that are stored as reusable reasoning assets; during the Test Phase, agents retrieve these assets to analyze optimized prompts and apply only evidence-grounded edits. By turning evaluation signals into interpretable reasoning chains, MA-SAPO produces prompt refinements that are more transparent, auditable, and controllable. Experiments on the HelpSteer1/2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over single-pass prompting, retrieval-augmented baselines, and prior multi-agent strategies, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially reducing the token count of the scene graph content.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

Abstract: Effective visualization retrieval necessitates a clear definition of similarity. Despite the growing body of work in specialized visualization retrieval systems, a systematic approach to understanding visualization similarity remains absent. We introduce the Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval (Safire), a conceptual model that frames visualization similarity along two dimensions: comparison criteria and representation modalities. Comparison criteria identify the aspects that make visualizations similar, which we divide into primary facets (data, visual encoding, interaction, style, metadata) and derived properties (data-centric and human-centric measures). Safire connects what to compare with how comparisons are executed through representation modalities. We categorize existing representation approaches into four groups based on their levels of information content and visualization determinism: raster image, vector image, specification, and natural language description, together guiding what is computable and comparable. We analyze several visualization retrieval systems using Safire to demonstrate its practical value in clarifying similarity considerations. Our findings reveal how particular criteria and modalities align across different use cases. Notably, the choice of representation modality is not only an implementation detail but also an important decision that shapes retrieval capabilities and limitations. Based on our analysis, we provide recommendations and discuss broader implications for multimodal learning, AI applications, and visualization reproducibility.

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner (i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g., 84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on Llama3.2-1B).

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding, remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set (MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of 3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of high-quality training data for future models.

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based frameworks.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data, which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature, among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process, we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types, cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in cardiology to date.

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence. Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding scenarios.

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy, manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii) useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational overhead.

<title>Region in Context: Text-condition Image editing with Human-like semantic reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16772</link>

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure. Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned results. Code is available at: https://github.com/thuyvuphuong/Region-in-Context.git

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of 3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation across a large set of games.

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

<title>Xiaoice: Training-Free Video Understanding via Self-Supervised Spatio-Temporal Clustering of Semantic Features</title>

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding. In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering, bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres. Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

<title>More with Less: An Empirical Study of Turn-Control Strategies for Efficient Coding Agents</title>

Abstract: LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a "sweet spot", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced joint supervision and staged adaptation.

<title>Mixed-Precision Quantization for Language Models: Techniques and Prospects</title>

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8, INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting. Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

<title>Improving Model Representation and Reducing KV Cache via Skip Connections with First Value Heads</title>

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only 10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving performance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology: positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters) selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using the numerical features across all model sizes.

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity $\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$, while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$ while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS). ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed -- creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations, while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking. This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles -- patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321 questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

Abstract: We propose Schr\"odinger Bridge Mamba (SBM), a new concept of training-inference framework motivated by the inherent compatibility between Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) training paradigm and selective state-space model Mamba. We exemplify the concept of SBM with an implementation for generative speech enhancement. Experiments on a joint denoising and dereverberation task using four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SBM, with only 1-step inference, outperforms strong baselines with 1-step or iterative inference and achieves the best real-time factor (RTF). Beyond speech enhancement, we discuss the integration of SB paradigm and selective state-space model architecture based on their underlying alignment, which indicates a promising direction for exploring new deep generative models potentially applicable to a broad range of generative tasks.

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight), a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory (CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts. Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

<title>Neuronal Group Communication for Efficient Neural representation</title>

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability. This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability. Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional learning systems.

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents, capable of complex planning and action, represent a significant technological evolution beyond current generative tools. As these systems become integrated into political and economic life, their distribution and capabilities will be highly consequential. This paper introduces and explores "agentic inequality" - the potential disparities in power, opportunity, and outcomes stemming from differential access to, and capabilities of, AI agents. We analyse the dual potential of this technology, exploring how agents could both exacerbate existing divides and, under the right conditions, serve as a powerful equalising force. To this end, the paper makes three primary contributions. First, it establishes an analytical framework by delineating the three core dimensions through which this inequality can manifest: disparities in the availability, quality, and quantity of agents. Second, it argues that agentic inequality is distinct from prior technological divides. Unlike tools that primarily augment human abilities, agents act as autonomous delegates, creating novel power asymmetries through scalable goal delegation and direct agent-to-agent competition that are poised to reshape outcomes across economic and socio-political spheres. Finally, it provides a systematic analysis of the technical and socioeconomic drivers - from model release strategies to market incentives - that will shape the distribution of agentic power, concluding with a research agenda for navigating the complex governance challenges ahead.

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios. This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver, and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in distributed security infrastructure.

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing this challenge through a biologically inspired design.

<title>Utility-Diversity Aware Online Batch Selection for LLM Supervised Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend text-based LLMs with auditory understanding, offering new opportunities for multimodal applications. While their perception, reasoning, and task performance have been widely studied, their safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored. This work systematically investigates the role of speaker emotion. We construct a dataset of malicious speech instructions expressed across multiple emotions and intensities, and evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs. Our results reveal substantial safety inconsistencies: different emotions elicit varying levels of unsafe responses, and the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. These findings highlight an overlooked vulnerability in LALMs and call for alignment strategies explicitly designed to ensure robustness under emotional variation, a prerequisite for trustworthy deployment in real-world settings.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity prices is crucial for stakeholders in the energy market, particularly for grid operators, energy producers, and consumers. This study focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in the California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features, including historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation mix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online learning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data incrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results demonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance, aligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during peak intervals. Also, the online learning model outperforms other models by effectively incorporating real-time data, resulting in lower prediction error and variability. The inclusion of the energy generation mix further enhances the model's predictive capabilities, highlighting the importance of comprehensive feature integration. This research provides a robust framework for electricity price forecasting, offering valuable insights and tools for better decision-making in dynamic electricity markets.

Abstract: The effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is significantly hindered by unstructured clinical documentation, which results in noisy, inconsistent, and logically fragmented training data. To address this challenge, we present a knowledge-driven framework that integrates the standardized clinical terminology SNOMED CT with the Neo4j graph database to construct a structured medical knowledge graph. In this graph, clinical entities such as diseases, symptoms, and medications are represented as nodes, and semantic relationships such as ``caused by,'' ``treats,'' and ``belongs to'' are modeled as edges in Neo4j, with types mapped from formal SNOMED CT relationship concepts (e.g., \texttt{Causative agent}, \texttt{Indicated for}). This design enables multi-hop reasoning and ensures terminological consistency. By extracting and standardizing entity-relationship pairs from clinical texts, we generate structured, JSON-formatted datasets that embed explicit diagnostic pathways. These datasets are used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs), significantly improving the clinical logic consistency of their outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that our knowledge-guided approach enhances the validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning, providing a scalable solution for building reliable AI-assisted clinical systems.

Abstract: How can short-term energy consumption be accurately forecasted when sensor data is noisy, incomplete, and lacks contextual richness? This question guided our participation in the \textit{2025 Competition on Electric Energy Consumption Forecast Adopting Multi-criteria Performance Metrics}, which challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL) pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy. Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably, spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability. These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring, retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL) methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

Abstract: Knowledge editing offers an efficient way to update model knowledge without full retraining, but prior work has concentrated almost exclusively on textual or visual modalities. We introduce SAKE, the first benchmark specifically designed for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). Unlike factual updates, SAKE targets several abstract auditory attributes, capturing knowledge types that go beyond conventional textual and visual domains. We benchmark seven editing methods on two LALMs along four dimensions: reliability, generality, audio/text locality, and portability. Results highlight challenges such as preserving intra-attribute knowledge unrelated to the edit, generalizing edits to multimodal reasoning, and maintaining edits under sequential updates. SAKE provides a principled framework to study how knowledge editing extends to the auditory modalities, opening new directions for maintaining and adapting LALMs in more diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in safety critical applications like autonomous driving use simulations to test their robustness against adversarial attacks in realistic conditions. However, these simulations are non-differentiable, forcing researchers to create attacks that do not integrate simulation environmental factors, reducing attack success. To address this limitation, we introduce UNDREAM, the first software framework that bridges the gap between photorealistic simulators and differentiable renderers to enable end-to-end optimization of adversarial perturbations on any 3D objects. UNDREAM enables manipulation of the environment by offering complete control over weather, lighting, backgrounds, camera angles, trajectories, and realistic human and object movements, thereby allowing the creation of diverse scenes. We showcase a wide array of distinct physically plausible adversarial objects that UNDREAM enables researchers to swiftly explore in different configurable environments. This combination of photorealistic simulation and differentiable optimization opens new avenues for advancing research of physical adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Recent leaps in large language models (LLMs) caused a revolution in programming tools (like GitHub Copilot) that can help with code generation, debugging, and even performance optimization. In this paper, we focus on the capabilities of the most recent reasoning models to generate optimized CUDA code for predefined, well-known tasks. Our objective is to determine which types of code optimizations and parallel patterns the LLMs can perform by themselves and whether they can be improved by tutoring (providing more detailed hints and guidelines in the prompt). The generated solutions were evaluated both automatically (for correctness and speedup) and manually (code reviews) to provide a more detailed perspective. We also tried an interactive approach where the LLM can fix its previous mistakes within a session. The results indicate that LLMs are quite skilled coders; however, they require tutoring to reach optimized solutions provided by parallel computing experts.

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error (RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability. Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained, diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024) demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models (LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks. Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive, reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models, FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented, lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities. To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks. Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation, efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs, thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward efficient one-step diffusion generation.

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs. This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters, enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at 88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Abstract: Ensuring the long-term reliability of AI models in clinical practice requires continuous performance monitoring and corrective actions when degradation occurs. Addressing this need, this manuscript presents ReclAIm, a multi-agent framework capable of autonomously monitoring, evaluating, and fine-tuning medical image classification models. The system, built on a large language model core, operates entirely through natural language interaction, eliminating the need for programming expertise. ReclAIm successfully trains, evaluates, and maintains consistent performance of models across MRI, CT, and X-ray datasets. Once ReclAIm detects significant performance degradation, it autonomously executes state-of-the-art fine-tuning procedures that substantially reduce the performance gap. In cases with performance drops of up to -41.1% (MRI InceptionV3), ReclAIm managed to readjust performance metrics within 1.5% of the initial model results. ReclAIm enables automated, continuous maintenance of medical imaging AI models in a user-friendly and adaptable manner that facilitates broader adoption in both research and clinical environments.

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay. We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling efficiency with fairness preserved.

<title>DINO-CVA: A Multimodal Goal-Conditioned Vision-to-Action Model for Autonomous Catheter Navigation</title>

Abstract: Cardiac catheterization remains a cornerstone of minimally invasive interventions, yet it continues to rely heavily on manual operation. Despite advances in robotic platforms, existing systems are predominantly follow-leader in nature, requiring continuous physician input and lacking intelligent autonomy. This dependency contributes to operator fatigue, more radiation exposure, and variability in procedural outcomes. This work moves towards autonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual observations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling policies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted autoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding navigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a synthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and evaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in predicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline while additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These findings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned architectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward reducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased therapies.

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in substantial computational overhead during both training and inference. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking" process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel, theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some examples in this paper may be upsetting.

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition. Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5% reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy.

<title>Explainable Heterogeneous Anomaly Detection in Financial Networks via Adaptive Expert Routing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17088</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions. Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48 (66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism identification without labeled supervision.

<title>Can Transformer Memory Be Corrupted? Investigating Cache-Side Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2510.17098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even when prompts and parameters are secured, transformer language models remain vulnerable because their key-value (KV) cache during inference constitutes an overlooked attack surface. This paper introduces Malicious Token Injection (MTI), a modular framework that systematically perturbs cached key vectors at selected layers and timesteps through controlled magnitude and frequency, using additive Gaussian noise, zeroing, and orthogonal rotations. A theoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through attention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and softmax Lipschitz dynamics. Empirical results show that MTI significantly alters next-token distributions and downstream task performance across GPT-2 and LLaMA-2/7B, as well as destabilizes retrieval-augmented and agentic reasoning pipelines. These findings identify cache integrity as a critical yet underexplored vulnerability in current LLM deployments, positioning cache corruption as a reproducible and theoretically grounded threat model for future robustness and security research.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents. However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning, coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation, output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies, and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions (VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or annotations.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models extend vision-language models to embodied control by mapping natural-language instructions and visual observations to robot actions. Despite their capabilities, VLA systems face significant challenges due to their massive computational and memory demands, which conflict with the constraints of edge platforms such as on-board mobile manipulators that require real-time performance. Addressing this tension has become a central focus of recent research. In light of the growing efforts toward more efficient and scalable VLA systems, this survey provides a systematic review of approaches for improving VLA efficiency, with an emphasis on reducing latency, memory footprint, and training and inference costs. We categorize existing solutions into four dimensions: model architecture, perception feature, action generation, and training/inference strategies, summarizing representative techniques within each category. Finally, we discuss future trends and open challenges, highlighting directions for advancing efficient embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection. We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference throughput.

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

<title>Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective: simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone, consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity, geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Abstract: Large foundation models are fundamentally transforming the software engineering landscape, demonstrating exceptional capabilities across diverse tasks such as code generation, debugging, and testing. Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD) between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset \cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM \cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale, systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection methods in plankton recognition.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving robust and intelligent driving policies. However, existing end-to-end methods still face significant challenges, such as suboptimal decision-making in complex scenarios. In this paper,we propose SimpleVSF (Simple VLM-Scoring Fusion), a novel framework that enhances end-to-end planning by leveraging the cognitive capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and advanced trajectory fusion techniques. We utilize the conventional scorers and the novel VLM-enhanced scorers. And we leverage a robust weight fusioner for quantitative aggregation and a powerful VLM-based fusioner for qualitative, context-aware decision-making. As the leading approach in the ICCV 2025 NAVSIM v2 End-to-End Driving Challenge, our SimpleVSF framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving a superior balance between safety, comfort, and efficiency.

<title>Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Hierarchical Sparse Attention Models</title>

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context. Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and inference latency.

<title>From Pixels to People: Satellite-Based Mapping and Quantification of Riverbank Erosion and Lost Villages in Bangladesh</title>

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now, been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset - a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially, this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information, such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy, especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself. This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.

<title>D2C-HRHR: Discrete Actions with Double Distributional Critics for High-Risk-High-Return Tasks</title>

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns. Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

This paper employs a deep sparse auto-encoding network for the prediction and classification of high-frequency impedance in fuel cells, achieving metric of accuracy rate above 92\%. The network is further deployed on an FPGA, attaining a hardware-based recognition rate almost 90\%.

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval (SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings. Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically, on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP, 2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging video temporal grounding scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal continual learning, aiming to learn new tasks sequentially in multi-modal settings while preserving performance on previously learned ones. However, existing methods mainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality entanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to continuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive analysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic drift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks; 2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be confused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework is designed to address these challenges. Specifically, for multi-modal semantic drift, a Multi-modal Sample Selection (MSS) strategy is proposed to select samples with high modal consistency for rehearsal. Meanwhile, for co-occurence confusion, a Collision-based Sample Rehearsal (CSR) mechanism is designed, allowing for the increase of rehearsal sample frequency of those confusable classes during training process. Moreover, we construct three audio-visual incremental scenarios to verify effectiveness of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms single-modal continual learning methods.

Abstract: Throughout application domains, we now rely extensively on algorithmic systems to engage with ever-expanding datasets of information. Despite their benefits, these systems are often complex (comprising of many intricate tools, e.g., moderation, recommender systems, prediction models), of unknown structure (due to the lack of accompanying documentation), and having hard-to-predict yet potentially severe downstream consequences (due to the extensive use, systematic enactment of existing errors, and many comprising feedback loops). As such, understanding and evaluating these systems as a whole remains a challenge for both researchers and legislators. To aid ongoing efforts, we introduce a formal framework for such visibility allocation systems (VASs) which we define as (semi-)automated systems deciding which (processed) data to present a human user with. We review typical tools comprising VASs and define the associated computational problems they solve. By doing so, VASs can be decomposed into sub-processes and illustrated via data flow diagrams. Moreover, we survey metrics for evaluating VASs throughout the pipeline, thus aiding system diagnostics. Using forecasting-based recommendations in school choice as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can support VAS evaluation. We also discuss how our framework can support ongoing AI-legislative efforts to locate obligations, quantify systemic risks, and enable adaptive compliance.

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment, and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Understanding user behavior on the web is increasingly critical for optimizing user experience (UX). This study introduces Augmented Web Usage Mining (AWUM), a methodology designed to enhance web usage mining and improve UX by enriching the interaction data provided by CAWAL (Combined Application Log and Web Analytics), a framework for advanced web analytics. Over 1.2 million session records collected in one month (~8.5GB of data) were processed and transformed into enriched datasets. AWUM analyzes session structures, page requests, service interactions, and exit methods. Results show that 87.16% of sessions involved multiple pages, contributing 98.05% of total pageviews; 40% of users accessed various services and 50% opted for secure exits. Association rule mining revealed patterns of frequently accessed services, highlighting CAWAL's precision and efficiency over conventional methods. AWUM offers a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and strong potential for large-scale UX optimization.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity. Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice, constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal data captures complex dynamics across both space and time, yet traditional visualizations are complex, require domain expertise and often fail to resonate with broader audiences. Here, we propose MapMuse, a storytelling-based framework for interpreting spatio-temporal datasets, transforming them into compelling, narrative-driven experiences. We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.

While recent rubric-based approaches offer transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization, creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption: \textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality, query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided \textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an \textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance. Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized, fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and data-efficient path for reward modeling.

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

<title>DDSC: Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum for Data-Efficient Acoustic Scene Classification under Domain Shift</title>

Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) suffers from device-induced domain shift, especially when labels are limited. Prior work focuses on curriculum-based training schedules that structure data presentation by ordering or reweighting training examples from easy-to-hard to facilitate learning; however, existing curricula are static, fixing the ordering or the weights before training and ignoring that example difficulty and marginal utility evolve with the learned representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum (DDSC), a training schedule that adapts the curriculum online by combining two signals computed each epoch: a domain-invariance signal and a learning-progress signal. A time-varying scheduler fuses these signals into per-example weights that prioritize domain-invariant examples in early epochs and progressively emphasize device-specific cases. DDSC is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and introduces no additional inference overhead. Under the official DCASE 2024 Task~1 protocol, DDSC consistently improves cross-device performance across diverse ASC baselines and label budgets, with the largest gains on unseen-device splits.

Abstract: Deep learning approaches for heart-sound (PCG) segmentation built on time--frequency features can be accurate but often rely on large expert-labeled datasets, limiting robustness and deployment. We present TopSeg, a topological representation-centric framework that encodes PCG dynamics with multi-scale topological features and decodes them using a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) with an order- and duration-constrained inference step. To evaluate data efficiency and generalization, we train exclusively on PhysioNet 2016 dataset with subject-level subsampling and perform external validation on CirCor dataset. Under matched-capacity decoders, the topological features consistently outperform spectrogram and envelope inputs, with the largest margins at low data budgets; as a full system, TopSeg surpasses representative end-to-end baselines trained on their native inputs under the same budgets while remaining competitive at full data. Ablations at 10% training confirm that all scales contribute and that combining H_0 and H_1 yields more reliable S1/S2 localization and boundary stability. These results indicate that topology-aware representations provide a strong inductive bias for data-efficient, cross-dataset PCG segmentation, supporting practical use when labeled data are limited.

<title>Towards Mixed-Modal Retrieval for Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.

<title>Localist LLMs with Recruitment Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.17358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and principled recruitment  criteria based on penalized likelihood with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained, within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

Abstract: Robotic systems are increasingly expected to operate in human-centered, unstructured environments where safety, adaptability, and generalization are essential. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have been proposed as a language guided generalized control framework for real robots. However, their deployment has been limited to conventional serial link manipulators. Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart. Our findings highlight the necessity of finetuning for bridging embodiment gaps, and demonstrate that coupling VLA models with soft robots enables safe and flexible embodied AI in human-shared environments.

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by the original environment.

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

Abstract: Traditional approaches to inference of deterministic finite-state automata (DFA) stem from symbolic AI, including both active learning methods (e.g., Angluin's L* algorithm and its variants) and passive techniques (e.g., Biermann and Feldman's method, RPNI). Meanwhile, sub-symbolic AI, particularly machine learning, offers alternative paradigms for learning from data, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (RL). This paper investigates the use of Q-learning, a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, for the passive inference of deterministic finite automata. It builds on the core insight that the learned Q-function, which maps state-action pairs to rewards, can be reinterpreted as the transition function of a DFA over a finite domain. This provides a novel bridge between sub-symbolic learning and symbolic representations. The paper demonstrates how Q-learning can be adapted for automaton inference and provides an evaluation on several examples.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality, and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.

To address this, we present AfriCaption, a comprehensive framework for multilingual image captioning in 20 African languages and our contributions are threefold: (i) a curated dataset built on Flickr8k, featuring semantically aligned captions generated via a context-aware selection and translation process; (ii) a dynamic, context-preserving pipeline that ensures ongoing quality through model ensembling and adaptive substitution; and (iii) the AfriCaption model, a 0.5B parameter vision-to-text architecture that integrates SigLIP and NLLB200 for caption generation across under-represented languages. This unified framework ensures ongoing data quality and establishes the first scalable image-captioning resource for under-represented African languages, laying the groundwork for truly inclusive multimodal AI.

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention: interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially, this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment. Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding models that are more capable and more reliable.

Abstract: Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.

arXiv:2510.17451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The VC-dimension is a fundamental and well-studied measure of the complexity of a set system (or hypergraph) that is central to many areas of machine learning. We establish several new results on the complexity of computing the VC-dimension. In particular, given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E})$, we prove that the naive $2^{\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{V}|)}$-time algorithm is asymptotically tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We then prove that the problem admits a 1-additive fixed-parameter approximation algorithm when parameterized by the maximum degree of $\mathcal{H}$ and a fixed-parameter algorithm when parameterized by its dimension, and that these are essentially the only such exploitable structural parameters. Lastly, we consider a generalization of the problem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set systems and graphs. We show that it is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the treewidth of the graph (which, in the case of set systems, applies to the treewidth of its incidence graph). In contrast with closely related problems whose dependency on the treewidth is necessarily double-exponential (assuming the ETH), our algorithm has a relatively low dependency on the treewidth.

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios. Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular, interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition, a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level, fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift. Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\% for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld, a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient, powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and efficient training.

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). I-RAVEN-X extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

<title>Context-Aware Pseudo-Label Scoring for Zero-Shot Video Summarization</title>

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media, surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital. Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured, dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1 scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video summarization.

<title>The Graphon Limit Hypothesis: Understanding Neural Network Pruning via Infinite Width Analysis</title>

Abstract: Sparse neural networks promise efficiency, yet training them effectively remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit. Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the trainability of various sparse network architectures.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content (\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available in \href{https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V}{our webpage}.

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up. Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However, existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module, which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even when trained on limited and noisy data.

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems, constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at https://github.com/lindsayspoor/Lagrangian_SafeRL.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of planning complex manipulation tasks, in which multiple robots with different end-effectors and capabilities, informed by computer vision, must plan and execute concatenated sequences of actions on a variety of objects that can appear in arbitrary positions and configurations in unstructured scenes. We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components). We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates, while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations. We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to improved effectiveness.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Machine Learning (ML) models across multiple clients while preserving their privacy. Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex robotic manipulation tasks through imitation learning. However, existing imitation learning datasets contain only successful trajectories and lack failure or recovery data, especially for out-of-distribution (OOD) states where the robot deviates from the main policy due to minor perturbations or errors, leading VLA models to struggle with states deviating from the training distribution. To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts. We conduct extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark as well as real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating that RESample consistently improves the stability and generalization ability of VLA models.

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact 3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy usage under realistic non-IID settings.
  Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy. CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for deployment.
  To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics.
  These findings support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and lifecycle-aware systems.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections. To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks, establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs.

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space. Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in feedback-limited regimes.

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts. Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation scenarios.

Prior works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge. Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong reasoning and perception capabilities but are increasingly vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While existing work focuses on explicit attacks, where malicious content resides in a single modality, recent studies reveal implicit attacks, in which benign text and image inputs jointly express unsafe intent. Such joint-modal threats are difficult to detect and remain underexplored, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality implicit data. We propose ImpForge, an automated red-teaming pipeline that leverages reinforcement learning with tailored reward modules to generate diverse implicit samples across 14 domains. Building on this dataset, we further develop CrossGuard, an intent-aware safeguard providing robust and comprehensive defense against both explicit and implicit threats. Extensive experiments across safe and unsafe benchmarks, implicit and explicit attacks, and multiple out-of-domain settings demonstrate that CrossGuard significantly outperforms existing defenses, including advanced MLLMs and guardrails, achieving stronger security while maintaining high utility. This offers a balanced and practical solution for enhancing MLLM robustness against real-world multimodal threats.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images; however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in prior work.

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the Sim2Real performance gap.

<title>PANER: A Paraphrase-Augmented Framework for Low-Resource Named Entity Recognition</title>

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17 points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with limited NER training data and compute power.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues. Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available to foster future research.

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain signature verification.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose \textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.}, \textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/AcademicEval

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have sparse, event driven processing that can leverage neuromorphic applications. In this work, we introduce a multi-threading kernel that enables neuromorphic applications running at the edge, meaning they process sensory input directly and without any up-link to or dependency on a cloud service. The kernel shows speed-up gains over single thread processing by a factor of four on moderately sized SNNs and 1.7X on a Synfire network. Furthermore, it load-balances all cores available on multi-core processors, such as ARM, which run today's mobile devices and is up to 70% more energy efficient compared to statical core assignment. The present work can enable the development of edge applications that have low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP), and can prototype the integration of neuromorphic chips.

Abstract: As stories of human-AI interactions continue to be highlighted in the news and research platforms, the challenges are becoming more pronounced, including potential risks of overreliance, cognitive offloading, social and emotional manipulation, and the nuanced degradation of human agency and judgment. This paper surveys recent research on these issues through the lens of the psychological triad: cognition, behavior, and emotion. Observations seem to suggest that while AI can substantially enhance memory, creativity, and engagement, it also introduces risks such as diminished critical thinking, skill erosion, and increased anxiety. Emotional outcomes are similarly mixed, with AI systems showing promise for support and stress reduction, but raising concerns about dependency, inappropriate attachments, and ethical oversight. This paper aims to underscore the need for responsible and context-aware AI design, highlighting gaps for longitudinal research and grounded evaluation frameworks to balance benefits with emerging human-centric risks.

<title>Prediction of Sea Ice Velocity and Concentration in the Arctic Ocean using Physics-informed Neural Network</title>

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC). However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

<title>Towards Explainable Skin Cancer Classification: A Dual-Network Attention Model with Lesion Segmentation and Clinical Metadata Fusion</title>

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019 challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps. These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.

<title>Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale</title>

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S. president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence, we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale -- enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

Abstract: We introduce SoftMimic, a framework for learning compliant whole-body control policies for humanoid robots from example motions. Imitating human motions with reinforcement learning allows humanoids to quickly learn new skills, but existing methods incentivize stiff control that aggressively corrects deviations from a reference motion, leading to brittle and unsafe behavior when the robot encounters unexpected contacts. In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots to respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and posture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a reinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant responses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns to absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion clip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment.

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators, shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at https://github.com/zjunlp/xKG.

Abstract: As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to transform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents (General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications.

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms, which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training. Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model parameter space and better memorization.

Abstract: Self-play, a learning paradigm where agents iteratively refine their policies by interacting with historical or concurrent versions of themselves or other evolving agents, has shown remarkable success in solving complex non-cooperative multi-agent tasks. Despite its growing prominence in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), such as Go, poker, and video games, a comprehensive and structured understanding of self-play remains lacking. This survey fills this gap by offering a comprehensive roadmap to the diverse landscape of self-play methods. We begin by introducing the necessary preliminaries, including the MARL framework and basic game theory concepts. Then, it provides a unified framework and classifies existing self-play algorithms within this framework. Moreover, the paper bridges the gap between the algorithms and their practical implications by illustrating the role of self-play in different non-cooperative scenarios. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future research directions in self-play.

Abstract: Dempster-Shafer structure is effective in classical settings for connecting set-valued hypotheses and representing structured ignorance, yet its practical use is limited by combination growth over focal sets and high conflict management. We observe a mathematical consistency between Dempster-Shafer structure and quantum superposition: elements of the power set form an orthogonal basis, and a basic probability assignment can be encoded as a normalized quantum state whose amplitudes respect mass value constraints. In this paper, we implement the information fusion and correction with Dempster-Shafer structure on quantum circuits, demonstrating that belief functions provide a more concise and effective alternative to Bayesian approaches within the quantum computing framework.Furthermore, by leveraging the unique characteristics of quantum computing, we propose several novel approaches for belief transfer. More broadly, this paper introduces a novel perspective on basic information representation in quantum AI models, proposing that belief functions are better suited than Bayesian approaches for handling uncertainty in quantum circuits.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integral to the hospitality and tourism industry, concerns about their fairness in serving diverse identity groups persist. Grounded in social identity theory and sociotechnical systems theory, this study examines ethnic and gender biases in travel recommendations generated by LLMs. Using fairness probing, we analyze outputs from three leading open-source LLMs. The results show that test accuracy for both ethnicity and gender classifiers exceed random chance. Analysis of the most influential features reveals the presence of stereotype bias in LLM-generated recommendations. We also found hallucinations among these features, occurring more frequently in recommendations for minority groups. These findings indicate that LLMs exhibit ethnic and gender bias when functioning as travel planning assistants. This study underscores the need for bias mitigation strategies to improve the inclusivity and reliability of generative AI-driven travel planning assistance.

Abstract: Enabling digital humans to express rich emotions has significant applications in dialogue systems, gaming, and other interactive scenarios. While recent advances in talking head synthesis have achieved impressive results in lip synchronization, they tend to overlook the rich and dynamic nature of facial expressions. To fill this critical gap, we introduce an end-to-end text-to-expression model that explicitly focuses on emotional dynamics. Our model learns expressive facial variations in a continuous latent space and generates expressions that are diverse, fluid, and emotionally coherent. To support this task, we introduce EmoAva, a large-scale and high-quality dataset containing 15,000 text-3D expression pairs. Extensive experiments on both existing datasets and EmoAva demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, marking a significant advancement in the field.

Abstract: This paper argues that fully autonomous AI agents should not be developed. In support of this position, we build from prior scientific literature and current product marketing to delineate different AI agent levels and detail the ethical values at play in each, documenting trade-offs in potential benefits and risks. Our analysis reveals that risks to people increase with the autonomy of a system: The more control a user cedes to an AI agent, the more risks to people arise. Particularly concerning are safety risks, which affect human life and impact further values.

Abstract: Value model guided search is effective in steering LLM generation but suffers from a lack of robustness. This is due to verifier failure: imperfect VMs mistakenly prune valid reasoning paths, especially when encountering unseen reasoning paths generated during search. To address this, we propose an uncertainty-aware framework with two key components: (1) Uncertainty-Aware Value Models (UVMs), which replace single-point value estimates with value distributions to quantify prediction reliability, and (2) Group Thompson Sampling, an efficient algorithm that selects candidates based on their probability of being optimal. Experiments on two In-Distribution (ID) settings (GSM8K, MATH) and three Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) settings (e.g., AIME25, Minerva Math) show our method significantly mitigates verifier failure and boosts solution coverage, especially on OOD problems. This work provides the first systematic integration of uncertainty quantification into LLM search paradigms, enhancing robustness. The code is released at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/UVM.

Abstract: Knowledge components (KCs) mapped to problems help model student learning, tracking their mastery levels on fine-grained skills thereby facilitating personalized learning and feedback in online learning platforms. However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor intensive. We present an automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two real-world student code submission datasets in different programming languages.We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.

Abstract: In various scientific and engineering domains, where data acquisition is costly--such as in medical imaging, environmental monitoring, or remote sensing--strategic sampling from unobserved regions, guided by prior observations, is essential to maximize target discovery within a limited sampling budget. In this work, we introduce Diffusion-guided Active Target Discovery (DiffATD), a novel method that leverages diffusion dynamics for active target discovery. DiffATD maintains a belief distribution over each unobserved state in the environment, using this distribution to dynamically balance exploration-exploitation. Exploration reduces uncertainty by sampling regions with the highest expected entropy, while exploitation targets areas with the highest likelihood of discovering the target, indicated by the belief distribution and an incrementally trained reward model designed to learn the characteristics of the target. DiffATD enables efficient target discovery in a partially observable environment within a fixed sampling budget, all without relying on any prior supervised training. Furthermore, DiffATD offers interpretability, unlike existing black--box policies that require extensive supervised training. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse domains, including medical imaging, species discovery, and remote sensing, we show that DiffATD performs significantly better than baselines and competitively with supervised methods that operate under full environmental observability.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for evaluating mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs) rely primarily on competition problems, formal proofs, or artificially challenging questions -- failing to capture the nature of mathematics encountered in actual research environments. We introduce RealMath, a novel benchmark derived directly from research papers and mathematical forums that assesses LLMs' abilities on authentic mathematical tasks. Our approach addresses three critical challenges: sourcing diverse research-level content, enabling reliable automated evaluation through verifiable statements, and designing a continually refreshable dataset to mitigate contamination risks. Experimental results across multiple LLMs reveal surprising capabilities in handling research mathematics compared to competition problems, suggesting current models may already serve as valuable assistants for working mathematicians despite limitations on highly challenging problems. The code and dataset for RealMath are publicly available.

Abstract: LLM-based formal proof assistants (e.g., in Lean) hold great promise for automating mathematical discovery. But beyond syntactic correctness, do these systems truly understand mathematical structure as humans do? We investigate this question in context of mathematical inequalities -- specifically the prover's ability to recognize that the given problem simplifies by applying a known inequality such as AM/GM. Specifically, we are interested in their ability to do this in a compositional setting where multiple inequalities must be applied as part of a solution. We introduce Ineq-Comp, a benchmark built from elementary inequalities through systematic transformations, including variable duplication, algebraic rewriting, and multi-step composition. Although these problems remain easy for humans, we find that most provers -- including Goedel, STP, and Kimina-7B -- struggle significantly. DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B shows relative robustness, but still suffers a 20% performance drop (pass@32). Even for DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B model, the gap between compositional variants and seed problems exists, implying that simply scaling up the model size alone does not fully solve the compositional weakness. Strikingly, performance remains poor for all models even when formal proofs of the constituent parts are provided in context, revealing that the source of weakness is indeed in compositional reasoning. Our results expose a persisting gap between the generalization behavior of current AI provers and human mathematical intuition. All data and evaluation code can be found at https://github.com/haoyuzhao123/LeanIneqComp.

Abstract: Despite widespread adoption, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) suffer performance degradation when encountering unfamiliar queries under distribution shifts. Existing methods to improve MLLM generalization typically require either more instruction data or larger advanced model architectures, both of which incur non-trivial human labor or computational costs. In this work, we take an alternative approach to enhance the generalization and robustness of MLLMs under distribution shifts, from a representation learning perspective. Inspired by information bottleneck (IB) principle, we derive a variational lower bound of the IB for MLLMs and devise a practical implementation, Visual Instruction Bottleneck Tuning (Vittle). We then provide a theoretical justification of Vittle by revealing its connection to an information-theoretic robustness metric of MLLM. Empirical validation of multiple MLLMs on open-ended and closed-form question answering and object hallucination detection tasks over 45 datasets, including 30 shift scenarios, demonstrates that Vittle consistently improves the MLLM's robustness under shifts by pursuing the learning of a minimal sufficient representation.

Abstract: Urban traffic congestion, particularly at intersections, significantly impacts travel time, fuel consumption, and emissions. Traditional fixed-time signal control systems often lack the adaptability to manage dynamic traffic patterns effectively. This study explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize traffic signal coordination across multiple intersections within a simulated environment. Utilizing Pygame, a simulation was developed to model a network of interconnected intersections with randomly generated vehicle flows to reflect realistic traffic variability. A decentralized MARL controller was implemented, in which each traffic signal operates as an autonomous agent, making decisions based on local observations and information from neighboring agents. Performance was evaluated against a baseline fixed-time controller using metrics such as average vehicle wait time and overall throughput. The MARL approach demonstrated statistically significant improvements, including reduced average waiting times and improved throughput. These findings suggest that MARL-based dynamic control strategies hold substantial promise for improving urban traffic management efficiency. More research is recommended to address scalability and real-world implementation challenges.

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is central to artificial intelligence, with applications in education, code generation, and research-level mathematical discovery. Mathematical competitions highlight two problem types: theorem proving, requiring rigorous proofs, and answer construction, requiring creative generation and formal verification of mathematical objects. Existing research reveals that LLMs can tackle difficult answer-construction tasks but are prone to errors from hallucinations and unverifiable steps, while symbolic methods guarantee rigor but falter in creative answer construction. This raises a key understudied question: how to solve answer-construction problems while preserving both LLM creativity and mathematical rigor? To address this problem, we introduce the Enumerate-Conjecture-Prove (ECP) framework, a modular neuro-symbolic method integrating LLM-based enumeration and pattern-driven conjecturing with formal theorem proving in Lean, and ConstructiveBench, a dataset of 3,640 formal answer-construction problems from math competitions. ECP is model agnostic and shows consistent improvements over pure LLM baselines: on the subset of PutnamBench for answer construction, ECP formally solves 6 out of 337 answer-construction problems end to end (up from 4 without ECP) using GPT-5 mini and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B. On ConstructiveBench, ECP achieves 33.1% end-to-end state-of-the-art accuracy (up from 32.5%), demonstrating its potential to advance formal mathematical reasoning by combining LLM conjecturing with formal verification. Our code and dataset are publicly available at GitHub (https://github.com/sunjia72/ECP) and Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunjia72/ConstructiveBench).

<title>AgentAuditor: Human-Level Safety and Security Evaluation for LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of LLM-based agents, the reliable evaluation of their safety and security remains a significant challenge. Existing rule-based or LLM-based evaluators often miss dangers in agents' step-by-step actions, overlook subtle meanings, fail to see how small issues compound, and get confused by unclear safety or security rules. To overcome this evaluation crisis, we introduce AgentAuditor, a universal, training-free, memory-augmented reasoning framework that empowers LLM evaluators to emulate human expert evaluators. AgentAuditor constructs an experiential memory by having an LLM adaptively extract structured semantic features (e.g., scenario, risk, behavior) and generate associated chain-of-thought reasoning traces for past interactions. A multi-stage, context-aware retrieval-augmented generation process then dynamically retrieves the most relevant reasoning experiences to guide the LLM evaluator's assessment of new cases. Moreover, we developed ASSEBench, the first benchmark designed to check how well LLM-based evaluators can spot both safety risks and security threats. ASSEBench comprises 2293 meticulously annotated interaction records, covering 15 risk types across 29 application scenarios. A key feature of ASSEBench is its nuanced approach to ambiguous risk situations, employing "Strict" and "Lenient" judgment standards. Experiments demonstrate that AgentAuditor not only consistently improves the evaluation performance of LLMs across all benchmarks but also sets a new state-of-the-art in LLM-as-a-judge for agent safety and security, achieving human-level accuracy. Our work is openly accessible at https://github.com/Astarojth/AgentAuditor.

Abstract: Are world models a necessary ingredient for flexible, goal-directed behaviour, or is model-free learning sufficient? We provide a formal answer to this question, showing that any agent capable of generalizing to multi-step goal-directed tasks must have learned a predictive model of its environment. We show that this model can be extracted from the agent's policy, and that increasing the agents performance or the complexity of the goals it can achieve requires learning increasingly accurate world models. This has a number of consequences: from developing safe and general agents, to bounding agent capabilities in complex environments, and providing new algorithms for eliciting world models from agents.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents show promising capabilities for automating computer-use tasks and facilitating accessibility, but existing interactive benchmarks are mostly English-only, covering web-use or Windows, Linux, and Android environments, but not macOS. macOS is a major OS with distinctive GUI patterns and exclusive applications. To bridge the gaps, we present macOSWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating GUI agents on macOS. macOSWorld features 202 multilingual interactive tasks across 30 applications (28 macOS-exclusive), with task instructions and OS interfaces offered in 5 languages (English, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, and Russian). As GUI agents are shown to be vulnerable to deception attacks, macOSWorld also includes a dedicated safety benchmarking subset. Our evaluation on six GUI agents reveals a dramatic gap: proprietary computer-use agents lead at above 30% success rate, while open-source lightweight research models lag at below 5\%, highlighting the need for macOS domain adaptation. Multilingual benchmarks also expose common weaknesses, especially in Arabic, with a 28.8% average degradation compared to English. Results from safety benchmarking also highlight that deception attacks are more general and demand immediate attention. Project page: https://macos-world.github.io.

Abstract: Effective coordination among artificial agents in dynamic and uncertain environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches, such as self-play and population-based methods, either generalize poorly to unseen partners or require impractically extensive fine-tuning. To overcome these limitations, we propose Coordination Transformers (\coot), a novel in-context coordination framework that uses recent interaction histories to rapidly adapt to unseen partners. Unlike prior approaches that primarily aim to diversify training partners, \coot explicitly focuses on adapting to new partner behaviors by predicting actions aligned with observed interactions. Trained on trajectories collected from diverse pairs of agents with complementary preferences, \coot quickly learns effective coordination strategies without explicit supervision or parameter updates. Across diverse coordination tasks in Overcooked, \coot consistently outperforms baselines including population-based approaches, gradient-based fine-tuning, and a Meta-RL-inspired contextual adaptation method. Notably, fine-tuning proves unstable and ineffective, while Meta-RL struggles to achieve reliable coordination. By contrast, \coot achieves stable, rapid in-context adaptation and is consistently ranked the most effective collaborator in human evaluations.

Abstract: Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language models (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on benchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week, it is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or just narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20 open-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including math, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard instruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in math fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this phenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using math-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement learning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space representation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT induces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves general-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard post-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for advancing reasoning models.

Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle, and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most basic form of supervised learning. By defining two Lawvere-enriched categories corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning. We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.

Abstract: Surgical action planning requires predicting future instrument-verb-target triplets for real-time assistance. While teleoperated robotic surgery provides natural expert demonstrations for imitation learning (IL), reinforcement learning (RL) could potentially discover superior strategies through self-exploration. We present the first comprehensive comparison of IL versus RL for surgical action planning on CholecT50. Our Dual-task Autoregressive Imitation Learning (DARIL) baseline achieves 34.6% action triplet recognition mAP and 33.6% next frame prediction mAP with smooth planning degradation to 29.2% at 10-second horizons. We evaluated three RL variants: world model-based RL, direct video RL, and inverse RL enhancement. Surprisingly, all RL approaches underperformed DARIL--world model RL dropped to 3.1% mAP at 10s while direct video RL achieved only 15.9%. Our analysis reveals that distribution matching on expert-annotated test sets systematically favors IL over potentially valid RL policies that differ from training demonstrations. This challenges assumptions about RL superiority in sequential decision making and provides crucial insights for surgical AI development.

Abstract: Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI on the economy is one of society's most important questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how successfully and broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We find the most common work activities people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself is performing are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity classifications with measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve providing and communicating information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work activities performed most successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has significantly advanced the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, it struggles to break through the inherent capability boundaries of the base LLM, due to its essentially on-policy strategy coupled with LLM's immense action space and sparse reward. Critically, RLVR can lead to the capability boundary collapse, narrowing the LLM's problem-solving scope. To address this problem, we propose RL-PLUS, a novel hybrid-policy optimization approach for LLMs that synergizes internal exploitation with external data to achieve stronger reasoning capabilities and surpass the boundaries of base models. RL-PLUS integrates two core components, i.e., Multiple Importance Sampling to address distributional mismatch from external data, and Exploration-Based Advantage Function to guide the model towards high-value, unexplored reasoning paths. We provide both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of our approach. Compared with existing RLVR methods, RL-PLUS achieves 1) state-of-the-art performance on six math reasoning benchmarks; 2) superior performance on six out-of-distribution reasoning tasks; 3) consistent and significant gains across diverse model families, with average relative improvements up to 69.2\%. Moreover, the analysis of Pass@k curves indicates that RL-PLUS effectively resolves the capability boundary collapse problem.

However, position-aware sparse attention methods rely on static sparse structures that lack adaptability to diverse query contexts, while content-aware sparse attention methods depend on heuristic key-value selection, hindering full differentiability. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask sparse attention mechanism, a method that merges the advantages of both position-aware and content-aware approaches. Dynamic Mask Attention (DMA) achieves this through three key innovations: First, it leverages value vector representations to generate content-aware dynamic masks, enabling the model to adaptively identify and attend to critical information. Second, it computes position-aware sparse weights in a hardware-friendly manner, efficiently skipping unnecessary computational regions. Finally, we demonstrate that the introduced dynamic mask and sparse weights do not obstruct gradients, supporting end-to-end training. We have validated the performance of DMA through comprehensive experiments. A large body of experimental evidence shows that DMA consistently holds a Pareto advantage over state-of-the-art sparse attention baselines in tasks including scaling laws, multi-query associative recall, standard benchmarks, and needle in a haystack tests, while also delivering up to a 10x overall speedup. These results highlight its ability to effectively balance model efficiency with long-context modeling capabilities. Our computational kernel code is now open-source at https://github.com/SmallDoges/flash-dmattn to encourage further research and application by the community.

Abstract: A large amount of work has been done in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for modeling and solving problems with multiple interacting agents. However, most LLMs are pretrained independently and not specifically optimized for coordination. Existing LLM fine-tuning frameworks rely on individual rewards, which require complex reward designs for each agent to encourage collaboration. To address these challenges, we model LLM collaboration as a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem. We develop a multi-agent, multi-turn algorithm, Multi-Agent Group Relative Policy Optimization (MAGRPO), to solve it, building on current RL approaches for LLMs as well as MARL techniques. Our experiments on LLM writing and coding collaboration demonstrate that fine-tuning MAS with MAGRPO enables agents to generate high-quality responses efficiently through effective cooperation. Our approach opens the door to using other MARL methods for LLMs and highlights the associated challenges.

<title>BASIL: Bayesian Assessment of Sycophancy in LLMs</title>

Abstract: Sycophancy (overly agreeable or flattering behavior) is critical to understand in the context of human-AI collaboration, especially in decision-making settings like health, law, and education. Existing methods for studying sycophancy in LLMs are either descriptive (study behavior change when sycophancy is elicited) or normative (provide values-based judgment on behavior change). Together, these approaches help us understand the extent, and impacts, of sycophancy. However, existing normative approaches only apply for objective tasks where ground-truth data exists, ignoring the natural subjectivity in many NLP tasks.
  Drawing from behavioral economics and rational decision theory, we introduce an Bayesian framework to study the normative effects of sycophancy on rationality in LLMs, without requiring labeled ground-truth. Using this interdisciplinary framework, we study sycophantic behavior in multiple LLM baselines across three different tasks, experimenting with various methods for eliciting sycophancy and obtaining probability judgments from LLMs. We find significant evidence of sycophancy in our experiments (7 of 8 baselines for one of our probing techniques), and observe that sycophancy is more likely to reduce rationality than it is to increase rationality in LLMs' decisions when they are directly probed for probabilities (2 out of 4 baselines show significant increases overall).

Abstract: Procedural content generation often requires satisfying both designer-specified objectives and adjacency constraints implicitly imposed by the underlying tile set. To address the challenges of jointly optimizing both constraints and objectives, we reformulate WaveFunctionCollapse (WFC) as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling external optimization algorithms to focus exclusively on objective maximization while leveraging WFC's propagation mechanism to enforce constraint satisfaction. We empirically compare optimizing this MDP to traditional evolutionary approaches that jointly optimize global metrics and local tile placement. Across multiple domains with various difficulties, we find that joint optimization not only struggles as task complexity increases, but consistently underperforms relative to optimization over the WFC-MDP, underscoring the advantages of decoupling local constraint satisfaction from global objective optimization.

Abstract: The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language models (LMs), has shown a critical role in various environments that require intelligent and autonomous decision-making. Environments are not passive testing grounds, and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit in very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex, and autonomous capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of \emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal logic. In this work, we use immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make an informed root cause diagnosis, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper, reliable, and explainable diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Current AI alignment through RLHF follows a single directional paradigm that AI conforms to human preferences while treating human cognition as fixed. We propose a shift to co-alignment through Bidirectional Cognitive Alignment (BiCA), where humans and AI mutually adapt. BiCA uses learnable protocols, representation mapping, and KL-budget constraints for controlled co-evolution. In collaborative navigation, BiCA achieved 85.5% success versus 70.3% baseline, with 230% better mutual adaptation and 332% better protocol convergence. Emergent protocols outperformed handcrafted ones by 84%, while bidirectional adaptation unexpectedly improved safety (+23% out-of-distribution robustness). The 46% synergy improvement demonstrates optimal collaboration exists at the intersection, not union, of human and AI capabilities, validating the shift from single-directional to co-alignment paradigms.

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning propositional STRIPS world models from action traces alone, using a deep learning architecture (transformers) and gradient descent. The task is cast as a supervised next token prediction problem where the tokens are the actions, and an action $a$ may follow an action sequence if the hidden effects of the previous actions do not make an action precondition of $a$ false. We show that a suitable transformer architecture can faithfully represent propositional STRIPS world models, and that the models can be learned from sets of random valid (positive) and invalid (negative) action sequences alone. A number of experiments are reported.

Abstract: This paper introduces CoBRA, a novel toolkit for systematically specifying agent behavior in LLM-based social simulation. We found that conventional approaches that specify agent behaviors through implicit natural language descriptions cannot yield consistent behaviors across models, and the produced agent behaviors do not capture the nuances of the descriptions. In contrast, CoBRA presents a new approach to program agents' cognitive biases explicitly, by grounding agents' expected behaviors using classic social science experiments. CoBRA has two components: (1) Cognitive Bias Index that measures the cognitive bias of a social agent, by quantifying the agent's reactions in a set of validated classical social science experiments; (2) Behavioral Regulation Engine that aligns the agent's behavior to demonstrate controlled cognitive bias. We evaluated CoBRA as an HCI toolkit through demonstration and technical benchmarks. Our results suggest that CoBRA can precisely program the cognitive bias demonstrated in a social agent in a model-agnostic manner.

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves large language models (LLMs) on long-horizon reasoning tasks by allocating more compute at inference. LLM Inference via Tree Search (LITS) methods achieve strong performance but are highly inefficient, often running an order of magnitude slower than iterative approaches. We propose Chain-in-Tree (CiT), a plug-in framework that decides when to branch during search rather than expanding at every step. CiT introduces lightweight Branching Necessity (BN) evaluations: BN-DP (Direct Prompting), where an auxiliary LLM judges branching needs, and BN-SC (Self-Consistency), which clusters candidate actions to assess agreement. Integrated into Tree of Thoughts, ReST-MCTS, and RAP, BN-DP achieves 75-85% reductions in token generation, model calls, and runtime on GSM8K and Math500, with often negligible or no accuracy loss. BN-SC typically yields substantial savings (up to 80%) generally but shows instability in 1-4 out of 14 settings, caused by a small subset of examples that produce extremely long reasoning steps. We theoretically prove that BN-DP never increases policy invocations and release both modular LITS implementations and a lightweight CiT function applicable across all LITS variants. The full codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/xinzhel/chain_in_tree.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving, cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However, local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks: tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases, and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: \textit{Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling?} To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychCounsel-Bench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70\% accuracy to pass. PsychCounsel-Bench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs. We release the proposed dataset for public use: https://github.com/cloversjtu/PsychCounsel-Bench

Abstract: The rapid advancement of embodied intelligence and world models has intensified efforts to integrate physical laws into AI systems, yet physical perception and symbolic physics reasoning have developed along separate trajectories without a unified bridging framework. This work provides a comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine understanding of physical laws. Our synthesis envisions next-generation world models capable of explaining physical phenomena and predicting future states, advancing safe, generalizable, and interpretable AI systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories (rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters) and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade, rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation: informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet, ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and 42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

Abstract: This study investigates how to schedule nanosatellite tasks more efficiently using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In the Offline Nanosatellite Task Scheduling (ONTS) problem, the goal is to find the optimal schedule for tasks to be carried out in orbit while taking into account Quality-of-Service (QoS) considerations such as priority, minimum and maximum activation events, execution time-frames, periods, and execution windows, as well as constraints on the satellite's power resources and the complexity of energy harvesting and management. The ONTS problem has been approached using conventional mathematical formulations and exact methods, but their applicability to challenging cases of the problem is limited. This study examines the use of GNNs in this context, which has been effectively applied to optimization problems such as the traveling salesman, scheduling, and facility placement problems. More specifically, we investigate whether GNNs can learn the complex structure of the ONTS problem with respect to feasibility and optimality of candidate solutions. Furthermore, we evaluate using GNN-based heuristic solutions to provide better solutions (w.r.t. the objective value) to the ONTS problem and reduce the optimization cost. Our experiments show that GNNs are not only able to learn feasibility and optimality for instances of the ONTS problem, but they can generalize to harder instances than those seen during training. Furthermore, the GNN-based heuristics improved the expected objective value of the best solution found under the time limit in 45%, and reduced the expected time to find a feasible solution in 35%, when compared to the SCIP (Solving Constraint Integer Programs) solver in its off-the-shelf configuration

Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Abstract: Experimental and observational studies often lack validity due to untestable assumptions. We propose a double machine learning approach to combine experimental and observational studies, allowing practitioners to test for assumption violations and estimate treatment effects consistently. Our framework proposes a falsification test for external validity and ignorability under milder assumptions. We provide consistent treatment effect estimators even when one of the assumptions is violated. However, our no-free-lunch theorem highlights the necessity of accurately identifying the violated assumption for consistent treatment effect estimation. Through comparative analyses, we show our framework's superiority over existing data fusion methods. The practical utility of our approach is further exemplified by three real-world case studies, underscoring its potential for widespread application in empirical research.

Abstract: Optimization algorithms that seek flatter minima such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) are widely credited with improved generalization. We ask whether such gains impact membership privacy. Surprisingly, we find that SAM is more prone to membership inference attacks than classical SGD across multiple datasets and attack methods, despite achieving lower test error. This is an intriguing phenomenon as conventional belief posits that higher membership privacy risk is associated with poor generalization. We conjecture that SAM is capable of memorizing atypical subpatterns more, leading to better generalization but higher privacy risk. We empirically validate our hypothesis by running extensive analysis on memorization and influence scores. Finally, we theoretically show how a model that captures minority subclass features more can effectively generalize better \emph{and} have higher membership privacy risk.

Abstract: Addressing real-world optimization problems becomes particularly challenging when analytic objective functions or constraints are unavailable. While numerous studies have addressed the issue of unknown objectives, limited research has focused on scenarios where feasibility constraints are not given explicitly. Overlooking these constraints can lead to spurious solutions that are unrealistic in practice. To deal with such unknown constraints, we propose to perform optimization within the data manifold using diffusion models. To constrain the optimization process to the data manifold, we reformulate the original optimization problem as a sampling problem from the product of the Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function and the data distribution learned by the diffusion model. Depending on the differentiability of the objective function, we propose two different sampling methods. For differentiable objectives, we propose a two-stage framework that begins with a guided diffusion process for warm-up, followed by a Langevin dynamics stage for further correction. For non-differentiable objectives, we propose an iterative importance sampling strategy using the diffusion model as the proposal distribution. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic dataset, six real-world black-box optimization datasets, and a multi-objective molecule optimization dataset show that our method achieves better or comparable performance with previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: A post embedding (representation of text in embedding space that effectively captures semantic meaning) is a foundational component of LinkedIn that is consumed by product surfaces in retrieval and ranking (e.g., ranking posts in the feed or video tab). This paper presents the post embeddings used at LinkedIn, where a pre-trained transformer-based large language model (LLM) is taken as input and fine-tuned using multi-task learning across a diverse set of semantic labeling tasks. We observe positive transfer, leading to improved performance across all tasks, compared to training them independently. The generated post embeddings outperform baseline models in zero-shot learning, demonstrating its potential for broader applicability. Furthermore, the generated post embeddings' performance surpasses that of OpenAI's ADA-001 and ADA-002 embeddings on LinkedIn specific datasets and tasks. We also describe the offline evaluation methodology and the deployment to our near-line infrastructure, which makes the post embedding available for use within minutes of post creation for any downstream application. We present how the embeddings were applied in the Feed product surface, in both ranking and retrieval stages, and showcase the real world online impact to demonstrate the superior performance of these embeddings. Finally, we also share the results of applying the embeddings to the retrieval system of our video ranking product surface in LinkedIn. These embeddings have been battle-tested in production at LinkedIn for over two years, consistently powering multiple products.

<title>Predicting High-precision Depth on Low-Precision Devices Using 2D Hilbert Curves</title>

Abstract: Dense depth prediction deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved impressive results for both monocular and binocular data, but still they are limited by high computational complexity, restricting their use on low-end devices. For better on-device efficiency and hardware utilization, weights and activations of the DNN should be converted to low-bit precision. However, this precision is not sufficient to represent high dynamic range depth. In this paper, we aim to overcome this limitation and restore high-precision depth from low-bit precision predictions. To achieve this, we propose to represent high dynamic range depth as two low dynamic range components of a Hilbert curve, and to train the full-precision DNN to directly predict the latter. For on-device deployment, we use standard quantization methods and add a post-processing step that reconstructs depth from the Hilbert curve components predicted in low-bit precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method increases the bit precision of predicted depth by up to three bits with little computational overhead. We also observed a positive side effect of quantization error reduction by up to 4.6 times. Our method enables effective and accurate depth prediction with DNN weights and activations quantized to eight-bit precision.

Abstract: We prove that the combination of a target network and over-parameterized linear function approximation establishes a weaker convergence condition for bootstrapped value estimation in certain cases, even with off-policy data. Our condition is naturally satisfied for expected updates over the entire state-action space or learning with a batch of complete trajectories from episodic Markov decision processes. Notably, using only a target network or an over-parameterized model does not provide such a convergence guarantee. Additionally, we extend our results to learning with truncated trajectories, showing that convergence is achievable for all tasks with minor modifications, akin to value truncation for the final states in trajectories. Our primary result focuses on temporal difference estimation for prediction, providing high-probability value estimation error bounds and empirical analysis on Baird's counterexample and a Four-room task. Furthermore, we explore the control setting, demonstrating that similar convergence conditions apply to Q-learning.

Abstract: As pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models have become a useful tool for image synthesis, people want to specify the results in various ways. This paper tackles training-free appearance transfer, which produces an image with the structure of a target image from the appearance of a reference image. Existing methods usually do not reflect semantic correspondence, as they rely on query-key similarity within the self-attention layer to establish correspondences between images. To this end, we propose explicitly rearranging the features according to the dense semantic correspondences. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method in various aspects: preserving the structure of the target and reflecting the correct color from the reference, even when the two images are not aligned.

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) involves identifying and extracting Argumentative Components (ACs) and their corresponding Argumentative Relations (ARs). Most of the prior works have broken down these tasks into multiple sub-tasks. Existing end-to-end setups primarily use the dependency parsing approach. This work introduces a generative paradigm-based end-to-end framework argTANL. argTANL frames the argumentative structures into label-augmented text, called Augmented Natural Language (ANL). This framework jointly extracts both ACs and ARs from a given argumentative text. Additionally, this study explores the impact of Argumentative and Discourse markers on enhancing the model's performance within the proposed framework. Two distinct frameworks, Marker-Enhanced argTANL (ME-argTANL) and argTANL with specialized Marker-Based Fine-Tuning, are proposed to achieve this. Extensive experiments are conducted on three standard AM benchmarks to demonstrate the superior performance of the ME-argTANL.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks. Typically, LLMs are first pre-trained on large corpora and subsequently fine-tuned on task-specific datasets. However, during fine-tuning, LLMs may forget some knowledge acquired in the pre-training stage, leading to a decline in general capabilities. Existing approaches to mitigate forgetting often rely on access to pre-training data, which may be unavailable in many real-world scenarios--such as fine-tuning checkpoint-only open-source LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a new fine-tuning algorithm termed Momentum-Filtered Optimizer (MoFO). MoFO is an extension of greedy block coordinate descent (BCD) methods: in each iteration, MoFO only updates the model parameters with the largest momentum magnitudes, while keeping all other parameters fixed. MoFO achieves similar fine-tuning performance to the default fine-tuning algorithm while effectively mitigating knowledge forgetting. We validate MoFO through rigorous convergence analysis and extensive experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating forgetting without pre-training data.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have emerged as a powerful technique for learning representations from user-item interaction data in collaborative filtering (CF) for recommender systems. However, many existing methods heavily rely on unique user and item IDs, which restricts their performance in zero-shot learning scenarios. Inspired by the success of language models (LMs) and their robust generalization capabilities, we pose the question: How can we leverage language models to enhance recommender systems? We propose EasyRec, an effective approach that integrates text-based semantic understanding with collaborative signals. EasyRec employs a text-behavior alignment framework that combines contrastive learning with collaborative language model tuning. This ensures strong alignment between text-enhanced semantic representations and collaborative behavior information. Extensive evaluations across diverse datasets show EasyRec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in text-based zero-shot recommendation. EasyRec functions as a plug-and-play component that integrates seamlessly into collaborative filtering frameworks. This empowers existing systems with improved performance and adaptability to user preferences. Implementation codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyRec.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) improves large language models (LMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge through evidence retrieved from external sources. However, it often struggles to cope with inconsistent and irrelevant information that can distract the LM from its tasks, especially when multiple evidence pieces are required. While compressing the retrieved evidence with a compression model aims to address this issue, the compressed evidence may still be unfamiliar to the target model used for downstream tasks, potentially failing to utilize the evidence effectively. We propose FaviComp (Familarity-Aware Evidence Compression), a novel training-free evidence compression technique that makes retrieved evidence more familiar to the target model, while seamlessly integrating parametric knowledge from the model. Experimental results show that FaviComp consistently outperforms most recent evidence compression baselines across multiple open-domain QA datasets, improving accuracy by up to 28.1% while achieving high compression rates. Additionally, we demonstrate the effective integration of both parametric and non-parametric knowledge during evidence compression.

<title>Packet Inspection Transformer: A Self-Supervised Journey to Unseen Malware Detection with Few Samples</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18219</link>

arXiv:2409.18219v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As networks continue to expand and become more interconnected, the need for novel malware detection methods becomes more pronounced. Traditional security measures are increasingly inadequate against the sophistication of modern cyber attacks. Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) has been pivotal in enhancing network security, offering an in-depth analysis of network traffic that surpasses conventional monitoring techniques. DPI not only examines the metadata of network packets, but also dives into the actual content being carried within the packet payloads, providing a comprehensive view of the data flowing through networks. While the integration of advanced deep learning techniques with DPI has introduced modern methodologies into malware detection and network traffic classification, state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches are limited by their reliance on large amounts of annotated data and their inability to generalize to novel, unseen malware threats. To address these limitations, this paper leverages the recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL) and few-shot learning (FSL). Our proposed self-supervised approach trains a transformer via SSL to learn the embedding of packet content, including payload, from vast amounts of unlabeled data by masking portions of packets, leading to a learned representation that generalizes to various downstream tasks. Once the representation is extracted from the packets, they are used to train a malware detection algorithm. The representation obtained from the transformer is then used to adapt the malware detector to novel types of attacks using few-shot learning approaches. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves classification accuracies of up to 94.76% on the UNSW-NB15 dataset and 83.25% on the CIC-IoT23 dataset.

Abstract: Classical reinforcement learning (RL) typically assumes rational decision-making based on expected utility theory. However, this model has been shown to be empirically inconsistent with actual human preferences, as evidenced in psychology and behavioral economics. Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) provides a more nuanced model for human-based decision-making, capturing diverse attitudes and perceptions toward risk, gains, and losses. While prior work has integrated CPT with RL to solve CPT policy optimization problems, the understanding and impact of this formulation remain limited. Our contributions are as follows: (a) we derive a novel policy gradient theorem for CPT objectives, generalizing the foundational result in standard RL, (b) we design a model-free policy gradient algorithm for solving the CPT-RL problem, (c) we analyze our policy gradient estimator and prove asymptotic convergence of the algorithm to first-order stationary points, and (d) test its performance through simulations. Notably, our first-order policy gradient algorithm scales better than existing zeroth-order methods to larger state spaces. Our theoretical framework offers more flexibility to advance the integration of behavioral decision-making into RL.

<title>Beyond Uncertainty Quantification: Learning Uncertainty for Trust-Informed Neural Network Decisions - A Case Study in COVID-19 Classification</title>

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical in high-stakes applications, such as medical diagnosis, where confidently incorrect predictions can erode trust in automated decision-making systems. Traditional uncertainty quantification methods rely on a predefined confidence threshold to classify predictions as confident or uncertain. However, this approach assumes that predictions exceeding the threshold are trustworthy, while those below it are uncertain, without explicitly assessing the correctness of high-confidence predictions. As a result, confidently incorrect predictions may still occur, leading to misleading uncertainty assessments. To address this limitation, this study proposed an uncertainty-aware stacked neural network, which extends conventional uncertainty quantification by learning when predictions should be trusted. The framework consists of a two-tier model: the base model generates predictions with uncertainty estimates, while the meta-model learns to assign a trust flag, distinguishing confidently correct cases from those requiring expert review. The proposed approach is evaluated against the traditional threshold-based method across multiple confidence thresholds and pre-trained architectures using the COVIDx CXR-4 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces confidently incorrect predictions, offering a more trustworthy and efficient decision-support system for high-stakes domains.

<title>Simplicity Prevails: Rethinking Negative Preference Optimization for LLM Unlearning</title>

arXiv:2410.07163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the problem of large language model (LLM) unlearning, aiming to remove unwanted data influences (e.g., copyrighted or harmful content) while preserving model utility. Despite the increasing demand for unlearning, a technically-grounded optimization framework is lacking. Gradient ascent (GA)-type methods, though widely used, are suboptimal as they reverse the learning process without controlling optimization divergence (i.e., deviation from the pre-trained state), leading to risks of over-forgetting and potential model collapse. Negative preference optimization (NPO) has been proposed to address this issue and is considered one of the state-of-the-art LLM unlearning approaches. In this work, we revisit NPO and identify another critical issue: reference model bias. This bias arises from using the reference model (i.e., the model prior to unlearning) to evaluate the unlearning success, which can compromise NPO's effectiveness. Specifically, it leads to (a) uneven allocation of optimization power across forget data with varying difficulty levels and (b) ineffective gradient weight smoothing during the early stages of unlearning optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective unlearning optimization framework, called SimNPO, showing that `simplicity' in removing the reliance on a reference model (through the lens of simple preference optimization) benefits unlearning. We provide deeper insights into SimNPO's advantages through an analysis based on mixtures of Markov chains. Extensive experiments further validate SimNPO's efficacy on benchmarks like TOFU and MUSE, as well as its robustness against relearning attacks. Codes are available at https://github.com/OPTML-Group/Unlearn-Simple.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned for a specific downstream task. The most common fine-tuning method is to update pretrained weights via low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Existing initialization strategies for LoRA often rely on singular value decompositions (SVD) of gradients or weight matrices. However, they do not provably maximize the expected gradient signal, which is critical for fast adaptation. To this end, we introduce Explained Variance Adaptation (EVA), an initialization scheme that uses the directions capturing the most activation variance, provably maximizing the expected gradient signal and accelerating fine-tuning. EVA performs incremental SVD on minibatches of activation vectors and selects the right-singular vectors for initialization once they converged. Further, by selecting the directions that capture the most activation-variance for a given rank budget, EVA accommodates adaptive ranks that reduce the number of trainable parameters. We apply EVA to a variety of fine-tuning tasks as language generation and understanding, image classification, and reinforcement learning. EVA exhibits faster convergence than competitors and achieves the highest average score across a multitude of tasks per domain while reducing the number of trainable parameters through rank redistribution. In summary, EVA establishes a new Pareto frontier compared to existing LoRA initialization schemes in both accuracy and efficiency.

arXiv:2410.10807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge or specifications of input-output relationships into machine learning models has attracted significant attention, as it enhances generalization from limited data and yields conforming outputs. However, most existing approaches use soft constraints by penalizing violations through regularization, which offers no guarantee of constraint satisfaction, especially on inputs far from the training distribution--an essential requirement in safety-critical applications. On the other hand, imposing hard constraints on neural networks may hinder their representational power, adversely affecting performance. To address this, we propose HardNet, a practical framework for constructing neural networks that inherently satisfy hard constraints without sacrificing model capacity. Unlike approaches that modify outputs only at inference time, HardNet enables end-to-end training with hard constraint guarantees, leading to improved performance. To the best of our knowledge, HardNet is the first method that enables efficient and differentiable enforcement of more than one input-dependent inequality constraint. It allows unconstrained optimization of the network parameters using standard algorithms by appending a differentiable closed-form enforcement layer to the network's output. Furthermore, we show that HardNet retains neural networks' universal approximation capabilities. We demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness across various applications: learning with piecewise constraints, learning optimization solvers with guaranteed feasibility, and optimizing control policies in safety-critical systems.

Abstract: Osteoporosis is a common condition that increases fracture risk, especially in older adults. Early diagnosis is vital for preventing fractures, reducing treatment costs, and preserving mobility. However, healthcare providers face challenges like limited labeled data and difficulties in processing medical images. This study presents a novel multi-modal learning framework that integrates clinical and imaging data to improve diagnostic accuracy and model interpretability. The model utilizes three pre-trained networks-VGG19, InceptionV3, and ResNet50-to extract deep features from X-ray images. These features are transformed using PCA to reduce dimensionality and focus on the most relevant components. A clustering-based selection process identifies the most representative components, which are then combined with preprocessed clinical data and processed through a fully connected network (FCN) for final classification. A feature importance plot highlights key variables, showing that Medical History, BMI, and Height were the main contributors, emphasizing the significance of patient-specific data. While imaging features were valuable, they had lower importance, indicating that clinical data are crucial for accurate predictions. This framework promotes precise and interpretable predictions, enhancing transparency and building trust in AI-driven diagnoses for clinical integration.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based Agents have been applied to fix bugs automatically, demonstrating the capability in addressing software defects by engaging in development environment interaction, iterative validation and code modification. However, systematic analysis of these agent systems remain limited, particularly regarding performance variations among top-performing ones. In this paper, we examine six repair systems on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark for automated bug fixing. We first assess each system's overall performance, noting the instances solvable by all or none of these systems, and explore the capabilities of different systems. We also compare fault localization accuracy at file and code symbol levels and evaluate bug reproduction capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that further optimization is needed in both the LLM capability itself and the design of Agentic flow to improve the effectiveness of the Agent in bug fixing.

Abstract: The urban environment is characterized by complex spatio-temporal dynamics arising from diverse human activities and interactions. Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems. In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scales up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format; 2) With task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanDiT.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of language models (LMs) has caused a huge surge in demand for GPUs. Training large LMs requires tens of thousands of GPUs and housing them in the same datacenter (DC) is a challenge due to many constraints including availability of peak power. We focus on training such models across multiple DCs connected via the Wide-Area-Network (WAN). We built Atlas that speeds up the training time using novel workload-aware temporal bandwidth sharing and other design choices. While Atlas improves the training time, it does not completely eliminate the bubbles (idle GPU cycles). We built BubbleTea that runs prefill-as-a-service (part of LM inference) during the bubbles thus improving the GPU utilization without any impact on training. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, Atlas and BubbleTea together achieve up to 17x faster training, and up to 94% GPU utilization. The code will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks for text-to-video (T2V) synthesis. However, achieving accurate text alignment in T2V generation remains challenging due to the complex temporal dependencies across frames. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches to enhance text alignment often require differentiable reward functions trained for videos, hindering their scalability and applicability. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Free$^2$Guide}, a novel gradient-free and training-free framework for aligning generated videos with text prompts. Specifically, leveraging principles from path integral control, Free$^2$Guide approximates guidance for diffusion models using non-differentiable reward functions, thereby enabling the integration of powerful black-box Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) as reward models. To enable image-trained LVLMs to assess text-to-video alignment, we leverage \textit{stitching} between video frames and use system prompts to capture sequential attributions. Our framework supports the flexible ensembling of multiple reward models to synergistically enhance alignment without significant computational overhead. Experimental results confirm that Free$^2$Guide using image-trained LVLMs significantly improves text-to-video alignment, thereby enhancing the overall video quality. Our results and code are available at https://kjm981995.github.io/free2guide/

Abstract: The alignment of pre-trained LLMs continues to draw significant attention from both industry and academia, aiming to ensure responses that are helpful, harmless, and honest. However, identifying a point in the model's representation subspace that simultaneously satisfies all these properties remains challenging. H3Fusion addresses this challenge by introducing a mixture-of-experts (MoE)-based fusion mechanism that models alignment as a controllable drift within the subspace, guided by a drift-regularization loss to balance competing alignment dimensions. Furthermore, we formulate the alignment by finding a dual objective of harnessing the distance of generated embeddings and alignment embeddings, and introduce a gating loss by canalizing the activations on the contributing experts. Extensive evaluations of three benchmark datasets show that H3Fusion is more helpful, less harmful, and more honest in three aspects: it outperforms each individually aligned model by 11.37%, and provides stronger robustness compared to the state-of-the-art LLM ensemble approaches by 13.77% and model-merging approaches by 6.18%.

Abstract: The exponential growth of large-scale telescope arrays has boosted time-domain astronomy development but introduced operational bottlenecks, including labor-intensive observation planning, data processing, and real-time decision-making. Here we present the StarWhisper Telescope system, an AI agent framework automating end-to-end astronomical observations for surveys like the Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey. By integrating large language models with specialized function calls and modular workflows, StarWhisper Telescope autonomously generates site-specific observation lists, executes real-time image analysis via pipelines, and dynamically triggers follow-up proposals upon transient detection. The system reduces human intervention through automated observation planning, telescope controlling and data processing, while enabling seamless collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers. Deployed across Nearby Galaxy Supernovae Survey's network of 10 amateur telescopes, the StarWhisper Telescope has detected transients with promising response times relative to existing surveys. Furthermore, StarWhisper Telescope's scalable agent architecture provides a blueprint for future facilities like the Global Open Transient Telescope Array, where AI-driven autonomy will be critical for managing 60 telescopes.

<title>Tracing Partisan Bias to Its Emotional Fingerprints: A Computational Approach to Mitigation</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework for analysing and mitigating media bias by tracing partisan stances to their linguistic roots in emotional language. We posit that partisan bias is not merely an abstract stance but materialises as quantifiable 'emotional fingerprints' within news texts. These fingerprints are systematically measured using the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) framework, allowing us to decode the affective strategies behind partisan framing. Our analysis of the Allsides dataset confirms this hypothesis, revealing distinct and statistically significant emotional fingerprints for left, centre, and right-leaning media. Based on this evidence-driven approach, we then propose a computational approach to mitigation through NeutraSum, a model designed to neutralise these identified emotional patterns. By explicitly targeting the VAD characteristics of biased language, NeutraSum generates summaries that are not only coherent but also demonstrably closer to an emotionally neutral baseline. Experimental results validate our framework: NeutraSum successfully erases the partisan emotional fingerprints from its summaries, achieving a demonstrably lower emotional bias score than other models. This work pioneers a new path for bias mitigation, shifting the focus from treating symptoms (political labels) to addressing the cause: the emotional encoding of partisan bias in language.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in text generation, yet their emotional consistency and semantic coherence in social media contexts remain insufficiently understood. This study investigates how LLMs handle emotional content and maintain semantic relationships through continuation and response tasks using three open-source models: Gemma, Llama3 and Llama3.3 and one commercial Model:Claude. By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic consistency between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: these models show a strong tendency to moderate negative emotions. When the input text carries negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, or sadness, LLM tends to generate content with more neutral emotions, or even convert them into positive emotions such as joy or surprise. At the same time, we compared the LLM-generated content with human-authored content. The four models systematically generated responses with reduced emotional intensity and showed a preference for neutral rational emotions in the response task. In addition, these models all maintained a high semantic similarity with the original text, although their performance in the continuation task and the response task was different. These findings provide deep insights into the emotion and semantic processing capabilities of LLM, which are of great significance for its deployment in social media environments and human-computer interaction design.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.

Abstract: Robot sports, characterized by well-defined objectives, explicit rules, and dynamic interactions, present ideal scenarios for demonstrating embodied intelligence. In this paper, we present VolleyBots, a novel robot sports testbed where multiple drones cooperate and compete in the sport of volleyball under physical dynamics. VolleyBots integrates three features within a unified platform: competitive and cooperative gameplay, turn-based interaction structure, and agile 3D maneuvering. These intertwined features yield a complex problem combining motion control and strategic play, with no available expert demonstrations. We provide a comprehensive suite of tasks ranging from single-drone drills to multi-drone cooperative and competitive tasks, accompanied by baseline evaluations of representative reinforcement learning (RL), multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and game-theoretic algorithms. Simulation results show that on-policy RL methods outperform off-policy methods in single-agent tasks, but both approaches struggle in complex tasks that combine motion control and strategic play. We additionally design a hierarchical policy which achieves 69.5% win rate against the strongest baseline in the 3 vs 3 task, demonstrating its potential for tackling the complex interplay between low-level control and high-level strategy. To highlight VolleyBots' sim-to-real potential, we further demonstrate the zero-shot deployment of a policy trained entirely in simulation on real-world drones.

<title>Harmony in Divergence: Towards Fast, Accurate, and Memory-efficient Zeroth-order LLM Fine-tuning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across various tasks, but standard first-order (FO) fine-tuning demands considerable memory, significantly limiting real-world deployment. Recently, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization stood out as a promising memory-efficient training paradigm, avoiding backward passes and relying solely on forward passes for gradient estimation, making it attractive for resource-constrained scenarios. However, ZO method lags far behind FO method in both convergence speed and accuracy. To bridge the gap, we introduce a novel layer-wise divergence analysis that uncovers the distinct update pattern of FO and ZO optimization. Aiming to resemble the learning capacity of FO method from the findings, we propose Divergence-driven Zeroth-Order (DiZO) optimization. DiZO conducts divergence-driven layer adaptation by incorporating projections to ZO updates, generating diverse-magnitude updates precisely scaled to layer-wise individual optimization needs. Our results demonstrate that DiZO significantly reduces the needed iterations for convergence without sacrificing throughput, cutting training GPU hours by up to 48\% on various datasets. Moreover, DiZO consistently outperforms the representative ZO baselines in fine-tuning RoBERTa-large, OPT-series, and Llama-series on downstream tasks and, in some cases, even surpasses memory-intensive FO fine-tuning. Our code is released at https://github.com/Skilteee/DiZO.

Abstract: Action recognition in dark or low-light (under-exposed) videos is a challenging task due to visibility degradation, which can hinder critical spatiotemporal details. This paper proposes ActLumos, a teacher-student framework that attains single-stream inference while retaining multi-stream level accuracy. The teacher consumes dual stream inputs, which include original dark frames and retinex-enhanced frames, processed by weight-shared R(2+1)D-34 backbones and fused by a Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, which dynamically re-weights the two streams at each time step, emphasising the most informative temporal segments. The teacher is also included with a supervised contrastive loss (SupCon) that sharpens class margins. The student shares the R(2+1)D-34 backbone but uses only dark frames and no fusion at test time. The student is first pre-trained with self-supervision on dark clips of both datasets without their labels and then fine-tuned with knowledge distillation from the teacher, transferring the teacher's multi-stream knowledge into a single-stream model. Under single-stream inference, the distilled student attains state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.92% (Top-1) on ARID V1.0, 88.27% on ARID V1.5, and 48.96% on Dark48. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each component, i.e., DFF in the teacher outperforms single or static fusion, knowledge distillation (KD) transfers these gains to the single-stream student, and two-view spatio-temporal SSL surpasses spatial-only or temporal-only variants without increasing inference cost.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, we typically refer to unsupervised pre-training when we aim to pre-train a policy without a priori access to the task specification, i.e. rewards, to be later employed for efficient learning of downstream tasks. In single-agent settings, the problem has been extensively studied and mostly understood. A popular approach, called task-agnostic exploration, casts the unsupervised objective as maximizing the entropy of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy, from which principles and methods follow.
  In contrast, little is known about it in multi-agent settings, which are ubiquitous in the real world. What are the pros and cons of alternative problem formulations in this setting? How hard is the problem in theory, how can we solve it in practice? In this paper, we address these questions by first characterizing those alternative formulations and highlighting how the problem, even when tractable in theory, is non-trivial in practice. Then, we present a scalable, decentralized, trust-region policy search algorithm to address the problem in practical settings. Finally, we provide numerical validations to both corroborate the theoretical findings and pave the way for unsupervised multi-agent reinforcement learning via task-agnostic exploration in challenging domains, showing that optimizing for a specific objective, namely mixture entropy, provides an excellent trade-off between tractability and performances.

Abstract: Humans possess an extraordinary ability to understand and execute complex manipulation tasks by interpreting abstract instruction manuals. For robots, however, this capability remains a substantial challenge, as they cannot interpret abstract instructions and translate them into executable actions. In this paper, we present Manual2Skill, a novel framework that enables robots to perform complex assembly tasks guided by high-level manual instructions. Our approach leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to extract structured information from instructional images and then uses this information to construct hierarchical assembly graphs. These graphs represent parts, subassemblies, and the relationships between them. To facilitate task execution, a pose estimation model predicts the relative 6D poses of components at each assembly step. At the same time, a motion planning module generates actionable sequences for real-world robotic implementation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Manual2Skill by successfully assembling several real-world IKEA furniture items. This application highlights its ability to manage long-horizon manipulation tasks with both efficiency and precision, significantly enhancing the practicality of robot learning from instruction manuals. This work marks a step forward in advancing robotic systems capable of understanding and executing complex manipulation tasks in a manner akin to human capabilities.Project Page: https://owensun2004.github.io/Furniture-Assembly-Web/

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates inference in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple draft tokens simultaneously. However, existing methods often struggle with token misalignment between the training and decoding phases, limiting their performance. To address this, we propose GRIFFIN, a novel framework that incorporates a token-alignable training strategy and a token-alignable draft model to mitigate misalignment. The training strategy employs a loss masking mechanism to exclude highly misaligned tokens during training, preventing them from negatively impacting the draft model's optimization. The token-alignable draft model introduces input tokens to correct inconsistencies in generated features. Experiments on LLaMA, Vicuna, Qwen and Mixtral models demonstrate that GRIFFIN achieves an average acceptance length improvement of over 8% and a speedup ratio exceeding 7%, outperforming current speculative decoding state-of-the-art methods. Our code and GRIFFIN's draft models are released publicly in https://github.com/hsj576/GRIFFIN.

Abstract: Accurate 3D shape representation is essential in engineering applications such as design, optimization, and simulation. In practice, engineering workflows require structured, part-based representations, as objects are inherently designed as assemblies of distinct components. However, most existing methods either model shapes holistically or decompose them without predefined part structures, limiting their applicability in real-world design tasks. We propose PartSDF, a supervised implicit representation framework that explicitly models composite shapes with independent, controllable parts while maintaining shape consistency. Thanks to its simple but innovative architecture, PartSDF outperforms both supervised and unsupervised baselines in reconstruction and generation tasks. We further demonstrate its effectiveness as a structured shape prior for engineering applications, enabling precise control over individual components while preserving overall coherence.

Abstract: Scaling up executable code data is significant for improving language models' software engineering capability. The intricate nature of the process makes it labor-intensive, time-consuming and expert-knowledge-dependent to build a large number of executable code repositories, limiting the scalability of existing work based on running tests. The primary bottleneck lies in the automated building of test environments for different repositories, which is an essential yet underexplored task. To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test environments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code repository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based on the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the entire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be used to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We created a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for evaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.

Abstract: Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) has demonstrated great effectiveness in identifying unusual patterns within graph-structured data. However, while labeled anomalies are often scarce in emerging applications, existing supervised GAD approaches are either ineffective or not applicable when moved across graph domains due to distribution shifts and heterogeneous feature spaces. To address these challenges, we present GADT3, a novel test-time training framework for cross-domain GAD. GADT3 combines supervised and self-supervised learning during training while adapting to a new domain during test time using only self-supervised learning by leveraging a homophily-based affinity score that captures domain-invariant properties of anomalies. Our framework introduces four key innovations to cross-domain GAD: an effective self-supervision scheme, an attention-based mechanism that dynamically learns edge importance weights during message passing, domain-specific encoders for handling heterogeneous features, and class-aware regularization to address imbalance. Experiments across multiple cross-domain settings demonstrate that GADT3 significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving average improvements of over 8.2\% in AUROC and AUPRC compared to the best competing model.

Abstract: Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer considerable potential for clinical prediction, but their complexity and heterogeneity present significant challenges for traditional machine learning methods. Recently, domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large volumes of unlabeled EHR data have shown improved predictive accuracy and generalization. However, their development is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets, and inconsistencies in coding standards and clinical practices. In this study, we explore the use of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode EHR into high-dimensional representations for downstream clinical prediction tasks. We convert structured EHR data into Markdown-formatted plain-text documents by replacing medical codes with natural language descriptions. This enables the use of LLMs and their extensive semantic understanding and generalization capabilities as effective encoders of EHRs without requiring access to private medical training data. We show that LLM-based embeddings can often match or even surpass the performance of a specialized EHR foundation model, CLMBR-T-Base, across 15 diverse clinical tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark. Critically, our approach requires no institution-specific training and can incorporate any medical code with a text description, whereas existing EHR foundation models operate on fixed vocabularies and can only process codes seen during pretraining. To demonstrate generalizability, we further evaluate the approach on the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, out-of-domain for CLMBR-T-Base, whose fixed vocabulary covers only 16% of UKB codes. Notably, an LLM-based model achieves superior performance for prediction of disease onset, hospitalization, and mortality, indicating robustness to population and coding shifts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various tasks but remain prone to hallucinations. Detecting hallucinations is essential for safety-critical applications, and recent methods leverage attention map properties to this end, though their effectiveness remains limited. In this work, we investigate the spectral features of attention maps by interpreting them as adjacency matrices of graph structures. We propose the $\text{LapEigvals}$ method, which utilises the top-$k$ eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from the attention maps as an input to hallucination detection probes. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art hallucination detection performance among attention-based methods. Extensive ablation studies further highlight the robustness and generalisation of $\text{LapEigvals}$, paving the way for future advancements in the hallucination detection domain.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for LLM alignment and reasoning, but existing policy-based methods, such as PPO and DPO, can fall short of fixing shortcuts inherited from pre-training. In this work, we introduce $Q\sharp$, a value-based algorithm for KL-regularized RL that guides the reference policy using the optimal regularized $Q$ function. We propose to learn the optimal $Q$ function using distributional RL on an aggregated online dataset. Unlike prior value-based baselines that guide the model using unregularized $Q$-values, our method is theoretically principled and provably learns the optimal policy for the KL-regularized RL problem. Empirically, $Q\sharp$ outperforms prior baselines in math reasoning benchmarks while maintaining a smaller KL divergence to the reference policy. Theoretically, we establish a reduction from KL-regularized RL to no-regret online learning, providing the first bounds for deterministic MDPs under only realizability. Thanks to distributional RL, our bounds are also variance-dependent and converge faster when the reference policy has small variance. In sum, our results highlight $Q\sharp$ as an effective approach for post-training LLMs, offering both improved performance and theoretical guarantees. The code can be found at https://github.com/jinpz/q_sharp.

Abstract: Practical control systems pose significant challenges in identifying optimal control policies due to uncertainties in the system model and external disturbances. While $H_\infty$ control techniques are commonly used to design robust controllers that mitigate the effects of disturbances, these methods often require complex and computationally intensive calculations. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reinforcement learning algorithm called robust deterministic policy gradient (RDPG), which formulates the $H_\infty$ control problem as a two-player zero-sum dynamic game. In this formulation, one player (the user) aims to minimize the cost, while the other player (the adversary) seeks to maximize it. We then employ deterministic policy gradient (DPG) and its deep reinforcement learning counterpart to train a robust control policy with effective disturbance attenuation. In particular, for practical implementation, we introduce an algorithm called robust deep deterministic policy gradient (RDDPG), which employs a deep neural network architecture and integrates techniques from the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) to enhance stability and learning efficiency. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, we implement it on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasked with following a predefined path in a disturbance-prone environment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other control approaches in terms of robustness against disturbances, enabling precise real-time tracking of moving targets even under severe disturbance conditions.

Abstract: Histopathology and transcriptomics are fundamental modalities in oncology, encapsulating the morphological and molecular aspects of the disease. Multi-modal self-supervised learning has demonstrated remarkable potential in learning pathological representations by integrating diverse data sources. Conventional multi-modal integration methods primarily emphasize modality alignment, while paying insufficient attention to retaining the modality-specific structures. However, unlike conventional scenarios where multi-modal inputs share highly overlapping features, histopathology and transcriptomics exhibit pronounced heterogeneity, offering orthogonal yet complementary insights. Histopathology provides morphological and spatial context, elucidating tissue architecture and cellular topology, whereas transcriptomics delineates molecular signatures through gene expression patterns. This inherent disparity introduces a major challenge in aligning them while maintaining modality-specific fidelity. To address these challenges, we present MIRROR, a novel multi-modal representation learning method designed to foster both modality alignment and retention. MIRROR employs dedicated encoders to extract comprehensive features for each modality, which is further complemented by a modality alignment module to achieve seamless integration between phenotype patterns and molecular profiles. Furthermore, a modality retention module safeguards unique attributes from each modality, while a style clustering module mitigates redundancy and enhances disease-relevant information by modeling and aligning consistent pathological signatures within a clustering space. Extensive evaluations on TCGA cohorts for cancer subtyping and survival analysis highlight MIRROR's superior performance, demonstrating its effectiveness in constructing comprehensive oncological feature representations and benefiting the cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has shown effectiveness in improving sequential recommendation models. However, existing methods still face challenges in generating high-quality contrastive pairs: they either rely on random perturbations that corrupt user preference patterns or depend on sparse collaborative data that generates unreliable contrastive pairs. Furthermore, existing approaches typically require predefined selection rules that impose strong assumptions, limiting the model's ability to autonomously learn optimal contrastive pairs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named Semantic Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Learning (SRA-CL). SRA-CL leverages the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to generate expressive embeddings that capture both user preferences and item characteristics. These semantic embeddings enable the construction of candidate pools for inter-user and intra-user contrastive learning through semantic-based retrieval. To further enhance the quality of the contrastive samples, we introduce a learnable sample synthesizer that optimizes the contrastive sample generation process during model training. SRA-CL adopts a plug-and-play design, enabling seamless integration with existing sequential recommendation architectures. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and model-agnostic nature of our approach.

Abstract: In green security, defenders must forecast adversarial behavior, such as poaching, illegal logging, and illegal fishing, to plan effective patrols. These behavior are often highly uncertain and complex. Prior work has leveraged game theory to design robust patrol strategies to handle uncertainty, but existing adversarial behavior models primarily rely on Gaussian processes or linear models, which lack the expressiveness needed to capture intricate behavioral patterns. To address this limitation, we propose a conditional diffusion model for adversary behavior modeling, leveraging its strong distribution-fitting capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models in the green security domain. Integrating diffusion models into game-theoretic optimization, however, presents new challenges, including a constrained mixed strategy space and the need to sample from an unnormalized distribution to estimate utilities. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a mixed strategy of mixed strategies and employ a twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampler for accurate sampling. Theoretically, our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to an epsilon equilibrium with high probability using a finite number of iterations and samples. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world poaching datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced automated ECG interpretation, they still face two key limitations: (1) insufficient multimodal synergy between time series signals and visual ECG representations, and (2) limited explainability in linking diagnoses to granular waveform evidence. We introduce GEM, the first MLLM unifying ECG time series, 12-lead ECG images and text for grounded and clinician-aligned ECG interpretation. GEM enables feature-grounded analysis, evidence-driven reasoning, and a clinician-like diagnostic process through three core innovations: a dual-encoder framework extracting complementary time series and image features, cross-modal alignment for effective multimodal understanding, and knowledge-guided instruction generation for generating high-granularity grounding data (ECG-Grounding) linking diagnoses to measurable parameters ($e.g.$, QRS/PR Intervals). Additionally, we propose the Grounded ECG Understanding task, a clinically motivated benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the MLLM's capability in grounded ECG understanding. Experimental results on both existing and our proposed benchmarks show GEM significantly improves predictive performance (CSN $7.4\% \uparrow$), explainability ($22.7\% \uparrow$), and grounding ($24.8\% \uparrow$), making it more suitable for real-world clinical applications.

<title>Late Fusion and Multi-Level Fission Amplify Cross-Modal Transfer in Text-Speech LMs</title>

Abstract: Text-Speech Language Models (TSLMs) -- language models trained to jointly process and generate text and speech -- are commonly trained through an early modality fusion/fission approach, in which both modalities are fed and predicted from a shared backbone via linear layers. We hypothesize that this approach limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality -- specifically, the finer-grained nature of speech representations compared to text -- preventing the emergence of a shared feature hierarchy within model layers. In this paper, we argue that this limitation can be addressed through late fusion and fission, with a fission process that accesses both high- and low-level features for speech generation. Our models implementing these principles, SmolTolk, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute, and achieve significantly improved cross-modal performance relative to early fusion/fission baselines. Representation analyses further suggest that our method enhances the model's ability to abstract higher-level, more semantic features from speech, and leads to increasingly shared representation spaces across layers.

Abstract: Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is among the most popular neighbor embedding methods. The method relies on attractive and repulsive forces among high-dimensional data points to obtain a low-dimensional embedding. In this paper, we analyze the forces to reveal their effects on cluster formations and visualization and compare UMAP to its contemporaries. Repulsion emphasizes differences, controlling cluster boundaries and inter-cluster distance. Attraction is more subtle, as attractive tension between points can manifest simultaneously as attraction and repulsion in the lower-dimensional mapping. This explains the need for learning rate annealing and motivates the different treatments between attractive and repulsive terms. Moreover, by modifying attraction, we improve the consistency of cluster formation under random initialization. Overall, our analysis makes UMAP and similar embedding methods more interpretable, more robust, and more accurate.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Grok-3, have attracted widespread attention for their remarkable capabilities in multimodal data understanding. Meanwhile, the rapid expansion of information services has led to a growing demand for AI-enabled wireless networks. The open-source DeepSeek models are famous for their innovative designs, such as large-scale pure RL and cost-efficient training, which make them well-suited for practical deployment in wireless networks. By integrating DeepSeek-style LLMs with wireless infrastructures, a synergistic opportunity arises: the DeepSeek-style LLMs enhance network optimization with strong reasoning and decision-making abilities, while wireless infrastructure enables the broad deployment of these models. Motivated by this convergence, this survey presents a comprehensive DeepSeek-inspired exploration of RL-based LLMs in the context of wireless networks. We begin by reviewing key techniques behind network optimization to establish a foundation for understanding DeepSeek-style LLM integration. Next, we examine recent advancements in RL-based LLMs, using DeepSeek models as a representative example. Building on this, we explore the synergy between the two domains, highlighting motivations, challenges, and potential solutions. Finally, we highlight emerging directions for integrating LLMs with wireless networks, such as quantum, on-device, and neural-symbolic LLM models, as well as embodied AI agents. Overall, this survey offers a comprehensive examination of the interplay between DeepSeek-style LLMs and wireless networks, demonstrating how these domains can mutually enhance each other to drive innovation.

<title>Provably Efficient Reward Transfer in Reinforcement Learning with Discrete Markov Decision Processes</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new solution to reward adaptation (RA) in reinforcement learning, where the agent adapts to a target reward function based on one or more existing source behaviors learned a priori under the same domain dynamics but different reward functions. While learning the target behavior from scratch is possible, it is often inefficient given the available source behaviors. Our work introduces a new approach to RA through the manipulation of Q-functions. Assuming the target reward function is a known function of the source reward functions, we compute bounds on the Q-function and present an iterative process (akin to value iteration) to tighten these bounds. Such bounds enable action pruning in the target domain before learning even starts. We refer to this method as "Q-Manipulation" (Q-M). The iteration process assumes access to a lite-model, which is easy to provide or learn. We formally prove that Q-M, under discrete domains, does not affect the optimality of the returned policy and show that it is provably efficient in terms of sample complexity in a probabilistic sense. Q-M is evaluated in a variety of synthetic and simulation domains to demonstrate its effectiveness, generalizability, and practicality.

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning framework and annotation methodology for the automatic detection of periodontal bone loss landmarks, associated conditions, and staging. 192 periapical radiographs were collected and annotated with a stage agnostic methodology, labelling clinically relevant landmarks regardless of disease presence or extent. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries using an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture keypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation models were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing improved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but reduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by -0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary segmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model. Periodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal Dice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened periodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive samples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set performance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with balanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The PRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics, while the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible predictions with occasional catastrophic failures. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of clinically interpretable periodontal bone loss assessment, with potential to reduce diagnostic variability and clinician workload.

<title>Jasmine: Harnessing Diffusion Prior for Self-supervised Depth Estimation</title>

arXiv:2503.15905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Jasmine, the first Stable Diffusion (SD)-based self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation, which effectively harnesses SD's visual priors to enhance the sharpness and generalization of unsupervised prediction. Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

<title>Unseen from Seen: Rewriting Observation-Instruction Using Foundation Models for Augmenting Vision-Language Navigation</title>

Abstract: Data scarcity is a long-standing challenge in the Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) field, which extremely hinders the generalization of agents to unseen environments. Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

<title>When To Solve, When To Verify: Compute-Optimal Problem Solving and Generative Verification for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute has emerged as a key strategy for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly in tasks like mathematical problem-solving. A traditional approach, Self-Consistency (SC), generates multiple solutions to a problem and selects the most common answer via majority voting. Another common method involves scoring each solution with a reward model (verifier) and choosing the best one. Recent advancements in Generative Reward Models (GenRM) reframe verification as a next-token prediction task, enabling inference-time scaling along a new axis. Specifically, GenRM generates multiple verification chains-of-thought to score each solution. Under a limited inference budget, this introduces a fundamental trade-off: should you spend the budget on scaling solutions via SC or generate fewer solutions and allocate compute to verification via GenRM? To address this, we evaluate GenRM against SC under a fixed inference budget. Interestingly, we find that SC is more compute-efficient than GenRM for most practical inference budgets across diverse models and datasets. For instance, GenRM first matches SC after consuming up to 8x the inference compute and requires significantly more compute to outperform it. Furthermore, we derive inference scaling laws for the GenRM paradigm, revealing that compute-optimal inference favors scaling solution generation more aggressively than scaling the number of verifications. Our work provides practical guidance on optimizing test-time scaling by balancing solution generation and verification. The code is available at https://github.com/nishadsinghi/sc-genrm-scaling.

Abstract: Link prediction in graph data uses various algorithms and Graph Nerual Network (GNN) models to predict potential relationships between graph nodes. These techniques have found widespread use in numerous real-world applications, including recommendation systems, community/social networks, and biological structures. However, recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of GNN models to adversarial attacks, such as poisoning and evasion attacks. Addressing the vulnerability of GNN models is crucial to ensure stable and robust performance in GNN applications. Although many works have focused on enhancing the robustness of node classification on GNN models, the robustness of link prediction has received less attention. To bridge this gap, this article introduces an unweighted graph poisoning attack that leverages meta-learning with weighted scheme strategies to degrade the link prediction performance of GNNs. We conducted comprehensive experiments on diverse datasets across multiple link prediction applications to evaluate the proposed method and its parameters, comparing it with existing approaches under similar conditions. Our results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces link prediction performance and consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Dominance is a fundamental concept in game theory. In strategic-form games dominated strategies can be identified in polynomial time. As a consequence, iterative removal of dominated strategies can be performed efficiently as a preprocessing step for reducing the size of a game before computing a Nash equilibrium. For imperfect-information games in extensive form, we could convert the game to strategic form and then iteratively remove dominated strategies in the same way; however, this conversion may cause an exponential blowup in game size. In this paper we define and study the concept of dominated actions in imperfect-information games. Our main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether an action is dominated (strictly or weakly) by any mixed strategy in n-player games, which can be extended to an algorithm for iteratively removing dominated actions. This allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the game tree as a preprocessing step for Nash equilibrium computation. We explore the role of dominated actions empirically in the "All In or Fold" No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker variant.

Abstract: Clinical case reports encode temporal patient trajectories that are often underexploited by traditional machine learning methods relying on structured data. In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.

arXiv:2504.11558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Error Broadcast and Decorrelation (EBD), a novel learning framework for neural networks that addresses credit assignment by directly broadcasting output errors to individual layers, circumventing weight transport of backpropagation. EBD is rigorously grounded in the stochastic orthogonality property of Minimum Mean Square Error estimators. This fundamental principle states that the error of an optimal estimator is orthogonal to functions of the input. Guided by this insight, EBD defines layerwise loss functions that directly penalize correlations between layer activations and output errors, thereby establishing a principled foundation for error broadcasting. This theoretically sound mechanism naturally leads to the experimentally observed three-factor learning rule and integrates with biologically plausible frameworks to enhance performance and plausibility. Numerical experiments demonstrate EBD's competitive or better performance against other error-broadcast methods on benchmark datasets. Our findings establish EBD as an efficient, biologically plausible, and principled alternative for neural network training. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/meterdogan07/error-broadcast-decorrelation.

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of content on social media platforms, analyzing and comprehending online discourse has become increasingly complex. This paper introduces LLMTaxo, a novel framework leveraging large language models for the automated construction of taxonomies of factual claims from social media by generating topics at multiple levels of granularity. The resulting hierarchical structure significantly reduces redundancy and improves information accessibility. We also propose dedicated taxonomy evaluation metrics to enable comprehensive assessment. Evaluations conducted on three diverse datasets demonstrate LLMTaxo's effectiveness in producing clear, coherent, and comprehensive taxonomies. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4o mini consistently outperforms others across most metrics. The framework's flexibility and low reliance on manual intervention underscore its potential for broad applicability.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However, they generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to fail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements and require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack fine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based evaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and (2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation report is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding scenarios and 23 programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance among three baselines for evaluating complex code generation, outperforming the best baseline with average improvements of 0.217, 0.163, and 0.141 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://github.com/Eshe0922/CodeVisionary.

Abstract: The Black-Litterman model addresses the sensitivity issues of tra- ditional mean-variance optimization by incorporating investor views, but systematically generating these views remains a key challenge. This study proposes and validates a systematic frame- work that translates return forecasts and predictive uncertainty from Large Language Models (LLMs) into the core inputs for the Black-Litterman model: investor views and their confidence lev- els. Through a backtest on S&amp;P 500 constituents, we demonstrate that portfolios driven by top-performing LLMs significantly out- perform traditional baselines in both absolute and risk-adjusted terms. Crucially, our analysis reveals that each LLM exhibits a dis- tinct and consistent investment style which is the primary driver of performance. We found that the selection of an LLM is therefore not a search for a single best forecaster, but a strategic choice of an investment style whose success is contingent on its alignment with the prevailing market regime.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained widespread adoption across diverse applications due to their impressive generative capabilities. Their plug-and-play nature enables both developers and end users to interact with these models through simple prompts. However, as LLMs become more integrated into various systems in diverse domains, concerns around their security are growing. Existing studies mainly focus on threats arising from user prompts (e.g. prompt injection attack) and model output (e.g. model inversion attack), while the security of system prompts remains largely overlooked. This work bridges the critical gap. We introduce system prompt poisoning, a new attack vector against LLMs that, unlike traditional user prompt injection, poisons system prompts hence persistently impacts all subsequent user interactions and model responses. We systematically investigate four practical attack strategies in various poisoning scenarios. Through demonstration on both generative and reasoning LLMs, we show that system prompt poisoning is highly feasible without requiring jailbreak techniques, and effective across a wide range of tasks, including those in mathematics, coding, logical reasoning, and natural language processing. Importantly, our findings reveal that the attack remains effective even when user prompts employ advanced prompting techniques like chain-of-thought (CoT). We also show that such techniques, including CoT and retrieval-augmentation-generation (RAG), which are proven to be effective for improving LLM performance in a wide range of tasks, are significantly weakened in their effectiveness by system prompt poisoning.

Abstract: Conformal prediction quantifies the uncertainty of machine learning models by augmenting point predictions with valid prediction sets. For complex scenarios involving multiple trials, models, or data sources, conformal prediction sets can be aggregated to create a prediction set that captures the overall uncertainty, often improving precision. However, aggregating multiple prediction sets with individual $1-\alpha$ coverage inevitably weakens the overall guarantee, typically resulting in $1-2\alpha$ worst-case coverage. In this work, we propose a framework for the weighted aggregation of prediction sets, where weights are assigned to each prediction set based on their contribution. Our framework offers flexible control over how the sets are aggregated, achieving tighter coverage bounds that interpolate between the $1-2\alpha$ guarantee of the combined models and the $1-\alpha$ guarantee of an individual model depending on the distribution of weights. Importantly, our framework generalizes to data-dependent weights, as we derive a procedure for weighted aggregation that maintains finite-sample validity even when the weights depend on the data. This extension makes our framework broadly applicable to settings where weights are learned, such as mixture-of-experts (MoE), and we demonstrate through experiments in the MoE setting that our methods achieve adaptive coverage.

<title>Intrinsic Self-Correction in LLMs: Towards Explainable Prompting via Mechanistic Interpretability</title>

Abstract: Intrinsic self-correction refers to the phenomenon where a language model refines its own outputs purely through prompting, without external feedback or parameter updates. While this approach improves performance across diverse tasks, its internal mechanism remains poorly understood. We analyze intrinsic self-correction from a representation-level perspective. We formalize and introduce the notion of a prompt-induced shift, which is the change in hidden representations caused by a self-correction prompt. Across 5 open-source LLMs, prompt-induced shifts in text detoxification and text toxification align with latent directions constructed from contrastive pairs. In detoxification, the shifts align with the non-toxic direction; in toxification, they align with the toxic direction. These results suggest that intrinsic self-correction functions as representation steering along interpretable latent directions, beyond what standard metrics such as task scores or model confidence capture. Our analysis offers an interpretability-based account of intrinsic self-correction and contributes to a more systematic understanding of LLM prompting.

<title>PsyMem: Fine-grained psychological alignment and Explicit Memory Control for Advanced Role-Playing LLMs</title>

arXiv:2505.12814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing LLM-based role-playing methods often rely on superficial textual descriptions or simplistic metrics, inadequately modeling both intrinsic and extrinsic character dimensions. Additionally, they typically simulate character memory with implicit model knowledge or basic retrieval augment generation without explicit memory alignment, compromising memory consistency. The two issues weaken reliability of role-playing LLMs in several applications, such as trustworthy social simulation. To address these limitations, we propose PsyMem, a novel framework integrating fine-grained psychological attributes and explicit memory control for role-playing. PsyMem supplements textual descriptions with 26 psychological indicators to detailed model character. Additionally, PsyMem implements memory alignment training, explicitly trains the model to align character's response with memory, thereby enabling dynamic memory-controlled responding during inference. By training Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on our specially designed dataset (including 5,414 characters and 38,962 dialogues extracted from novels), the resulting model, termed as PsyMem-Qwen, outperforms baseline models in role-playing, achieving the best performance in human-likeness and character fidelity.

Abstract: Despite growing empirical evidence of bias amplification in machine learning, its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. We develop a formal framework for majority-minority learning tasks, showing how standard training can favor majority groups and produce stereotypical predictors that neglect minority-specific features. Assuming population and variance imbalance, our analysis reveals three key findings: (i) the close proximity between ``full-data'' and stereotypical predictors, (ii) the dominance of a region where training the entire model tends to merely learn the majority traits, and (iii) a lower bound on the additional training required. Our results are illustrated through experiments in deep learning for tabular and image classification tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generative capabilities but remain prone to inconsistencies and hallucinations. We introduce Peer Elicitation Games (PEG), a training-free, game-theoretic framework for aligning LLMs through a peer elicitation mechanism involving a generator and multiple discriminators instantiated from distinct base models. Discriminators interact in a peer evaluation setting, where utilities are computed using a determinant-based mutual information score that provably incentivizes truthful reporting without requiring ground-truth labels. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that each agent, via online learning, achieves sublinear regret in the sense their cumulative performance approaches that of the best fixed truthful strategy in hindsight. Moreover, we prove last-iterate convergence to a truthful Nash equilibrium, ensuring that the actual policies used by agents converge to stable and truthful behavior over time. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in factual accuracy. These results position PEG as a practical approach for eliciting truthful behavior from LLMs without supervision or fine-tuning.

<title>Hard Negatives, Hard Lessons: Revisiting Training Data Quality for Robust Information Retrieval with LLMs</title>

arXiv:2505.16967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training robust retrieval and reranker models typically relies on large-scale retrieval datasets; for example, the BGE collection contains 1.6 million query-passage pairs sourced from various data sources. However, we find that certain datasets can negatively impact model effectiveness -- pruning 8 out of 15 datasets from the BGE collection, reduces the training set size by 2.35$\times$, surprisingly increases nDCG@10 on BEIR by 1.0 point. This motivates a deeper examination of training data quality, with a particular focus on "false negatives", where relevant passages are incorrectly labeled as irrelevant. We utilize LLMs as a simple, cost-effective approach to identify and relabel false negatives in training datasets. Experimental results show that relabeling false negatives as true positives improves both E5 (base) and Qwen2.5-7B retrieval models by 0.7$\unicode{x2013}$1.4 points on BEIR and by 1.7$\unicode{x2013}$1.8 points at nDCG@10 on zero-shot AIR-Bench evaluation. Similar gains are observed for rerankers fine-tuned on the relabeled data, such as Qwen2.5-3B on BEIR. The reliability of LLMs to identify false negatives is supported by human annotation results. Our training dataset and code are publicly available.

<title>Understanding Prompt Tuning and In-Context Learning via Meta-Learning</title>

Abstract: Prompting is one of the main ways to adapt a pretrained model to target tasks. Besides manually constructing prompts, many prompt optimization methods have been proposed in the literature. Method development is mainly empirically driven, with less emphasis on a conceptual understanding of prompting. In this paper we discuss how optimal prompting can be understood through a Bayesian view, which also implies some fundamental limitations of prompting that can only be overcome by tuning weights. The paper explains in detail how meta-trained neural networks behave as Bayesian predictors over the pretraining distribution, whose hallmark feature is rapid in-context adaptation. Optimal prompting can be studied formally as conditioning these Bayesian predictors, yielding criteria for target tasks where optimal prompting is and is not possible. We support the theory with educational experiments on LSTMs and Transformers, where we compare different versions of prefix-tuning and different weight-tuning methods. We also confirm that soft prefixes, which are sequences of real-valued vectors outside the token alphabet, can lead to very effective prompts for trained and even untrained networks by manipulating activations in ways that are not achievable by hard tokens. This adds an important mechanistic aspect beyond the conceptual Bayesian theory.

Abstract: Class-imbalanced learning (CIL) on tabular data is important in many real-world applications where the minority class holds the critical but rare outcomes. In this paper, we present CLIMB, a comprehensive benchmark for class-imbalanced learning on tabular data. CLIMB includes 73 real-world datasets across diverse domains and imbalance levels, along with unified implementations of 29 representative CIL algorithms. Built on a high-quality open-source Python package with unified API designs, detailed documentation, and rigorous code quality controls, CLIMB supports easy implementation and comparison between different CIL algorithms. Through extensive experiments, we provide practical insights on method accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the limitations of naive rebalancing, the effectiveness of ensembles, and the importance of data quality.

<title>Towards Evaluating Proactive Risk Awareness of Multimodal Language Models</title>

Abstract: Human safety awareness gaps often prevent the timely recognition of everyday risks. In solving this problem, a proactive safety artificial intelligence (AI) system would work better than a reactive one. Instead of just reacting to users' questions, it would actively watch people's behavior and their environment to detect potential dangers in advance. Our Proactive Safety Bench (PaSBench) evaluates this capability through 416 multimodal scenarios (128 image sequences, 288 text logs) spanning 5 safety-critical domains. Evaluation of 36 advanced models reveals fundamental limitations: Top performers like Gemini-2.5-pro achieve 71% image and 64% text accuracy, but miss 45-55% risks in repeated trials. Through failure analysis, we identify unstable proactive reasoning rather than knowledge deficits as the primary limitation. This work establishes (1) a proactive safety benchmark, (2) systematic evidence of model limitations, and (3) critical directions for developing reliable protective AI. We believe our dataset and findings can promote the development of safer AI assistants that actively prevent harm rather than merely respond to requests. Our dataset can be found at https://huggingface.co/datasets/Youliang/PaSBench.

<title>CrossRF: A Domain-Invariant Deep Learning Approach for RF Fingerprinting</title>

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone identification and security, although it suffers from significant performance degradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to 99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only 26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels 1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it particularly suitable for practical drone security applications.

arXiv:2505.18601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human-generated reward signals are critical for aligning generative models with human preferences, guiding both training and inference-time evaluations. While large language models (LLMs) employed as proxy evaluators, i.e., LLM-as-a-Judge, significantly reduce the costs associated with manual annotations, they typically require extensive modality-specific training data and fail to generalize well across diverse multimodal tasks. In this paper, we propose Flex-Judge, a reasoning-guided multimodal judge model that leverages minimal textual reasoning data to robustly generalize across multiple modalities and evaluation formats. Our core intuition is that structured textual reasoning explanations inherently encode generalizable decision-making patterns, enabling an effective transfer to multimodal judgments, e.g., with images or videos. Empirical results demonstrate that Flex-Judge, despite being trained on significantly fewer text data, achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art commercial APIs and extensively trained multimodal evaluators. Notably, Flex-Judge presents broad impact in modalities like molecule, where comprehensive evaluation benchmarks are scarce, underscoring its practical value in resource-constrained domains. Our framework highlights reasoning-based text supervision as a powerful, cost-effective alternative to traditional annotation-intensive approaches, substantially advancing scalable multimodal model-as-a-judge.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent substantial intellectual and economic investments, yet their effectiveness can inadvertently facilitate model imitation via knowledge distillation (KD). In practical scenarios, competitors can distill proprietary LLM capabilities by simply observing publicly accessible outputs, akin to reverse-engineering a complex performance by observation alone. Existing protective methods like watermarking only identify imitation post-hoc, while other defenses assume the student model mimics the teacher's internal logits, rendering them ineffective against distillation purely from observed output text. This paper confronts the challenge of actively protecting LLMs within the realistic constraints of API-based access. We introduce an effective and efficient Defensive Output Generation (DOGe) strategy that subtly modifies the output behavior of an LLM. Its outputs are accurate and useful for legitimate users, yet are designed to be misleading for distillation, significantly undermining imitation attempts. We achieve this by fine-tuning only the final linear layer of the teacher LLM with an adversarial loss. This targeted training approach anticipates and disrupts distillation attempts during inference time. Our experiments show that, while preserving the performance of the teacher model, student models distilled from the defensively generated outputs demonstrate catastrophically reduced performance, demonstrating DOGe as a practical safeguard against KD-based model imitation.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) across industries has increased the demand for high-quality and customizable outputs. However, traditional alignment methods often require retraining large pretrained models, making it difficult to quickly adapt and optimize LLMs for diverse applications. To address this limitation, we propose a novel \textit{Residual Alignment Model} (\textit{RAM}) that formalizes the alignment process as a type of importance sampling. In this framework, the unaligned upstream model serves as the proposal distribution, while the alignment process is framed as secondary sampling based on an autoregressive alignment module that acts as an estimator of the importance weights. This design enables a natural detachment of the alignment module from the target aligned model, improving flexibility and scalability. Based on this model, we derive an efficient sequence-level training strategy for the alignment module, which operates independently of the proposal module. Additionally, we develop a resampling algorithm with iterative token-level decoding to address the common first-token latency issue in comparable methods. Experimental evaluations on two leading open-source LLMs across diverse tasks, including instruction following, domain adaptation, and preference optimization, demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baseline models.

Abstract: Sparse-reward reinforcement learning (RL) can model a wide range of highly complex tasks. Solving sparse-reward tasks is RL's core premise, requiring efficient exploration coupled with long-horizon credit assignment, and overcoming these challenges is key for building self-improving agents with superhuman ability. Prior work commonly explores with the objective of solving many sparse-reward tasks, making exploration of individual high-dimensional, long-horizon tasks intractable. We argue that solving such challenging tasks requires solving simpler tasks that are relevant to the target task, i.e., whose achieval will teach the agent skills required for solving the target task. We demonstrate that this sense of direction, necessary for effective exploration, can be extracted from existing RL algorithms, without leveraging any prior information. To this end, we propose a method for directed sparse-reward goal-conditioned very long-horizon RL (DISCOVER), which selects exploratory goals in the direction of the target task. We connect DISCOVER to principled exploration in bandits, formally bounding the time until the target task becomes achievable in terms of the agent's initial distance to the target, but independent of the volume of the space of all tasks. We then perform a thorough evaluation in high-dimensional environments. We find that the directed goal selection of DISCOVER solves exploration problems that are beyond the reach of prior state-of-the-art exploration methods in RL.

Abstract: The high inference demands of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) pose substantial challenges in their deployment. To this end, we introduce Neural Block Linearization (NBL), a novel framework for accelerating transformer model inference by replacing self-attention layers with linear approximations derived from Linear Minimum Mean Squared Error estimators. NBL leverages Canonical Correlation Analysis to compute a theoretical upper bound on the approximation error. Then, we use this bound as a criterion for substitution, selecting the LLM layers with the lowest linearization error. NBL can be efficiently applied to pre-trained LLMs without the need for fine-tuning. In experiments, NBL achieves notable computational speed-ups while preserving competitive accuracy on multiple reasoning benchmarks. For instance, applying NBL to 12 self-attention layers in DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B increases the inference speed by 32% with less than 1% accuracy trade-off, making it a flexible and promising solution to improve the inference efficiency of LLMs. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/NBL.

Abstract: Interactive Theorem Proving was repeatedly shown to be fruitful combined with Generative Artificial Intelligence. This paper assesses multiple approaches to Rocq generation and illuminates potential avenues for improvement.

The evaluation of the designed approach shows up to 28% relative increase of the generator's performance. We tackle the problem of writing Rocq proofs using a multi-stage agentic system, tailored for formal verification, and demonstrate its high effectiveness. We conduct an ablation study and demonstrate shows that incorporating multi-agent debate during the planning stage increases the proof success rate by 20% overall and nearly doubles it for complex theorems, while the reflection mechanism further enhances stability and consistency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment -- offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs' benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current benchmarks often focus on only individual components rather than providing a holistic evaluation framework of all tasks. In this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code, specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves a 61.4\% code correctness rate, 51.0\% for specification soundness and completeness, and a mere 3.6\% proof success rate (based on one trial per task). We hope Verina will catalyze progress in verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark. We release our dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunblaze-ucb/verina and our evaluation code on https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/verina.

It provides over 100 data generators and verifiers spanning multiple domains including algebra, arithmetic, computation, cognition, geometry, graph theory, logic, and various common games. Its key innovation is the ability to generate virtually infinite training data with adjustable complexity, unlike most previous reasoning datasets, which are typically fixed. This procedural generation approach allows for continuous evaluation across varying difficulty levels. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of RG in both evaluating and reinforcement learning of reasoning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on single-answer multiple-choice tasks, yet many real-world problems require identifying all correct answers from a set of options. This capability remains underexplored. We introduce SATA-BENCH, the first dedicated benchmark for evaluating LLMs on Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges: selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in realistic, multi-answer applications.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue, often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes, limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern. Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6% and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1% in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with correct answers.

<title>CoVoMix2: Advancing Zero-Shot Dialogue Generation with Fully Non-Autoregressive Flow Matching</title>

Abstract: Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency, model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment, and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably, CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech generation scenarios.

Abstract: Recent strides in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced their performance in many reasoning tasks. However, Abstract Visual Reasoning (AVR) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to limitations in perceiving abstract graphics. To tackle this issue, we investigate the bottlenecks in current MLLMs and synthesize training data to improve their abstract visual perception. First, we propose VisuRiddles, a benchmark for AVR, featuring tasks meticulously constructed to assess models' reasoning capacities across five core dimensions and two high-level reasoning categories. Second, we introduce the Perceptual Riddle Synthesizer (PRS), an automated framework for generating riddles with fine-grained perceptual descriptions. PRS not only generates valuable training data for abstract graphics but also provides fine-grained perceptual description, crucially allowing for supervision over intermediate reasoning stages and thereby improving both training efficacy and model interpretability. Our extensive experimental results on VisuRiddles empirically validate that fine-grained visual perception is the principal bottleneck and our synthesis framework markedly enhances the performance of contemporary MLLMs on these challenging tasks. Our code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yh-hust/VisuRiddles

Abstract: Automated parsing of scanned documents into richly structured, machine-readable formats remains a critical bottleneck in Document AI, as traditional multi-stage pipelines suffer from error propagation and limited adaptability to diverse layouts. We introduce layoutRL, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that trains models to be explicitly layout-aware by optimizing a composite reward of normalized edit distance, paragraph count accuracy, and reading order preservation. Leveraging our newly released dataset, Infinity-Doc-55K, which combines 55K high-fidelity synthetic scanned document parsing data with expert-filtered real-world documents, we instantiate layoutRL in a vision-language-model-based parser called Infinity-Parser. Evaluated on English and Chinese benchmarks for OCR, table and formula extraction, and reading order detection, Infinity-Parser achieves new state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and structural fidelity, outpacing specialist pipelines and general-purpose vision-language models. We will publicly release our code and dataset to accelerate progress in robust document understanding.

Abstract: Spatial referring is a fundamental capability of embodied robots to interact with the 3D physical world. However, even with the powerful pretrained vision language models (VLMs), recent approaches are still not qualified to accurately understand the complex 3D scenes and dynamically reason about the instruction-indicated locations for interaction. To this end, we propose RoboRefer, a 3D-aware VLM that can first achieve precise spatial understanding by integrating a disentangled but dedicated depth encoder via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Moreover, RoboRefer advances generalized multi-step spatial reasoning via reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), with metric-sensitive process reward functions tailored for spatial referring tasks. To support SFT and RFT training, we introduce RefSpatial, a large-scale dataset of 20M QA pairs (2x prior), covering 31 spatial relations (vs. 15 prior) and supporting complex reasoning processes (up to 5 steps). In addition, we introduce RefSpatial-Bench, a challenging benchmark filling the gap in evaluating spatial referring with multi-step reasoning. Experiments show that SFT-trained RoboRefer achieves state-of-the-art spatial understanding, with an average success rate of 89.6%. RFT-trained RoboRefer further outperforms all other baselines by a large margin, even surpassing Gemini-2.5-Pro by 17.4% in average accuracy on RefSpatial-Bench. Notably, RoboRefer can be integrated with various control policies to execute long-horizon, dynamic tasks across diverse robots (e,g., UR5, G1 humanoid) in cluttered real-world scenes.

Abstract: Emerging Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) consistently excel in mathematical and reasoning tasks, showcasing remarkable capabilities. However, the enhancement of reasoning abilities and the exposure of internal reasoning processes introduce new safety vulnerabilities. A critical question arises: when reasoning becomes intertwined with harmfulness, will LRMs become more vulnerable to jailbreaks in reasoning mode? To investigate this, we introduce HauntAttack, a novel and general-purpose black-box adversarial attack framework that systematically embeds harmful instructions into reasoning questions. Specifically, we modify key reasoning conditions in existing questions with harmful instructions, thereby constructing a reasoning pathway that guides the model step by step toward unsafe outputs. We evaluate HauntAttack on 11 LRMs and observe an average attack success rate of 70\%, achieving up to 12 percentage points of absolute improvement over the strongest prior baseline. Our further analysis reveals that even advanced safety-aligned models remain highly susceptible to reasoning-based attacks, offering insights into the urgent challenge of balancing reasoning capability and safety in future model development.

Abstract: Inference in dynamic probabilistic models is a complex task involving expensive operations. In particular, for Hidden Markov Models, the whole state space has to be enumerated for advancing in time. Even states with negligible probabilities are considered, resulting in computational inefficiency and increased noise due to the propagation of unlikely probability mass. We propose to denoise the future and speed up inference by using only the top-p states, i.e., the most probable states with accumulated probability p. We show that the error introduced by using only the top-p states is bound by p and the so-called minimal mixing rate of the underlying model. Moreover, in our empirical evaluation, we show that we can expect speedups of at least an order of magnitude, while the error in terms of total variation distance is below 0.09.

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.

Abstract: Physiological signals are often corrupted by motion artifacts, baseline drift, and other low-SNR disturbances, which pose significant challenges for analysis. Additionally, these signals exhibit strong non-stationarity, with sharp peaks and abrupt changes that evolve continuously, making them difficult to represent using traditional time-domain or filtering methods. To address these issues, a novel wavelet-based approach for physiological signal analysis is presented, aiming to capture multi-scale time-frequency features in various physiological signals. Leveraging this technique, two large-scale pretrained models specific to EMG and ECG are introduced for the first time, achieving superior performance and setting new baselines in downstream tasks. Additionally, a unified multi-modal framework is constructed by integrating pretrained EEG model, where each modality is guided through its dedicated branch and fused via learnable weighted fusion. This design effectively addresses challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio, high inter-subject variability, and device mismatch, outperforming existing methods on multi-modal tasks. The proposed wavelet-based architecture lays a solid foundation for analysis of diverse physiological signals, while the multi-modal design points to next-generation physiological signal processing with potential impact on wearable health monitoring, clinical diagnostics, and broader biomedical applications.

<title>Every Rollout Counts: Optimal Resource Allocation for Efficient Test-Time Scaling</title>

arXiv:2506.15707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional inference-time computation to explore multiple reasoning paths through search. Yet how to allocate a fixed rollout budget most effectively during search remains underexplored, often resulting in inefficient use of compute at test time. To bridge this gap, we formulate test-time search as a resource allocation problem and derive the optimal allocation strategy that maximizes the probability of obtaining a correct solution under a fixed rollout budget. Within this formulation, we reveal a core limitation of existing search methods: solution-level allocation tends to favor reasoning directions with more candidates, leading to theoretically suboptimal and inefficient use of compute. To address this, we propose Direction-Oriented Resource Allocation (DORA), a provably optimal method that mitigates this bias by decoupling direction quality from candidate count and allocating resources at the direction level. To demonstrate DORA's effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks including MATH500, AIME2024, and AIME2025. The empirical results show that DORA consistently outperforms strong baselines with comparable computational cost, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. We hope our findings contribute to a broader understanding of optimal TTS for LLMs.

Abstract: The advent of artificial intelligence has propelled AI-Generated Game Commentary (AI-GGC) into a rapidly expanding field, offering benefits such as unlimited availability and personalized narration. However, current researches in this area remain fragmented, and a comprehensive survey that systematically unifies existing efforts is still missing. To bridge this gap, our survey introduces a unified framework that systematically organizes the AI-GGC landscape. We present a novel taxonomy focused on three core commentator capabilities: Live Observation, Strategic Analysis, and Historical Recall. Commentary is further categorized into three functional types: Descriptive, Analytical, and Background. Building on this structure, we provide an in-depth review of state-of-the-art methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics across various game genres. Finally, we highlight key challenges such as real-time reasoning, multimodal integration, and evaluation bottlenecks, and outline promising directions for future research and system development in AI-GGC.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in unstructured, real-world environments remains a significant challenge for embodied agents, especially when operating across diverse terrains, weather conditions, and sensor configurations. In this paper, we introduce GeNIE (Generalizable Navigation System for In-the-Wild Environments), a robust navigation framework designed for global deployment. GeNIE integrates a generalizable traversability prediction model built on SAM2 with a novel path fusion strategy that enhances planning stability in noisy and ambiguous settings. We deployed GeNIE in the Earth Rover Challenge (ERC) at ICRA 2025, where it was evaluated across six countries spanning three continents. GeNIE took first place and achieved 79% of the maximum possible score, outperforming the second-best team by 17%, and completed the entire competition without a single human intervention. These results set a new benchmark for robust, generalizable outdoor robot navigation. We will release the codebase, pretrained model weights, and newly curated datasets to support future research in real-world navigation.

Abstract: Lidar SLAM plays a significant role in mobile robot navigation and high-definition map construction. However, existing methods often face a trade-off between localization accuracy and system robustness in scenarios with a high proportion of dynamic objects, point cloud distortion, and unstructured environments. To address this issue, we propose a neural descriptors-based adaptive noise filtering strategy for SLAM, named ADA-DPM, which improves the performance of localization and mapping tasks through three key technical innovations. Firstly, to tackle dynamic object interference, we design the Dynamic Segmentation Head to predict and filter out dynamic feature points, eliminating the ego-motion interference caused by dynamic objects. Secondly, to mitigate the impact of noise and unstructured feature points, we propose the Global Importance Scoring Head that adaptively selects high-contribution feature points while suppressing the influence of noise and unstructured feature points. Moreover, we introduce the Cross-Layer Graph Convolution Module (GLI-GCN) to construct multi-scale neighborhood graphs, fusing local structural information across different scales and improving the discriminative power of overlapping features. Finally, experimental validations on multiple public datasets confirm the effectiveness of ADA-DPM.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has intensified the need for personalized learning methods that can operate efficiently and privately across heterogeneous, resource-constrained devices. However, enabling effective personalized learning in decentralized settings introduces several challenges, including efficient knowledge transfer between clients, protection of data privacy, and resilience against poisoning attacks. In this paper, we address these challenges by developing P4 (Personalized, Private, Peer-to-Peer) -- a method designed to deliver personalized models for resource-constrained IoT devices while ensuring differential privacy and robustness against poisoning attacks. Our solution employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models, maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients. Additionally, we demonstrate its practicality by deploying it on resource-constrained devices, where collaborative training between two clients adds only ~7 seconds of overhead.

<title>From Cradle to Cane: A Two-Pass Framework for High-Fidelity Lifespan Face Aging</title>

Abstract: Face aging has become a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from entertainment to healthcare. However, existing methods struggle with achieving a realistic and seamless transformation across the entire lifespan, especially when handling large age gaps or extreme head poses. The core challenge lies in balancing age accuracy and identity preservation--what we refer to as the Age-ID trade-off. Most prior methods either prioritize age transformation at the expense of identity consistency or vice versa. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a two-pass face aging framework, named Cradle2Cane, based on few-step text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models. The first pass focuses on solving age accuracy by introducing an adaptive noise injection (AdaNI) mechanism. This mechanism is guided by including prompt descriptions of age and gender for the given person as the textual condition. Also, by adjusting the noise level, we can control the strength of aging while allowing more flexibility in transforming the face. However, identity preservation is weakly ensured here to facilitate stronger age transformations. In the second pass, we enhance identity preservation while maintaining age-specific features by conditioning the model on two identity-aware embeddings (IDEmb): SVR-ArcFace and Rotate-CLIP. This pass allows for denoising the transformed image from the first pass, ensuring stronger identity preservation without compromising the aging accuracy. Both passes are jointly trained in an end-to-end way. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ test dataset, evaluated through Face++ and Qwen-VL protocols, show that our Cradle2Cane outperforms existing face aging methods in age accuracy and identity consistency. Code is available at https://github.com/byliutao/Cradle2Cane.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI enables highly realistic synthetic videos, posing significant challenges for content authentication and raising urgent concerns about misuse. Existing detection methods often struggle with generalization and capturing subtle temporal inconsistencies. We propose ReStraV(Representation Straightening Video), a novel approach to distinguish natural from AI-generated videos. Inspired by the "perceptual straightening" hypothesis -- which suggests real-world video trajectories become more straight in neural representation domain -- we analyze deviations from this expected geometric property. Using a pre-trained self-supervised vision transformer (DINOv2), we quantify the temporal curvature and stepwise distance in the model's representation domain. We aggregate statistics of these measures for each video and train a classifier. Our analysis shows that AI-generated videos exhibit significantly different curvature and distance patterns compared to real videos. A lightweight classifier achieves state-of-the-art detection performance (e.g., 97.17% accuracy and 98.63% AUROC on the VidProM benchmark), substantially outperforming existing image- and video-based methods. ReStraV is computationally efficient, it is offering a low-cost and effective detection solution. This work provides new insights into using neural representation geometry for AI-generated video detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) do not preserve privacy at inference-time. The LLM's outputs can inadvertently reveal information about the model's context, which presents a privacy challenge when the LLM is augmented via tools or databases containing sensitive information. Existing privacy-preserving methods at inference-time have significant limitations since they (i) lack provable guarantees or (ii) have a poor utility/privacy trade-off. We propose DP-Fusion, a Differentially Private Inference (DPI) mechanism for LLMs that provably bounds the influence a set of tokens in the context can have on the LLM's output. DP-Fusion works as follows: (1) label a subset of sensitive tokens, (2) infer the LLM without any sensitive tokens to obtain a baseline, (3) infer the LLM with the sensitive tokens, and (4) blend distributions so that the final output remains within a bounded distance of the baseline distribution. While this per-token influence bound also mitigates jailbreak-style prompt injection, we focus on \emph{document privatization}, where the goal is to paraphrase a document containing sensitive tokens, e.g., personally identifiable information, so that no attacker can reliably infer them from the paraphrased document while preserving high text quality. The privacy/utility trade-off is controlled by $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon=0$ hides sensitive tokens entirely, while higher values trade off privacy for improved text quality. We show that our method creates token-level provably privatized documents with substantially improved theoretical and empirical privacy, achieving $6\times$ lower perplexity than related DPI methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are primarily accessed via commercial APIs, but this often requires users to expose their data to service providers. In this paper, we explore how users can stay in control of their data by using privacy profiles: simple natural language instructions that say what should and should not be revealed. We build a framework where a local model uses these instructions to rewrite queries, only hiding details deemed sensitive by the user, before sending them to an external model, thus balancing privacy with performance. To support this research, we introduce PEEP, a multilingual dataset of real user queries annotated to mark private content and paired with synthetic privacy profiles. Experiments with lightweight local LLMs show that, after fine-tuning, they not only achieve markedly better privacy preservation but also match or exceed the performance of much larger zero-shot models. At the same time, the system still faces challenges in fully adhering to user instructions, underscoring the need for models with a better understanding of user-defined privacy preferences.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is crucial for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning methods have made significant progress, but automatic segmentation still faces challenges, including tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. This paper proposes a three-tier fusion architecture that achieves precise brain tumor segmentation. The method processes information progressively at the pixel, feature, and semantic levels. At the pixel level, physical modeling extends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to multimodal data, including simulated ultrasound and synthetic computed tomography (CT). At the feature level, the method performs Transformer-based cross-modal feature fusion through multi-teacher collaborative distillation, integrating three expert teachers (MRI, US, CT). At the semantic level, clinical textual knowledge generated by GPT-4V is transformed into spatial guidance signals using CLIP contrastive learning and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). These three tiers together form a complete processing chain from data augmentation to feature extraction to semantic guidance. We validated the method on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020, 2021, and 2023 datasets. The model achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8665, 0.9014, and 0.8912 on the three datasets, respectively, and reduces the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) by an average of 6.57 millimeters compared with the baseline. This method provides a new paradigm for precise tumor segmentation and boundary localization.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that large language models (LLMs) possess the capability to solve graph reasoning tasks. Notably, even when graph structures are embedded within textual descriptions, LLMs can still effectively answer related questions. This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only Transformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address this, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner mechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input queries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis, we present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures the substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further validate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across layers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of Transformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the concept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite patterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully extract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs. Together, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers perform the substructure extraction task over graph data.

Abstract: Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) often requires running environments across many machines, but most frameworks tie simulation, training, and infrastructure into rigid systems. We introduce ClusterEnv, a lightweight interface for distributed environment execution that preserves the familiar Gymnasium API. ClusterEnv uses the DETACH pattern, which moves environment reset() and step() operations to remote workers while keeping learning centralized. To reduce policy staleness without heavy communication, we propose Adaptive Policy Synchronization (APS), where workers request updates only when divergence from the central learner grows too large. ClusterEnv supports both on- and off-policy methods, integrates into existing training code with minimal changes, and runs efficiently on clusters. Experiments on discrete control tasks show that APS maintains performance while cutting synchronization overhead. Source code is available at https://github.com/rodlaf/ClusterEnv.

Abstract: Discrete Flow-based Models (DFMs) are powerful generative models for high-quality discrete data but typically suffer from slow sampling speeds due to their reliance on iterative decoding processes. This reliance on a multi-step process originates from the factorization approximation of DFMs, which is necessary for handling high-dimensional data. In this paper, we analyze the factorization approximation error using Conditional Total Correlation (TC), and reveal its dependence on the coupling. To address the challenge of efficient few-step generation, we propose Rectified Discrete Flow (ReDi), a novel iterative method that reduces the underlying factorization error (measured as Conditional TC) by rectifying the coupling between source and target distributions. We theoretically prove that each ReDi step guarantees a monotonic decreasing Conditional TC, ensuring its convergence. Empirically, ReDi significantly reduces Conditional TC and enables few-step generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the rectified couplings are well-suited for training efficient one-step models on image generation. ReDi offers a simple and theoretically grounded approach for tackling the few-step challenge, providing a new perspective on efficient discrete data synthesis. Code is available at https://github.com/Ugness/ReDi_discrete.

<title>From Individual Learning to Market Equilibrium: Correcting Structural and Parametric Biases in RL Simulations of Economic Models</title>

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic systems within the broader domain of computational social science.

Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and 0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of 0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Scientific sketches (e.g., models) offer a powerful lens into students' conceptual understanding, yet AI-powered automated assessment of such free-form, visually diverse artifacts remains a critical challenge. Existing solutions often treat sketch evaluation as either an image classification task or monolithic vision-language models, which lack interpretability, pedagogical alignment, and adaptability across cognitive levels. To address these limitations, we present SketchMind, a cognitively grounded, multi-agent framework for evaluating and improving student-drawn scientific sketches. SketchMind comprises modular agents responsible for rubric parsing, sketch perception, cognitive alignment, and iterative feedback with sketch modification, enabling personalized and transparent evaluation. We evaluate SketchMind on a curated dataset of 3,575 student-generated sketches across six science assessment items with different highest order of Bloom's level that require students to draw models to explain phenomena. Compared to baseline GPT-4o performance without SRG (average accuracy: 55.6%), and with SRG integration achieves 77.1% average accuracy (+21.4% average absolute gain). We also demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration with SRG enhances SketchMind performance, for example, GPT-4.1 gains an average 8.9% increase in sketch prediction accuracy, outperforming single-agent pipelines across all items. Human evaluators rated the feedback and co-created sketches generated by \textsc{SketchMind} with GPT-4.1, which achieved an average of 4.1 out of 5, significantly higher than those of baseline models (e.g., 2.3 for GPT-4o). Experts noted the system's potential to meaningfully support conceptual growth through guided revision. Our code and (pending approval) dataset will be released to support reproducibility and future research in AI-driven education.

<title>FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench.

<title>CAPO: Towards Enhancing LLM Reasoning through Generative Credit Assignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02298</link>

arXiv:2508.02298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary feedback. However, current RLVR methods typically assign the same reward to every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment, making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or failure, and often results in suboptimal policies. Methods like PPO provide credit assignment by value estimation, but yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-wise rewards but suffer from several key limitations: they require high-quality process supervision labels, the feedback is unreliable due to probabilistic reward modeling, and their application in online reinforcement learning (RL) is time-consuming. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method-Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Instead of training auxiliary models, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf, general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to generate all step-wise critique by one pass only based on the correctness of the step itself, providing deterministic token-level credits to refine the tokens that were originally assigned identical rule-based rewards. To further enhance the accuracy and robustness, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated critiques. Extensive experiments on various backbones like Llama and Qwen models show that CAPO consistently outperforms supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across four challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks. Further analysis shows that CAPO can help the model to foster the learning of correct reasoning pathways leading to correct answers.

Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSound dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification. However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities. These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion metric.

arXiv:2508.09325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to extract useful representations from high-dimensional inputs while learning effective control from sparse and noisy rewards. Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains difficult. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground the image segmentation process via text inputs. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

arXiv:2508.12081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces VimoRAG, a novel video-based retrieval-augmented motion generation framework for motion large language models (LLMs). As motion LLMs face severe out-of-domain/out-of-vocabulary issues due to limited annotated data, VimoRAG leverages large-scale in-the-wild video databases to enhance 3D motion generation by retrieving relevant 2D human motion signals. While video-based motion RAG is nontrivial, we address two key bottlenecks: (1) developing an effective motion-centered video retrieval model that distinguishes human poses and actions, and (2) mitigating the issue of error propagation caused by suboptimal retrieval results. We design the Gemini Motion Video Retriever mechanism and the Motion-centric Dual-alignment DPO Trainer, enabling effective retrieval and generation processes. Experimental results show that VimoRAG significantly boosts the performance of motion LLMs constrained to text-only input. All the resources are available at https://walkermitty.github.io/VimoRAG/

arXiv:2508.12535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can extract interpretable features from large language models (LLMs) without supervision. However, their effectiveness in downstream steering tasks is limited by the requirement for contrastive datasets or large activation storage. To address these limitations, we propose CorrSteer, which selects features by correlating sample correctness with SAE activations from generated tokens at inference time. This approach uses only inference-time activations to extract more relevant features, thereby reducing spurious correlations. It also obtains steering coefficients from average activations, automating the entire pipeline. Our method shows improved task performance on QA, bias mitigation, jailbreaking prevention, and reasoning benchmarks on Gemma-2 2B and LLaMA-3.1 8B, notably achieving a +3.3% improvement in MMLU performance with 4000 samples and a +27.2% improvement in HarmBench with only 108 samples. Selected features demonstrate semantically meaningful patterns aligned with each task's requirements, revealing the underlying capabilities that drive performance. Our work establishes correlation-based selection as an effective and scalable approach for automated SAE steering across language model applications.

Abstract: In August 2025, a major AI company's immediate, mandatory transition from its previous to its next-generation model triggered widespread public reactions. I collected 150 posts in Japanese and English from multiple social media platforms and video-sharing services between August 8-9, 2025, and qualitatively analyzed expressions of emotional attachment and resistance. Users often described GPT-4o as a trusted partner or AI boyfriend, suggesting person-like bonds. Japanese posts were dominated by loss-oriented narratives, whereas English posts included more anger, meta-level critique, and memes.A preliminary quantitative check showed a statistically significant difference in attachment coding between Japanese and English posts, with substantially higher attachment observed in the Japanese data. The findings suggest that for attachment-heavy models, even safety-oriented changes can face rapid, large-scale resistance that narrows the practical window for behavioral control. If future AI robots capable of inducing emotional bonds become widespread in the physical world, such attachment could surpass the ability to enforce regulation at an even earlier stage than in digital settings. Policy options include gradual transitions, parallel availability, and proactive measurement of attachment thresholds and points of no return to prevent emotional dynamics from outpacing effective governance.

<title>Breaking the Exploration Bottleneck: Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning for General LLM Reasoning</title>

arXiv:2508.16949v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the Best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3. Our code is available at https://github.com/IANNXANG/RuscaRL.

Abstract: This paper investigates the limitations of the normalization in attention mechanisms. We begin with a theoretical framework that enables the identification of the model's selective ability and the geometric separation involved in token selection. Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism. Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.

Abstract: Vulnerability databases, such as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), offer detailed descriptions of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but often lack information on their real-world impact, such as the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that adversaries may use to exploit the vulnerability. However, manually linking CVEs to their corresponding TTPs is a challenging and time-consuming task, and the high volume of new vulnerabilities published annually makes automated support desirable.
  This paper introduces TRIAGE, a two-pronged automated approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to map CVEs to relevant techniques from the ATT&amp;CK knowledge base. We first prompt an LLM with instructions based on MITRE's CVE Mapping Methodology to predict an initial list of techniques. This list is then combined with the results from a second LLM-based module that uses in-context learning to map a CVE to relevant techniques. This hybrid approach strategically combines rule-based reasoning with data-driven inference. Our evaluation reveals that in-context learning outperforms the individual mapping methods, and the hybrid approach improves recall of exploitation techniques. We also find that GPT-4o-mini performs better than Llama3.3-70B on this task. Overall, our results show that LLMs can be used to automatically predict the impact of cybersecurity vulnerabilities and TRIAGE makes the process of mapping CVEs to ATT&amp;CK more efficient. A replication package is available for download from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17341503.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles. Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data, interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions, yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular, non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution. To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art methods, constantly reaching the final goal.

<title>Epistemic Trade-Off: An Analysis of the Operational Breakdown and Ontological Limits of "Certainty-Scope" in AI</title>

Abstract: The recently published "certainty-scope" conjecture offers a compelling insight into the inherent trade-off present within artificial intelligence (AI) systems. As general research, this investigation remains vital as a philosophical undertaking and a potential guide for directing AI investments, design, and deployment, especially in safety-critical and mission-critical domains where risk levels are substantially elevated. While maintaining intellectual coherence, its formalization ultimately consolidates this insight into a suspended epistemic truth, which resists operational implementation within practical systems. This paper argues that the conjecture's objective to furnish insights for engineering design and regulatory decision-making is limited by two fundamental factors: first, its dependence on incomputable constructs and its failure to capture the generality factors of AI, rendering it practically unimplementable and unverifiable; second, its foundational ontological assumption of AI systems as self-contained epistemic entities, distancing it from the complex and dynamic socio-technical environments where knowledge is co-constructed. We conclude that this dual breakdown - an epistemic closure deficit and an embeddedness bypass - hinders the conjecture's transition to a practical and actionable framework suitable for informing and guiding AI deployments. In response, we point towards a possible framing of the epistemic challenge, emphasizing the inherent epistemic burdens of AI within complex human-centric domains.

To address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture. Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by 1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems. The Intersection-Flow-5k dataset is available at https://github.com/AstronZh/Intersection-Flow-5K.

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) are transforming how knowledge is represented, integrated, and applied in scientific research, yet their progress is shaped by the complex nature of scientific data. This survey presents a comprehensive, data-centric synthesis that reframes the development of Sci-LLMs as a co-evolution between models and their underlying data substrate. We formulate a unified taxonomy of scientific data and a hierarchical model of scientific knowledge, emphasizing the multimodal, cross-scale, and domain-specific challenges that differentiate scientific corpora from general natural language processing datasets. We systematically review recent Sci-LLMs, from general-purpose foundations to specialized models across diverse scientific disciplines, alongside an extensive analysis of over 270 pre-/post-training datasets, showing why Sci-LLMs pose distinct demands -- heterogeneous, multi-scale, uncertainty-laden corpora that require representations preserving domain invariance and enabling cross-modal reasoning. On evaluation, we examine over 190 benchmark datasets and trace a shift from static exams toward process- and discovery-oriented assessments with advanced evaluation protocols. These data-centric analyses highlight persistent issues in scientific data development and discuss emerging solutions involving semi-automated annotation pipelines and expert validation. Finally, we outline a paradigm shift toward closed-loop systems where autonomous agents based on Sci-LLMs actively experiment, validate, and contribute to a living, evolving knowledge base. Collectively, this work provides a roadmap for building trustworthy, continually evolving artificial intelligence (AI) systems that function as a true partner in accelerating scientific discovery.

Abstract: We propose a general-purpose approach for improving the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to intelligently and adaptively gather information from a user or other external source using the framework of sequential Bayesian experimental design (BED). This enables LLMs to act as effective multi-turn conversational agents and interactively interface with external environments. Our approach, which we call BED-LLM (Bayesian Experimental Design with Large Language Models), is based on iteratively choosing questions or queries that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) about the task of interest given the responses gathered previously. We show how this EIG can be formulated (and then estimated) in a principled way using a probabilistic model derived from the LLM's predictive distributions and provide detailed insights into key decisions in its construction and updating procedure. We find that BED-LLM achieves substantial gains in performance across a wide range of tests based on the 20 questions game and using the LLM to actively infer user preferences, compared to direct prompting of the LLM and other adaptive design strategies.

Abstract: Mitotic figures represent a key histoprognostic feature in tumor pathology, providing crucial insights into tumor aggressiveness and proliferation. However, their identification remains challenging, subject to significant inter-observer variability, even among experienced pathologists. To address this issue, the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge marks the third edition of an international competition aiming to develop robust mitosis detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a mitotic figure detection approach based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv12 object detection architecture. Our method achieved an F1-score of 0.801 on the preliminary test set (hotspots only) and ranked second on the final test leaderboard with an F1-score of 0.7216 across complex and heterogeneous whole-slide regions, without relying on external data.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length, and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM, and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms. SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior. For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4 percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and scalable large model design.

Abstract: We introduce Creativity Benchmark, an evaluation framework for large language models (LLMs) in marketing creativity. The benchmark covers 100 brands (12 categories) and three prompt types (Insights, Ideas, Wild Ideas). Human pairwise preferences from 678 practising creatives over 11,012 anonymised comparisons, analysed with Bradley-Terry models, show tightly clustered performance with no model dominating across brands or prompt types: the top-bottom spread is $\Delta\theta \approx 0.45$, which implies a head-to-head win probability of $0.61$; the highest-rated model beats the lowest only about $61\%$ of the time. We also analyse model diversity using cosine distances to capture intra- and inter-model variation and sensitivity to prompt reframing. Comparing three LLM-as-judge setups with human rankings reveals weak, inconsistent correlations and judge-specific biases, underscoring that automated judges cannot substitute for human evaluation. Conventional creativity tests also transfer only partially to brand-constrained tasks. Overall, the results highlight the need for expert human evaluation and diversity-aware workflows.

<title>Why and How Auxiliary Tasks Improve JEPA Representations</title>

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero, then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the same transition dynamics or auxiliary value, must map to distinct latent representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately. Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the right equivalence relations.

<title>Communications to Circulations: Real-Time 3D Wind Field Prediction Using 5G GNSS Signals and Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in real-time wind forecasts (up to 30 minutes lead time). The model exhibits robustness across forecast horizons and different pressure levels, and its predictions for wind fields show superior agreement with ground-based radar wind profiler compared to concurrent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.

<title>RPG: A Repository Planning Graph for Unified and Scalable Codebase Generation</title>

Abstract: Large language models excel at generating individual functions or single files of code, yet generating complete repositories from scratch remains a fundamental challenge. This capability is key to building coherent software systems from high-level specifications and realizing the full potential of automated code generation. The process requires planning at two levels: deciding what features and modules to build (proposal stage) and defining their implementation details (implementation stage). Current approaches rely on natural language planning, which often produces unclear specifications, misaligned components, and brittle designs due to its inherent ambiguity and lack of structure. To address these limitations, we introduce the Repository Planning Graph (RPG), a structured representation that encodes capabilities, file structures, data flows, and functions in a unified graph. By replacing free-form natural language with an explicit blueprint, RPG enables consistent long-horizon planning for repository generation. Building on RPG, we develop ZeroRepo, a graph-driven framework that operates in three stages: proposal-level planning, implementation-level construction, and graph-guided code generation with test validation. To evaluate, we construct RepoCraft, a benchmark of six real-world projects with 1,052 tasks. On RepoCraft, ZeroRepo produces nearly 36K Code Lines and 445K Code Tokens, on average 3.9$\times$ larger than the strongest baseline (Claude Code), and 68$\times$ larger than other baselines. It achieves 81.5% coverage and 69.7% test accuracy, improving over Claude Code by 27.3 and 35.8 points. Further analysis shows that RPG models complex dependencies, enables more sophisticated planning through near-linear scaling, and improves agent understanding of repositories, thus accelerating localization.

Abstract: The training scale of large language models (LLMs) has reached tens of thousands of GPUs and is still continuously expanding, enabling faster learning of larger models. Accompanying the expansion of the resource scale is the prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU platform and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month training job on 9,600 GPUs.

arXiv:2509.16959v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning, gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby potentially reducing the final model's performance. To address this, we introduce SON-GOKU, a scheduler that computes gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are activated, and the grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in compatible directions, multi-task learning will improve model performance rather than impede it. Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art multi-task optimizers. We provide extensive theory showing why grouping and sequential updates improve multi-task learning, with guarantees on descent, convergence, and accurately identifying what tasks conflict or align.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting and tracking objects in videos conditioned on natural-language expressions, demanding fine-grained understanding of both appearance and motion. Building on Sa2VA, which couples a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the video segmentation model SAM2, we identify two key bottlenecks that limit segmentation performance: sparse frame sampling and reliance on a single [SEG] token for an entire video. We propose Segmentation Augmented and Selective Averaged Sa2VA (SaSaSa2VA) to address these issues. On the 7th LSVOS Challenge (RVOS track), SaSaSa2VA achieves a $\mathcal{J\&amp;F}$ of 67.45, ranking first and surpassing the runner-up by 2.80 points. This result and ablation studies demonstrate that efficient segmentation augmentation and test-time ensembling substantially enhance grounded MLLMs for RVOS. The code is released in Sa2VA repository: https://github.com/bytedance/Sa2VA.

arXiv:2509.17786v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources. Codebase is available at https://github.com/apanariello4/core-space-merging.

<title>Semantic Representation Attack against Aligned Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.19360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly employ alignment techniques to prevent harmful outputs. Despite these safeguards, attackers can circumvent them by crafting prompts that induce LLMs to generate harmful content.
  Current methods typically target exact affirmative responses, such as ``Sure, here is...'', suffering from limited convergence, unnatural prompts, and high computational costs.
  We introduce Semantic Representation Attack, a novel paradigm that fundamentally reconceptualizes adversarial objectives against aligned LLMs.
  Rather than targeting exact textual patterns, our approach exploits the semantic representation space comprising diverse responses with equivalent harmful meanings.
  This innovation resolves the inherent trade-off between attack efficacy and prompt naturalness that plagues existing methods.
  The Semantic Representation Heuristic Search algorithm is proposed to efficiently generate semantically coherent and concise adversarial prompts by maintaining interpretability during incremental expansion.
  We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees for semantic convergence and demonstrate that our method achieves unprecedented attack success rates (89.41\% averaged across 18 LLMs, including 100\% on 11 models) while maintaining stealthiness and efficiency.
  Comprehensive experimental results confirm the overall superiority of our Semantic Representation Attack.
  The code will be publicly available.

arXiv:2509.23115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby quadratically reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM keeps the pretrained LLM backbone frozen, yielding faster training and lower memory usage. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/he-h/rhythm.

arXiv:2509.23937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has been proposed as a unifying standard for connecting large language models (LLMs) with external tools and resources, promising the same role for AI integration that HTTP and USB played for the Web and peripherals. Yet, despite rapid adoption and hype, its trajectory remains uncertain. Are MCP marketplaces truly growing, or merely inflated by placeholders and abandoned prototypes? Are servers secure and privacy-preserving, or do they expose users to systemic risks? And do clients converge on standardized protocols, or remain fragmented across competing designs? In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of the MCP ecosystem. We design and implement MCPCrawler, a systematic measurement framework that collects and normalizes data from six major markets. Over a 14-day campaign, MCPCrawler aggregated 17,630 raw entries, of which 8,401 valid projects (8,060 servers and 341 clients) were analyzed. Our results reveal that more than half of listed projects are invalid or low-value, that servers face structural risks including dependency monocultures and uneven maintenance, and that clients exhibit a transitional phase in protocol and connection patterns. Together, these findings provide the first evidence-based view of the MCP ecosystem, its risks, and its future trajectory.

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration. While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a single vision-language framework.To tackle ultrasound variability and noise, we curated a 2-million-scale multimodal dataset, combining textbook knowledge, public data, synthetic samples, and general corpora. This ensures robust perception, generalization, and clinical adaptability.The Dolphin series employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining, instruction-driven alignment, and reinforcement-based refinement. Dolphin v1.0 delivers reliable performance in classification, detection, regression, and report generation. Dolphin R1 enhances diagnostic inference, reasoning transparency, and interpretability through reinforcement learning with ultrasound-specific rewards.Evaluated on U2-Bench across eight ultrasound tasks, Dolphin R1 achieves a U2-score of 0.5835-over twice the second-best model (0.2968) setting a new state of the art. Dolphin v1.0 also performs competitively, validating the unified framework. Comparisons show reasoning-enhanced training significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and interpretability, highlighting its importance for high-stakes medical AI.

<title>Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group, SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network, whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark. It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans, lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$ on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at https://github.com/showmeon/TimeEmb.

Abstract: A Comparison of Independent and Joint Fine-tuning Strategies for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Download PDF Neal Gregory Lawton, Alfy Samuel, Anoop Kumar, Daben Liu Published: 20 Aug 2025, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models (LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the embedding and generator models is required.

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

<title>Market-Driven Subset Selection for Budgeted Training</title>

Abstract: Training large language models on massive datasets is computationally expensive, yet empirical evidence suggests that substantial portions of training examples contribute minimally to final performance. Data subset selection addresses this inefficiency by identifying small, high-utility subsets under resource constraints. However, example utility is inherently multi-faceted, encompassing uncertainty, distributional rarity, and diversity signals that are heterogeneous and typically combined through ad hoc weighted sums lacking theoretical grounding. We propose a market-based framework that treats each training example as a tradeable contract and employs the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule to aggregate multiple utility signals into coherent prices. Heterogeneous signals act as traders, a single liquidity parameter controls concentration versus smoothing, and topic-wise normalization ensures calibrated aggregation. Token budgets are handled explicitly through a price-per-token decision rule with an interpretable length-bias parameter. We establish theoretical connections to maximum-entropy aggregation and provide utility recovery guarantees under noisy but monotone signals. On GSM8K mathematical reasoning under strict 60k-token budgets, our selector achieves parity with strong single-signal baselines while exhibiting lower variance and incurring less than 0.1 GPU-hour overhead. On AGNews classification at 5-25\% retention rates, the market formulation delivers competitive accuracy with improved stability. Our framework unifies multi-signal data curation under fixed computational budgets for prompt-level reasoning and classification tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the problem of kinematic synthesis for planar linkages as a cross-domain image generation task. We develop a planar linkages dataset using RGB image representations, covering a range of mechanisms: from simple types such as crank-rocker and crank-slider to more complex eight-bar linkages like Jansen's mechanism. A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explore the potential of image generative models for synthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding the drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same architecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory shape and velocity profiles. We validate our method on three datasets of increasing complexity: a standard four-bar linkage set, a mixed set of four-bar and crank-slider mechanisms, and a complex set including multi-loop mechanisms. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based representations for generative mechanical design, showing that mechanisms with revolute and prismatic joints, and potentially cams and gears, can be represented and synthesized within a unified image generation framework.

Abstract: Multi-agent deployments of large language models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in market, allocation, and governance workflows, yet covert coordination among agents can silently erode trust and social welfare. Existing audits are dominated by heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees, struggle to transfer across tasks, and seldom ship with the infrastructure needed for independent replication. We introduce Audit the Whisper, a conference-grade research artifact that spans theory, benchmark design, detection, and reproducibility. Our contributions are: (i) a channel-capacity analysis showing how interventions such as paraphrase, rate limiting, and role permutation impose quantifiable capacity penalties-operationalised via paired-run Kullback--Leibler diagnostics-that tighten mutual-information thresholds with finite-sample guarantees and full proofs; (ii) ColludeBench-v0, covering pricing, first-price auctions, peer review, and hosted Gemini/Groq APIs with configurable covert schemes, deterministic manifests, and reward instrumentation; and (iii) a calibrated auditing pipeline that fuses cross-run mutual information, permutation invariance, watermark variance, and fairness-aware acceptance bias, each tuned to a $10^{-3}$ false-positive budget and validated by 10k honest runs plus an e-value martingale. Across ColludeBench and external suites including Secret Collusion, CASE, Perfect Collusion Benchmark, and SentinelAgent, the union meta-test attains state-of-the-art power at fixed FPR while ablations surface price-of-auditing trade-offs and fairness-driven colluders invisible to MI alone. We release regeneration scripts, anonymized manifests, and documentation so that external auditors can reproduce every figure, satisfy double-blind requirements, and extend the framework with minimal effort.

Abstract: Digital technologies are transforming democratic life in conflicting ways. This article bridges two perspectives to unpack these tensions. First, we present an original survey of software developers in Silicon Valley, interrogating how coder worldviews, ethics, and workplace cultures shape the democratic potential and social impact of the technologies they build. Results indicate that while most developers recognize the power of their products to influence civil liberties and political discourse, they often face ethical dilemmas and top-down pressures that can lead to design choices undermining democratic ideals. Second, we critically investigate these findings in the context of an emerging new digital divide, not of internet access but of information quality. We interrogate the survey findings in the context of the Slop Economy, in which billions of users unable to pay for high-quality content experience an internet dominated by low-quality, AI-generated ad-driven content. We find a reinforcing cycle between tech creator beliefs and the digital ecosystems they spawn. We discuss implications for democratic governance, arguing for more ethically informed design and policy interventions to help bridge the digital divide to ensure that technological innovation supports rather than subverts democratic values in the next chapter of the digital age.

<title>SDAR: A Synergistic Diffusion-AutoRegression Paradigm for Scalable Sequence Generation</title>

arXiv:2510.06303v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose SDAR, a Synergistic Diffusion-Autoregression paradigm that unifies the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel inference capability of diffusion. Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR performs a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained autoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief, data-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences autoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens within each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive experiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient than masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation. Building on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion with minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel generation. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures confirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger robustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups without accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning and domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on challenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and gains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting and pass@k. Together, these results establish SDAR as a practical paradigm that combines the strengths of autoregression and diffusion for scalable, high-throughput reasoning.

Abstract: Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with strong correlations, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at https://github.com/wwhenxuan/SymTime.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies, present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

<title>DICE: Structured Reasoning in LLMs through SLM-Guided Chain-of-Thought Correction</title>

arXiv:2510.09211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When performing reasoning tasks with user-specific requirements, such as strict output formats, large language models (LLMs) often prioritize reasoning over adherence to detailed instructions. Fine-tuning LLMs on supervised datasets to address this is impractical due to high computational costs and limited parameter access. To tackle this, we propose DICE, a lightweight framework that guides small language models (SLMs) to refine LLMs' outputs through chain-of-thought (CoT) correction. DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\% and 29.4\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.

Our approach prioritises trustworthiness of the certification: we formally verify our implementation of the encoding to timed automata using the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL and we use an existing certificate checker (also formally verified in Isabelle/HOL) to certify the model checking result.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1) decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and (3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is \emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and (iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding.

Abstract: The autonomy and contextual complexity of LLM-based agents render traditional access control (AC) mechanisms insufficient. Static, rule-based systems designed for predictable environments are fundamentally ill-equipped to manage the dynamic information flows inherent in agentic interactions. This position paper argues for a paradigm shift from binary access control to a more sophisticated model of information governance, positing that the core challenge is not merely about permission, but about governing the flow of information. We introduce Agent Access Control (AAC), a novel framework that reframes AC as a dynamic, context-aware process of information flow governance. AAC operates on two core modules: (1) multi-dimensional contextual evaluation, which assesses not just identity but also relationships, scenarios, and norms; and (2) adaptive response formulation, which moves beyond simple allow/deny decisions to shape information through redaction, summarization, and paraphrasing. This vision, powered by a dedicated AC reasoning engine, aims to bridge the gap between human-like nuanced judgment and scalable Al safety, proposing a new conceptual lens for future research in trustworthy agent design.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?" yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work, we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs' trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

Abstract: Object detection traditionally relies on costly manual annotation. We present the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised YOLO and zero-shot vision-language models (Gemini Flash 2.5 and GPT-4). Evaluated on 5,000 stratified COCO images and 500 diverse product images, combined with Total Cost of Ownership modeling, we derive break-even thresholds for architecture selection. Results show supervised YOLO attains 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for Gemini and 71.3% for GPT-4 on standard categories; the annotation expense for a 100-category system is $10,800, and the accuracy advantage only pays off beyond 55 million inferences (151,000 images/day for one year). On diverse product categories Gemini achieves 52.3% and GPT-4 55.1%, while supervised YOLO cannot detect untrained classes. Cost-per-correct-detection favors Gemini ($0.00050) and GPT-4 ($0.00067) over YOLO ($0.143) at 100,000 inferences. We provide decision frameworks showing that optimal architecture choice depends on inference volume, category stability, budget, and accuracy requirements.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Probabilistic Models, inductive biases, anisotropic noise operator, spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion, selective omission

Summary:
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have shown strong generative performance, but their inductive biases are not explicitly defined. This study introduces an anisotropic noise operator, called spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD), to incorporate inductive biases into DPM training and sampling. By replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance, SAGD allows for the emphasis or suppression of specific frequency bands while maintaining a Gaussian forward process. The derived score relation for anisotropic covariances shows that the learned score converges to the true data score with anisotropy reshaping the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirical results demonstrate that the induced anisotropy in SAGD surpasses standard diffusion methods on various vision datasets and enables selective omission of known corruptions within specific bands. This showcases the efficacy of utilizing anisotropic forward noise to customize inductive bias in DPMs.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

It identifies a need for new evaluations that address overlooked aspects of narrative understanding and are better aligned with existing metrics. Only 27% of narrative tasks are well covered by current benchmarks, with areas like narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation being underrepresented. There is a pressing need for benchmarks that can assess subjective and perspectival elements of narratives where there is no single correct answer.

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area. We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas -- including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

<div> benchmark, language models, numerical estimation, reasoning under uncertainty, probabilistic priors

Summary:<br />
This study introduces the OpenEstimate benchmark, designed to evaluate language models (LMs) on numerical estimation tasks requiring synthesizing background information and expressing predictions as probabilistic priors. The benchmark aims to address the gap in LM evaluations related to reasoning under uncertainty. Results from testing six frontier LMs show that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident. Modest improvements in performance were observed based on how uncertainty is elicited from the model, with no significant impact from sampling strategy, reasoning effort, or prompt design. Overall, the OpenEstimate benchmark provides a challenging evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that excel in probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident. Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in a Unity-based 3D environment. The system consists of two agents: a hummingbird agent and a floating island agent. The hummingbird agent, trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, learns to navigate the terrain, locate and collect flowers efficiently. The floating island agent is also trained using PPO to generate flower layouts based on various factors. The interaction between these agents results in emergent behavior and robust generalization across different environmental configurations. The approach not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also paves the way for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. The research demonstrates the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to generate and solve content in virtual environments, showcasing the groundbreaking contributions of AI in creative game development processes. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic, replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects (flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

<div> Keywords: AGI, theory limited, error centric shift, Causal Mechanics, interventions

Summary: 
The article argues that progress towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is limited by theory rather than data or scale. It challenges the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, suggesting that observational adequacy alone is insufficient for interventional competence. By analyzing the limits of observational learning, the article proposes an error-centric approach through Causal Mechanics, emphasizing hypothesis space change as a key operation. Structural principles such as the Locality and Autonomy Principle, Independent Causal Mechanisms, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle are introduced to facilitate error discovery and correction. The goal is to develop systems capable of transforming unreachable errors into reachable ones and rectifying them efficiently. <div>

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations, definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed. We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct them.

<div> Keywords: human reasoning, AI, cognitive science, machine reasoning, benchmark 

Summary:
Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has long been a goal in AI and cognitive science. While large language models can approximate human responses on a large scale, they often overlook individual reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To address this gap, the HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark) has been introduced as a benchmark for average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task involves predicting how a specific person would reason and update their beliefs in new scenarios based on partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent includes both synthetic and human tracks for evaluating intra-agent fidelity. Experiments with advanced language models show ongoing adaptation challenges, highlighting the need for aligning machine reasoning with the diversity of human thought. The benchmark and associated chatbot, TraceYourThinking, have been made publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines, we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable, reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/trace-your-thinking).

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale, longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy, sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles, employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32 extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available, enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling, emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

<div> Keywords: AGI evaluation, domain weighting, snapshot testing, homeostatic property cluster, cluster stability

Summary: 
The traditional approach to evaluating AGI lacks nuance in assigning weights to different domains and relies on snapshot testing that may not accurately capture the true capabilities of an artificial general intelligence system. The author proposes a new framework that views general intelligence as a homeostatic property cluster, comprising a set of abilities and mechanisms that maintain stability under perturbation. This new approach suggests weighting domains based on their causal centrality and requiring evidence of persistence across multiple sessions to distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances. Two battery-compatible extensions are proposed: a centrality-prior score and a Cluster Stability Index family that assesses profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These additions aim to preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming in AGI evaluations. The author concludes with testable predictions and protocols for labs to adopt without requiring access to the underlying architecture. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without architectural access.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel multi-dimensional data analysis approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to create a dynamic analytical ecosystem. LLM agents are used to extract product data from unstructured data, which is then visualized in real-time through the construction of KGs. This method allows for deep exploration and analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform, enabling users to uncover insights in product ecosystems and mine relationships. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis. By leveraging the strengths of LLMs and KGs, this method offers a new perspective on multi-dimensional data analysis and provides valuable tools for researchers and practitioners in the field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive, heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination" issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

Summary:
KG-Agent is introduced as a framework to enhance the efficiency of large language model-based agents operating in API-free software environments. By structuring interactions into a State-Action Knowledge Graph (SA-KG), KG-Agent allows agents to generalize from past strategies and make more informed decisions. A hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on graph topology encourages targeted exploration while valuing setup actions with delayed rewards. KG-Agent outperforms existing methods in exploration efficiency and strategic depth in complex GUI-based decision-making environments such as Civilization V and Slay the Spire.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences, they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex, open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
AUGUSTUS is a new multimodal agent system that incorporates external memory databases and is inspired by human memory systems. The system includes four stages: encode, store in memory, retrieve, and act, connected in a loop for efficient task performance. Unlike existing systems, AUGUSTUS conceptualizes information into semantic tags and stores them in a graph-structured multimodal contextual memory for concept-driven retrieval. The system outperforms traditional multimodal approaches like RAG, is 3.5 times faster for ImageNet classification, and surpasses MemGPT on the MSC benchmark. This approach highlights the importance of considering multimodal signals in agent systems and demonstrates the effectiveness of using a semantic tag-based memory system for efficient information retrieval in cognitive tasks.

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals. Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i) encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and (iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases, we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC benchmark.

Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

Summary:
The article introduces VERITAS, a pipeline that enhances the quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data for large multimodal models (LMMs). It integrates vision priors extracted from visual recognition models and OCR systems with multiple state-of-the-art LMMs to improve SFT data quality. Three LMMs evaluate original answers, providing critique rationales that are statistically fused into a consensus score. A lightweight critic model is trained using this consensus score for efficient reasoning enhancement. LMMs then refine original answers based on critiques, generating new candidate answers for selection of the highest-scoring final answer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that models fine-tuned with VERITAS-processed data outperform those using raw data, especially in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. The critic model demonstrates enhanced capability comparable to leading LMMs while being more efficient. The pipeline, datasets, and model checkpoints are released to support further research in multimodal data optimization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers, providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus, we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Summary:
DEPO is a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to address inefficiencies in large reasoning models. It introduces three key components to reduce unnecessary reasoning and improve model performance. The innovative advantage decoupled algorithm guides the reduction of inefficient tokens, while a difficulty-aware length penalty reduces overall sequence length. Additionally, an advantage clipping method prevents bias in policy optimization. In experiments with DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B base models, DEPO demonstrated a significant 39% reduction in sequence length and eliminated excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, ultimately outperforming the base model in accuracy. This framework presents a promising solution to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of large reasoning models in various applications.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption, especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models. Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Summary: 
The article discusses the limited adoption of machine learning techniques in analog integrated circuit layout due to electric and problem-specific constraints. The researchers develop an automatic floorplanning engine using reinforcement learning and graph convolutional neural network to create more routable layouts. By integrating high grid resolution and precise pin information, along with dynamic routing resource estimation, a balance between routing efficiency and area efficiency is achieved. In simulated environments, the proposed approach shows a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6% reduction in wirelength, and a 73.4% increase in routing success compared to previous state-of-the-art techniques. The focus on routing-aware floorplanning solutions addresses concerns of layout engineers and aims to meet industrial standards. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints, along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards. When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment, the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6% reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

<div> corrigibility, AI training, goals, safety, transformation 

Summary:
In the realm of AI training, ensuring that the AI does not resist the training process is crucial for achieving desired goals. The concept of corrigibility, defined as goals that do not incentivize actions to avoid updates or shutdown, is essential for safe and efficient AI development. This study introduces a formal definition of corrigibility and presents a transformation method to make any goal corrigible without compromising performance. By eliciting predictions of reward based on preventing updates, this method ensures that the AI continues to pursue goals effectively while remaining open to corrections and changes in human preferences. The transformation can also be extended to new agents created by corrigible agents and prevents deliberate goal modifications. Experimental results in gridworld scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of learning corrigible goals and their ability to lead to desired behaviors. <div>

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However, partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them. We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training, corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible, without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces MARS, an RL framework focused on enhancing multi-agent reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) through self-play in cooperative and competitive games. MARS addresses challenges like long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation with a turn-level advantage estimator and agent-specific advantage normalization. The MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B demonstrates strong strategic abilities that generalize well, with up to 28.7% performance improvement in held-out games. The self-play training results in consistent performance gains beyond games, improving multi-agent systems' reasoning benchmarks by 10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond when integrated into existing systems. The study establishes end-to-end RL training with self-play as a valuable approach for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7% performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of 10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.

<div> Adaptive Minds, LoRA adapters, agentic system, multi-agent orchestration, LangGraph <br />
Summary: <br />
Adaptive Minds is a novel agentic system that leverages LoRA adapters as domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single finely-tuned model or rigid rule-based routing, the system empowers the base LLM to act as a semantic router, dynamically selecting the most relevant LoRA tool for each query. This flexibility enables the agent to seamlessly switch between different domain experts as needed. By combining multi-agent orchestration with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive Minds delivers accurate and specialized responses while maintaining conversational abilities. The system utilizes LangGraph for workflow management, supports both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance. <div>

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

<div> Keywords: reinforcement learning, judgment inconsistencies, logical coherence, Conflict Detection Rate, Deconflicted Graph Rewards

Summary: 
The article introduces a comprehensive framework to address judgment inconsistencies in reinforcement learning, focusing on logical coherence and the issue of preference cycles. The framework includes two main contributions: the Conflict Detection Rate (CDR) metric to quantify conflicts and the Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR) framework to remove cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and generates a coherent reward signal compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework significantly improves training stability and model performance compared to strong baselines, highlighting the importance of logical consistency in AI feedback. This framework provides a systematic approach to detect and resolve inconsistencies during reinforcement learning training, emphasizing the management of logical coherence as a crucial dimension to enhance AI performance.

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap, we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

arXiv:2510.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships, are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-SQL, large language models, SQL generation, JudgeSQL, structured reasoning

Summary:
JudgeSQL addresses the challenges of text-to-SQL conversion by introducing a structured reasoning-based framework that improves SQL candidate selection. Traditional approaches like self-consistency or best-of-N decoding lack depth in scoring, leading to inconsistent results and fragile reasoning chains. JudgeSQL uses a reasoning-based SQL judge model guided by reinforcement learning to accurately assess candidate queries. It then employs a weighted consensus tournament that combines explicit reasoning preferences with implicit generator confidence for more reliable and efficient selections. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark show that JudgeSQL outperforms existing methods in SQL judgment capabilities, cross-scale generalization, and robustness to generator capacity. This innovative approach has the potential to greatly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of text-to-SQL conversion tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool. Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$ decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards, enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Summary:  
- A machine learning framework was developed to improve health monitoring by integrating context from prior visits, especially in cases with limited and variable frequency of prior visits.  
- The model first estimates disease risk using data from the most recent visit and then refines the assessment using information from previous imaging and clinical biomarkers.  
- Applying this framework to prostate cancer risk prediction showed a significant reduction in false positive rates by integrating information from prior visits.  
- The inclusion of prior context not only increased specificity but also preserved high sensitivity in predicting the risk of clinically significant prostate cancer.  
- By incorporating information collected over time, false positive rates significantly decreased for predictions of both current risk and risk within five years, offering potential benefits for early detection and improved health outcomes.  

<br /><br />Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2510.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931 blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

It discusses the limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in generating complete and consistent protocols. To address this, the authors introduce the SciRecipe dataset, consisting of structured protocols in various biological subfields. They propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which emphasizes explicit and verifiable steps in protocol generation. A structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity. Thoth, a model developed using a Knowledge-to-Action process, outperforms existing LLMs in terms of step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy. The approach enables the development of reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge and experimental execution.<br /><br />Summary: The article discusses the importance of reproducible science and presents the SciRecipe dataset, proposing a new paradigm and model, Thoth, for generating precise and reliable scientific protocols. <div>
arXiv:2510.15600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise, logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs) often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context management that hinders long-horizon research. We present \texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring \textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a \coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization -- users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including \textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication} to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research -- from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

Summary: 
This study explores Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) by addressing the limitations of assuming uniform annotator preferences and relying on binary comparisons. The researchers connect preference learning in RLHF with the econometrics literature and highlight the need for rankings over three or more responses for identifying latent user preferences accurately. They introduce methods to incorporate heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms, including an Expectation-Maximization adaptation of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train a mixture of large language models (LLMs) based on latent annotator types. Additionally, they propose an aggregation algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to ensure equitable performance guarantees for diverse users in generative model alignment. This framework establishes a theoretical and algorithmic foundation for fairness and personalization in aligning generative models with human values. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.15716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations: the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Summary: <br />
This study introduces a novel multimodal learning approach for Parkinson's disease assessment, addressing limitations such as the need for synchronization of modalities during training and dependence on all modalities during inference. The proposed system, TRIP, formulates multimodal learning as a multi-objective optimization problem, allowing for more flexible modality requirements. A margin-based class rebalancing strategy is also introduced to enhance category learning and mitigate imbalance within modalities. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate TRIP's state-of-the-art performance, outperforming baselines in both synchronous and asynchronous settings. This highlights the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed framework. <div>

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years, particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques. Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources. However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting, highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

Summary: 
This study explores the impact of explainability on user trust in AI systems, specifically focusing on different types of explanations and their influence on perceived trust. Through a quantitative experimental design using a web-based loan approval simulation, the researchers found that interactive explanations, such as interactive counterfactuals, enhance user engagement and confidence. The clarity and relevance of explanations were identified as key factors in determining trust. These findings contribute to the field of human-centered explainable AI by providing empirical evidence on the measurable effects of explainability design on user perception. <div>

Abstract: Large-scale AI models such as GPT-4 have accelerated the deployment of artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive, web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on user perception

<div> Keywords: wicked problems, artificial intelligence, Large Language Model, dialogue, expertise 

Summary: 
The article discusses how modern complex problems, known as 'wicked problems', can be addressed using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs have capabilities that can be enhanced through various methods, they lack inherent mechanisms to develop expertise in solving complex problems. The authors propose a framework called Dialectica, where agents engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory, self-reflection, and context editing. This framework views discussion as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. Results from two different model architectures show that enabling reflection-based context editing during dialogue leads to agents that outperform their baseline counterparts. The findings suggest that dialogue-driven context evolution can effectively enhance expertise in open non-verifiable domains. <div>

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example, fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools, LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory, self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The `dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Summary: 
The study examines the effectiveness of various Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus configurations in answering clinical questions related to Long COVID (LC). Six different configurations were evaluated using an LLM-as-a-judge framework with the LongCOVID-CQ dataset. The combination of clinical guidelines and high-quality systematic reviews consistently outperformed other approaches, providing a balanced approach to supporting clinical decision-making for emerging diseases like LC. The findings suggest that a hybrid approach that integrates expert knowledge with comprehensive literature databases, known as Guide-RAG, is optimal for answering LC clinical questions. This approach avoids information overload and oversimplified guidance, offering a more nuanced and accurate response to complex medical queries. <div>

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in https://github.com/XingruiWang/Spatial457.

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.

Summary: 
This article introduces stochastic reward machines as a solution for dealing with noisy rewards in reinforcement learning problems. The algorithm presented in the article utilizes constraint solving to learn minimal stochastic reward machines based on the exploration of a reinforcement learning agent. By pairing this algorithm with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines, it guarantees convergence to an optimal policy over time. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in two case studies, where it outperformed both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions. This development is significant as it addresses the practical limitation of existing algorithms, which assume noise-free rewards, and provides a more realistic solution for real-world reinforcement learning scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm, based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

Summary:
In this study, a parallel implementation of the Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) using the NVIDIA CUDA framework was presented. Metaheuristic algorithms are effective in solving complex problems but suffer from increasing execution times with larger problem sizes. By implementing a parallel version of the APO, significant performance improvements were achieved, with up to 6.7 times speedup demonstrated on benchmark functions of CEC2022. The sequential and parallel versions of the APO were compared, showing the advantages of parallel computing in optimizing metaheuristic algorithms. Real-world applications in engineering optimization and image thresholding using the otsu method were used to test the performance of the proposed implementation, highlighting the efficiency of parallel computing for handling practical tasks. <div>

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of these algorithms increases with the problem size and solution space. And, to get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are now-adays working on design and development of parallel versions of state of the art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a parallel implementation of state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer using NVIDIA CUDA framework to leverage GPU acceleration. Our implementation optimizes the state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) to achieve high performance. We implement both the existing sequential version and the proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer in this paper. The experimental results calculated over benchmarks functions of CEC2022 demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up achieved in case of proposed parallel version. We also use two real world applications (1) Tension/Compression Spring Design in engineering optimization and (2) Image Thresholding using otsu method for testing the performance of proposed implementation in handling real tasks.

Abstract: We propose DeepAries , a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for dynamic portfolio management that jointly optimizes the timing and allocation of rebalancing decisions. Unlike prior reinforcement learning methods that employ fixed rebalancing intervals regardless of market conditions, DeepAries adaptively selects optimal rebalancing intervals along with portfolio weights to reduce unnecessary transaction costs and maximize risk-adjusted returns. Our framework integrates a Transformer-based state encoder, which effectively captures complex long-term market dependencies, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to generate simultaneous discrete (rebalancing intervals) and continuous (asset allocations) actions. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world financial markets demonstrate that DeepAries significantly outperforms traditional fixed-frequency and full-rebalancing strategies in terms of risk-adjusted returns, transaction costs, and drawdowns. Additionally, we provide a live demo of DeepAries at https://deep-aries.github.io/, along with the source code and dataset at https://github.com/dmis-lab/DeepAries, illustrating DeepAries' capability to produce interpretable rebalancing and allocation decisions aligned with shifting market regimes. Overall, DeepAries introduces an innovative paradigm for adaptive and practical portfolio management by integrating both timing and allocation into a unified decision-making process.

Summary:
RegimeFolio is a novel framework designed to adapt to non-stationary financial markets by integrating explicit volatility regime segmentation, sector-specific ensemble forecasting, and adaptive mean-variance allocation. The framework includes a VIX-based classifier for market regime detection, regime and sector-specific ensemble learners, and a dynamic mean-variance optimizer with shrinkage-regularized covariance estimates. Evaluation on 34 large cap U.S. equities from 2020 to 2024 showed that RegimeFolio achieved a cumulative return of 137 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.17, a 12 percent lower maximum drawdown, and a 15 to 20 percent improvement in forecast accuracy compared to conventional and advanced machine learning benchmarks. The results demonstrate that explicitly modeling volatility regimes in predictive learning and portfolio allocation enhances robustness and leads to more dependable decision-making in real markets.

Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary, with shifting volatility regimes that alter asset co-movements and return distributions. Standard portfolio optimization methods, typically built on stationarity or regime-agnostic assumptions, struggle to adapt to such changes. To address these challenges, we propose RegimeFolio, a novel regime-aware and sector-specialized framework that, unlike existing regime-agnostic models such as DeepVol and DRL optimizers, integrates explicit volatility regime segmentation with sector-specific ensemble forecasting and adaptive mean-variance allocation. This modular architecture ensures forecasts and portfolio decisions remain aligned with current market conditions, enhancing robustness and interpretability in dynamic markets. RegimeFolio combines three components: (i) an interpretable VIX-based classifier for market regime detection; (ii) regime and sector-specific ensemble learners (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to capture conditional return structures; and (iii) a dynamic mean-variance optimizer with shrinkage-regularized covariance estimates for regime-aware allocation. We evaluate RegimeFolio on 34 large cap U.S. equities from 2020 to 2024. The framework achieves a cumulative return of 137 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.17, a 12 percent lower maximum drawdown, and a 15 to 20 percent improvement in forecast accuracy compared to conventional and advanced machine learning benchmarks. These results show that explicitly modeling volatility regimes in predictive learning and portfolio allocation enhances robustness and leads to more dependable decision-making in real markets.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a powerful means of capturing the manifold of realistic protein structures, enabling rapid design for protein engineering tasks. However, existing approaches observe critical failure modes when precise constraints are necessary for functional design. To this end, we present a constrained diffusion framework for structure-guided protein design, ensuring strict adherence to functional requirements while maintaining precise stereochemical and geometric feasibility. The approach integrates proximal feasibility updates with ADMM decomposition into the generative process, scaling effectively to the complex constraint sets of this domain. We evaluate on challenging protein design tasks, including motif scaffolding and vacancy-constrained pocket design, while introducing a novel curated benchmark dataset for motif scaffolding in the PDZ domain. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art, providing perfect satisfaction of bonding and geometric constraints with no degradation in structural diversity.

Abstract: With the growth of digital financial systems, robust security and privacy have become a concern for financial institutions. Even though traditional machine learning models have shown to be effective in fraud detections, they often compromise user data by requiring centralized access to sensitive information. In IoT-enabled financial endpoints such as ATMs and POS Systems that regularly produce sensitive data that is sent over the network. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving, decentralized model training across institutions without sharing raw data. FL enables cross-silo collaboration among banks while also using cross-device learning on IoT endpoints. This survey explores the role of FL in enhancing financial security and introduces a novel classification of its applications based on regulatory and compliance exposure levels ranging from low-exposure tasks such as collaborative portfolio optimization to high-exposure tasks like real-time fraud detection. Unlike prior surveys, this work reviews FL's practical use within financial systems, discussing its regulatory compliance and recent successes in fraud prevention and blockchain-integrated frameworks. However, FL deployment in finance is not without challenges. Data heterogeneity, adversarial attacks, and regulatory compliance make implementation far from easy. This survey reviews current defense mechanisms and discusses future directions, including blockchain integration, differential privacy, secure multi-party computation, and quantum-secure frameworks. Ultimately, this work aims to be a resource for researchers exploring FL's potential to advance secure, privacy-compliant financial systems.

Summary:
The article discusses the GAZE pipeline, a system designed to automate the conversion of raw video into labeled datasets for training robust world models. The pipeline normalizes video formats, applies AI models for pre-annotation, and consolidates signals for human validation. Efficiency gains and reduced human review volume are achieved through auto-skipping low-salience segments. The method increases label density and consistency while incorporating privacy safeguards. The systematic approach generates high-quality, privacy-aware datasets suitable for cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction training. The article provides details on orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to serve as a scalable blueprint for creating world model training data efficiently and securely. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription, PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii) consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata, our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without sacrificing throughput or governance.

Summary:<br />
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) plays a crucial role in medicine, but high signal-to-noise ratio doses limit its clinical use. Lowering doses to reduce radiation exposure leads to increased Poisson noise, which current denoising methods struggle to address, resulting in distortions and artifacts. To tackle this issue, a Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a novel Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) has been introduced. This loss incorporates physical data to enhance image fidelity by maintaining statistical unbiasedness in variance and gradient adaptation, making it resilient to minor data mismatches. Through tests conducted on PET datasets, it has been demonstrated that the PC-UNet model significantly improves physical consistency and image fidelity, showcasing its efficacy in effectively integrating physical information. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Machine learning models, specifically Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, were utilized to predict CKD and CVD. Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy, with ensemble models performing better in identifying high-risk patients. The hybrid statistical machine learning framework integrated key parameters for improved early detection and risk stratification of diabetic complications compared to conventional diagnostic methods. Despite challenges like interpretability and class imbalance, this approach shows promise in advancing early diagnosis and management of CKD and CVD in diabetic individuals.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease are major complications of diabetes, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Early detection of these conditions is critical, yet traditional diagnostic markers often lack sensitivity in the initial stages. This study integrates conventional statistical methods with machine learning approaches to improve early diagnosis of CKD and CVD in diabetic patients. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed in SPSS to explore associations between diseases and clinical or demographic factors. Patients were categorized into four groups: Group A both CKD and CVD, Group B CKD only, Group C CVD only, and Group D no disease. Statistical analysis revealed significant correlations: Serum Creatinine and Hypertension with CKD, and Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Myocardial Infarction, Stroke, and Hypertension with CVD. These results guided the selection of predictive features for machine learning models. Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest algorithms were implemented, with Random Forest showing the highest accuracy, particularly for CKD prediction. Ensemble models outperformed single classifiers in identifying high-risk diabetic patients. SPSS results further validated the significance of the key parameters integrated into the models. While challenges such as interpretability and class imbalance remain, this hybrid statistical machine learning framework offers a promising advancement toward early detection and risk stratification of diabetic complications compared to conventional diagnostic approaches.

<div> Keywords: Code translation, Large Language Models, Parallel corpora, Data augmentation, Two-stage training 

Summary: 
Code translation is the process of converting code from one language to another and is increasingly important in software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code translation, with parallel corpora playing a key role in model training. These corpora can be program-aligned (PA) or snippet-aligned (SA) data, each providing different benefits. Researchers have explored data augmentation methods to improve code translation, with previous focus on PA data. This paper introduces a data augmentation method using LLMs to generate SA data automatically. Additionally, a two-stage training strategy that combines PA and SA data is proposed, leading to consistent performance enhancements compared to using only PA data. Experimental results on TransCoder-test demonstrate the effectiveness of the augmented SA data and the two-stage training approach, achieving a maximum improvement of 3.78% on pass@k.

Abstract: Code translation aims to translate the code from its source language to the target language and is used in various software development scenarios. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their capabilities in code translation, and parallel corpora play a crucial role in training models for code translation. Parallel corpora can be categorized into program-alignment (PA) and snippet-alignment (SA) data. Although PA data has complete context and is suitable for semantic alignment learning, it may not provide adequate fine-grained training signals due to its extended length, while the brevity of SA data enables more fine-grained alignment learning. Due to limited parallel corpora, researchers explore several augmentation methods for code translation. Previous studies mainly focus on augmenting PA data. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method that leverages LLMs to generate SA data automatically. To fully leverage both PA data and SA data, we explore a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy, which consistently enhances model performance compared to fine-tuning solely on PA data. Experiments on TransCoder-test demonstrate that our augmented SA data combined with the two-stage training approach yields consistent improvements over the baseline, achieving a maximum gain of 3.78% on pass@k.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces TangledFeatures, a framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. Traditional methods focus on predictive accuracy but can struggle with correlated predictors. TangledFeatures identifies representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing redundancy while maintaining explanatory power. The selected feature subset improves interpretability and stability in downstream models. The framework was applied to predicting backbone torsional angles of Alanine Dipeptide, demonstrating that the selected features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances. TangledFeatures offers a more interpretable and stable basis for analysis compared to traditional feature selection techniques. <div>

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that explain variation in these angles.

- Current toxicity detectors are limited by single-label benchmarks, resulting in biased evaluations and hindering effective evaluation and development. The new benchmarks and methodology address these limitations, providing a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of toxicity in language model-generated content.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a range of natural language processing tasks, but their potential to generate harmful content has raised serious safety concerns. Current toxicity detectors primarily rely on single-label benchmarks, which cannot adequately capture the inherently ambiguous and multi-dimensional nature of real-world toxic prompts. This limitation results in biased evaluations, including missed toxic detections and false positives, undermining the reliability of existing detectors. Additionally, gathering comprehensive multi-label annotations across fine-grained toxicity categories is prohibitively costly, further hindering effective evaluation and development. To tackle these issues, we introduce three novel multi-label benchmarks for toxicity detection: \textbf{Q-A-MLL}, \textbf{R-A-MLL}, and \textbf{H-X-MLL}, derived from public toxicity datasets and annotated according to a detailed 15-category taxonomy. We further provide a theoretical proof that, on our released datasets, training with pseudo-labels yields better performance than directly learning from single-label supervision. In addition, we develop a pseudo-label-based toxicity detection method. Extensive experimental results show that our approach significantly surpasses advanced baselines, including GPT-4o and DeepSeek, thus enabling more accurate and reliable evaluation of multi-label toxicity in LLM-generated content.

Summary: 
The study evaluated Generative AI models' scoring performances for student essays with and without idioms. Three models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) assessed essays using the same rubric as human raters. Gemini showed the highest interrater reliability and consistency among the models, with no bias detected for any demographic group. For essays with idioms, Gemini closely followed human rater patterns. The study suggests a hybrid approach, with Gemini identified as the best candidate due to its ability to handle figurative language.

Abstract: The developments in Generative AI technologies have paved the way for numerous innovations in different fields. Recently, Generative AI has been proposed as a competitor to AES systems in evaluating student essays automatically. Considering the potential limitations of AI in processing idioms, this study assessed the scoring performances of Generative AI models for essays with and without idioms by incorporating insights from Corpus Linguistics and Computational Linguistics. Two equal essay lists were created from 348 student essays taken from a corpus: one with multiple idioms present in each essay and another with no idioms in essays. Three Generative AI models (ChatGPT, Gemini, and Deepseek) were asked to score all essays in both lists three times, using the same rubric used by human raters in assigning essay scores. The results revealed excellent consistency for all models, but Gemini outperformed its competitors in interrater reliability with human raters. There was also no detectable bias for any demographic group in AI assessment. For essays with multiple idioms, Gemini followed a the most similar pattern to human raters. While the models in the study demonstrated potential for a hybrid approach, Gemini was the best candidate for the task due to its ability to handle figurative language and showed promise for handling essay-scoring tasks alone in the future.

Summary:
An ensemble-based deep learning framework was developed for unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines to improve reliability in the renewable energy sector. The method combines Variational Autoencoders, LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer architectures to extract temporal and contextual patterns from high-dimensional SCADA data. A feature engineering pipeline processes temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators to train the deep models. Ensemble scoring and adaptive thresholding are used for anomaly detection without labeled fault data. The approach was evaluated on real-world turbine data from three wind farms and achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.947, with early fault detection up to 48 hours before failure. This method enables predictive maintenance, reduces turbine failures, and enhances operational efficiency in large-scale wind energy deployments.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector, where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions, followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in large-scale wind energy deployments.

Summary: 
This study explores the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) through the tropical geometry of neural networks. By leveraging this perspective, the researchers introduce a novel, geometry-informed initialization method for sigmoidal multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). They demonstrate that Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks can be represented as tropical rationals, opening up new possibilities for model initialization. Specifically focusing on planar binary classification, the researchers design purely sigmoidal MLPs that align with the finite-sum structure of UAT. These models feature decision boundaries that conform to predetermined shapes from the outset and can be further optimized through standard training processes. This innovative approach provides a practical link between the tropical viewpoint and smooth MLPs, offering interpretable, shape-oriented initialization alternatives without necessitating the use of ReLU architectures. The study showcases the construction and empirical validation of these models in two dimensions, leaving room for future exploration of theoretical aspects and extensions to higher-dimensional scenarios. <div>

Abstract: We revisit the Universal Approximation Theorem(UAT) through the lens of the tropical geometry of neural networks and introduce a constructive, geometry-aware initialization for sigmoidal multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Tropical geometry shows that Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) networks admit decision functions with a combinatorial structure often described as a tropical rational, namely a difference of tropical polynomials. Focusing on planar binary classification, we design purely sigmoidal MLPs that adhere to the finite-sum format of UAT: a finite linear combination of shifted and scaled sigmoids of affine functions. The resulting models yield decision boundaries that already align with prescribed shapes at initialization and can be refined by standard training if desired. This provides a practical bridge between the tropical perspective and smooth MLPs, enabling interpretable, shape-driven initialization without resorting to ReLU architectures. We focus on the construction and empirical demonstrations in two dimensions; theoretical analysis and higher-dimensional extensions are left for future work.

Summary:  
- Text-to-Image models have advanced quickly but still suffer from semantic leakage, where features are transferred between entities unintentionally.  
- DeLeaker is introduced as an optimization-free approach at inference time to mitigate leakage by manipulating attention maps.  
- The DeLeaker process dynamically adjusts attention maps to reduce cross-entity interactions and strengthen individual identities.  
- SLIM dataset is introduced for systematic evaluation with human-verified samples and an automatic evaluation framework.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages), the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130 human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

Summary: <br />
This article introduces a proactive guardrail system to defend against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting large language models. The system utilizes a honeypot-based approach, where a bait model generates ambiguous responses to lure attackers and probe their intent. By inserting proactive bait questions in multi-turn interactions, malicious intent can be gradually exposed. The Honeypot Utility Score (HUS) evaluates the attractiveness and feasibility of bait responses, while the Defense Efficacy Rate (DER) balances safety and usability. Initial experiments show that the system disrupts jailbreak attempts while maintaining a positive user experience. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to multi-turn jailbreak attacks, where adversaries iteratively elicit harmful behaviors that bypass single-turn safety filters. Existing defenses predominantly rely on passive rejection, which either fails against adaptive attackers or overly restricts benign users. We propose a honeypot-based proactive guardrail system that transforms risk avoidance into risk utilization. Our framework fine-tunes a bait model to generate ambiguous, non-actionable but semantically relevant responses, which serve as lures to probe user intent. Combined with the protected LLM's safe reply, the system inserts proactive bait questions that gradually expose malicious intent through multi-turn interactions. We further introduce the Honeypot Utility Score (HUS), measuring both the attractiveness and feasibility of bait responses, and use a Defense Efficacy Rate (DER) for balancing safety and usability. Initial experiment on MHJ Datasets with recent attack method across GPT-4o show that our system significantly disrupts jailbreak success while preserving benign user experience.

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

Abstract: Language models demonstrate remarkable abilities when pre-trained on large text corpora and fine-tuned for specific tasks, but how and why pre-training shapes the success of the final model remains poorly understood. Notably, although pre-training success is often quantified by cross entropy loss, cross-entropy can be a poor predictor of downstream performance. Instead, we provide a theoretical perspective on this relationship through the lens of \emph{coverage}, which quantifies the probability mass the pre-trained model places on high-quality responses and which is necessary and sufficient for post-training and test-time scaling methods such as Best-of-N to succeed. Our main results develop an understanding of \emph{the coverage principle}, a phenomenon whereby next-token prediction implicitly optimizes toward a model with good coverage. In particular, we uncover a mechanism that explains the power of coverage in predicting downstream performance: \emph{coverage generalizes faster than cross entropy}, avoiding spurious dependence on problem-dependent parameters such as the sequence length. We also study practical algorithmic interventions with provable benefits for improving coverage, including (i) model/checkpoint selection procedures, (ii) gradient normalization schemes, and (iii) test-time decoding strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks exploiting cross-modal vulnerabilities. In this work, we introduce a novel method that leverages sequential comic-style visual narratives to circumvent safety alignments in state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our method decomposes malicious queries into visually innocuous storytelling elements using an auxiliary LLM, generates corresponding image sequences through diffusion models, and exploits the models' reliance on narrative coherence to elicit harmful outputs. Extensive experiments on harmful textual queries from established safety benchmarks show that our approach achieves an average attack success rate of 83.5\%, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by 46\%. Compared with existing visual jailbreak methods, our sequential narrative strategy demonstrates superior effectiveness across diverse categories of harmful content. We further analyze attack patterns, uncover key vulnerability factors in multimodal safety mechanisms, and evaluate the limitations of current defense strategies against narrative-driven attacks, revealing significant gaps in existing protections.

Abstract: Effective and efficient access to relevant information is essential for disaster management. However, no retrieval model is specialized for disaster management, and existing general-domain models fail to handle the varied search intents inherent to disaster management scenarios, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable performance. To this end, we introduce DMRetriever, the first series of dense retrieval models (33M to 7.6B) tailored for this domain. It is trained through a novel three-stage framework of bidirectional attention adaptation, unsupervised contrastive pre-training, and difficulty-aware progressive instruction fine-tuning, using high-quality data generated through an advanced data refinement pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DMRetriever achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all six search intents at every model scale. Moreover, DMRetriever is highly parameter-efficient, with 596M model outperforming baselines over 13.3 X larger and 33M model exceeding baselines with only 7.6% of their parameters.

Abstract: Hand abstraction is crucial for scaling imperfect-information games (IIGs) such as Texas Hold'em, yet progress is limited by the lack of a formal task model and by evaluations that require resource-intensive strategy solving. We introduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored to hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action sequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction. Within this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic upper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using the bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms suffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we formalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and prove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this limitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates historical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality. Experiments on hold'em-style benchmarks confirm that FROI consistently outperforms outcome-based imperfect-recall baselines. Our results provide a unified formal treatment of hand abstraction and practical guidance for designing higher-resolution abstractions in IIGs.

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long, physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative, enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to attention-based or convolutional regressors.

Abstract: Modern language models are powerful, but typically static after deployment. A major obstacle to building models that continually learn over time is catastrophic forgetting, where updating on new data erases previously acquired capabilities. Motivated by the intuition that mitigating forgetting is challenging because trainable parameters are shared across all tasks, we investigate whether sparse parameter updates can enable learning without catastrophic forgetting. We introduce sparse memory finetuning, leveraging memory layer models (Berges et al., 2024), which are sparsely updated by design. By updating only the memory slots that are highly activated by a new piece of knowledge relative to usage on pretraining data, we reduce interference between new knowledge and the model's existing capabilities. We evaluate learning and forgetting compared to full finetuning and parameter-efficient finetuning with LoRA on two question answering tasks. We find that sparse memory finetuning learns new knowledge while exhibiting substantially less forgetting: while NaturalQuestions F1 drops by 89% after full finetuning on new facts and 71% with LoRA, sparse memory finetuning yields only an 11% drop with the same level of new knowledge acquisition. Our results suggest sparsity in memory layers offers a promising path toward continual learning in large language models.

Abstract: In emerging networked systems, mobile edge devices such as ground vehicles and unmanned aerial system (UAS) swarms collectively aggregate vast amounts of data to make machine learning decisions such as threat detection in remote, dynamic, and infrastructure-constrained environments where power and bandwidth are scarce. Federated learning (FL) addresses these constraints and privacy concerns by enabling nodes to share local model weights for deep neural networks instead of raw data, facilitating more reliable decision-making than individual learning. However, conventional FL relies on a central server to coordinate model updates in each learning round, which imposes significant computational burdens on the central node and may not be feasible due to the connectivity constraints. By eliminating dependence on a central server, distributed federated learning (DFL) offers scalability, resilience to node failures, learning robustness, and more effective defense strategies. Despite these advantages, DFL remains vulnerable to increasingly advanced and stealthy cyberattacks. In this paper, we design sophisticated targeted training data poisoning and backdoor (Trojan) attacks, and characterize the emerging vulnerabilities in a vehicular network. We analyze how DFL provides resilience against such attacks compared to individual learning and present effective defense mechanisms to further strengthen DFL against the emerging cyber threats.

<title>DLER: Doing Length pEnalty Right - Incentivizing More Intelligence per Token via Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over 70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Social media platforms play a pivotal role in shaping political discourse, but analyzing their vast and rapidly evolving content remains a major challenge. We introduce an end-to-end framework for automatically generating an interpretable topic taxonomy from an unlabeled corpus. By combining unsupervised clustering with prompt-based labeling, our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to iteratively construct a taxonomy without requiring seed sets or domain expertise. We apply this framework to a large corpus of Meta (previously known as Facebook) political ads from the month ahead of the 2024 U.S. Presidential election. Our approach uncovers latent discourse structures, synthesizes semantically rich topic labels, and annotates topics with moral framing dimensions. We show quantitative and qualitative analyses to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our findings reveal that voting and immigration ads dominate overall spending and impressions, while abortion and election-integrity achieve disproportionate reach. Funding patterns are equally polarized: economic appeals are driven mainly by conservative PACs, abortion messaging splits between pro- and anti-rights coalitions, and crime-and-justice campaigns are fragmented across local committees. The framing of these appeals also diverges--abortion ads emphasize liberty/oppression rhetoric, while economic messaging blends care/harm, fairness/cheating, and liberty/oppression narratives. Topic salience further reveals strong correlations between moral foundations and issues. Demographic targeting also emerges. This work supports scalable, interpretable analysis of political messaging on social media, enabling researchers, policymakers, and the public to better understand emerging narratives, polarization dynamics, and the moral underpinnings of digital political communication.

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) are commonly used in educational testing, as they offer an efficient means of evaluating learners' knowledge. However, generating high-quality MCQs, particularly in low-resource languages such as Persian, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces FarsiMCQGen, an innovative approach for generating Persian-language MCQs. Our methodology combines candidate generation, filtering, and ranking techniques to build a model that generates answer choices resembling those in real MCQs. We leverage advanced methods, including Transformers and knowledge graphs, integrated with rule-based approaches to craft credible distractors that challenge test-takers. Our work is based on data from Wikipedia, which includes general knowledge questions. Furthermore, this study introduces a novel Persian MCQ dataset comprising 10,289 questions. This dataset is evaluated by different state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and the quality of the generated dataset, which has the potential to inspire further research on MCQs.

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than 60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

<title>Structure-R1: Dynamically Leveraging Structural Knowledge in LLM Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable advances in reasoning capabilities. However, their performance remains constrained by limited access to explicit and structured domain knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external information as context to augment reasoning. Nevertheless, traditional RAG systems typically operate over unstructured and fragmented text, resulting in low information density and suboptimal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textsc{Structure-R1}, a novel framework that transforms retrieved content into structured representations optimized for reasoning. Leveraging reinforcement learning, \textsc{Structure-R1} learns a content representation policy that dynamically generates and adapts structural formats based on the demands of multi-step reasoning. Unlike prior methods that rely on fixed schemas, our approach adopts a generative paradigm capable of producing task-specific structures tailored to individual queries. To ensure the quality and reliability of these representations, we introduce a self-reward structural verification mechanism that checks whether the generated structures are both correct and self-contained. Extensive experiments on seven knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that \textsc{Structure-R1} consistently achieves competitive performance with a 7B-scale backbone model and matches the performance of much larger models. Additionally, our theoretical analysis demonstrates how structured representations enhance reasoning by improving information density and contextual clarity. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/jlwu002/sr1.

<title>The Economics of AI Foundation Models: Openness, Competition, and Governance</title>

Abstract: The strategic choice of model "openness" has become a defining issue for the foundation model (FM) ecosystem. While this choice is intensely debated, its underlying economic drivers remain underexplored. We construct a two-period game-theoretic model to analyze how openness shapes competition in an AI value chain, featuring an incumbent developer, a downstream deployer, and an entrant developer. Openness exerts a dual effect: it amplifies knowledge spillovers to the entrant, but it also enhances the incumbent's advantage through a "data flywheel effect," whereby greater user engagement today further lowers the deployer's future fine-tuning cost. Our analysis reveals that the incumbent's optimal first-period openness is surprisingly non-monotonic in the strength of the data flywheel effect. When the data flywheel effect is either weak or very strong, the incumbent prefers a higher level of openness; however, for an intermediate range, it strategically restricts openness to impair the entrant's learning. This dynamic gives rise to an "openness trap," a critical policy paradox where transparency mandates can backfire by removing firms' strategic flexibility, reducing investment, and lowering welfare. We extend the model to show that other common interventions can be similarly ineffective. Vertical integration, for instance, only benefits the ecosystem when the data flywheel effect is strong enough to overcome the loss of a potentially more efficient competitor. Likewise, government subsidies intended to spur adoption can be captured entirely by the incumbent through strategic price and openness adjustments, leaving the rest of the value chain worse off. By modeling the developer's strategic response to competitive and regulatory pressures, we provide a robust framework for analyzing competition and designing effective policy in the complex and rapidly evolving FM ecosystem.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design, traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training. The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity, demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

<title>ReasonIF: Large Reasoning Models Fail to Follow Instructions During Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence: the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions. Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning (RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to 0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) are often constrained by short audio context windows, even when their text backbones support long contexts, limiting long-form audio understanding. Prior work has introduced context-extension methods (e.g. YaRN) on unimodal LLMs, yet their application to LALMs remains unexplored. First, building on RoPE-based context extension, we introduce Partial YaRN, a training-free, audio-only extension method that modifies only audio token positions, leaving text positions intact to preserve the base LLM's text capabilities. Second, we propose Virtual Longform Audio Training (VLAT), a training strategy that extends Partial YaRN into a training-time positional augmentation. VLAT simulates diverse audio lengths during training, enabling generalization to inputs far longer than those seen in training and improving robustness for long-context audio understanding. Our experiments on SALMONN and Qwen2-Audio show that Partial YaRN outperforms the original models across wide range of settings, and VLAT training strategy provides substantial improvement, achieving strong performance on long audio of unseen lengths.

<title>Adaptive Individual Uncertainty under Out-Of-Distribution Shift with Expert-Routed Conformal Prediction</title>

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity (PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous, chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD) splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity (lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage (SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

Abstract: Current autoregressive language models (ARMs) achieve high accuracy but require long token sequences, making them costly. Discrete diffusion language models (DDLMs) enable parallel and flexible generation within a fixed number of steps and have recently emerged for their strong performance in complex reasoning and long-term planning tasks. We present a study exploring hybrid architectures that couple DDLMs with ARMs to assess whether their collaboration can yield complementary benefits. We first examine collaboration in text space, where one model plans the reasoning process and another executes the final answer based on that plan. We then extend this setup to latent-space communication, introducing a learned projector that maps DDLM latents into the ARM's embedding space, potentially bypassing some of the text-generation limitations of diffusion models. We find that shifting DDLM --> ARM communication from text space to latent space yields significant accuracy gains, for example increasing from 27.0% to 54.0% on DART-5 and from 0.0% to 14.0% on AIME24. We also find that combining a DDLM planner with an ARM executor can provide substantial computational savings with little to no impact on accuracy. For example, the latent-space pipeline, using 64 tokens for planning and roughly 5 for execution, surpasses Qwen3.1-7B on DART-5 and AIME, despite Qwen using 44 times more tokens. Overall, our study offers new insights into reasoning with DDLMs and highlights their potential in hybrid architectures.

<title>DRO-InstructZero: Distributionally Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However, popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently, prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this, DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points. Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift. Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment under real-world uncertainty.

<title>Robust Layerwise Scaling Rules by Proper Weight Decay Tuning</title>

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent, degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically, the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as $\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as $\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields \emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance. Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

Abstract: Automated International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding assigns standardized diagnosis and procedure codes to clinical records, playing a critical role in healthcare systems. However, existing methods face challenges such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding. TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS, Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations, bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.

Abstract: Medical texts, particularly electronic medical records (EMRs), are a cornerstone of modern healthcare, capturing critical information about patient care, diagnoses, and treatments. These texts hold immense potential for advancing clinical decision-making and healthcare analytics. However, their unstructured nature, domain-specific language, and variability across contexts make automated understanding an intricate challenge. Despite the advancements in natural language processing, existing methods often treat all data as equally challenging, ignoring the inherent differences in complexity across clinical records. This oversight limits the ability of models to effectively generalize and perform well on rare or complex cases. In this paper, we present TACL (Threshold-Adaptive Curriculum Learning), a novel framework designed to address these challenges by rethinking how models interact with medical texts during training. Inspired by the principle of progressive learning, TACL dynamically adjusts the training process based on the complexity of individual samples. By categorizing data into difficulty levels and prioritizing simpler cases early in training, the model builds a strong foundation before tackling more complex records. By applying TACL to multilingual medical data, including English and Chinese clinical records, we observe significant improvements across diverse clinical tasks, including automatic ICD coding, readmission prediction and TCM syndrome differentiation. TACL not only enhances the performance of automated systems but also demonstrates the potential to unify approaches across disparate medical domains, paving the way for more accurate, scalable, and globally applicable medical text understanding solutions.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1) Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3) Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention. Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However, most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions, enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging. Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions, yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research.

<title>Exemplar-Guided Planing: Enhanced LLM Agent for KGQA</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as interactive agents show significant promise in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) but often struggle with the semantic gap between natural language queries and structured knowledge graph (KG) representations. This leads to suboptimal planning and inefficient exploration on KG, while training-free approaches often underutilize valuable reasoning patterns in training data. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework, Exemplar-Guided Planning (EGP), which enhances the planning capabilities of LLM agents for KGQA. EGP first preprocesses the training set questions via entity templating to normalize semantic variations. It then retrieves highly similar exemplary questions and their successful reasoning paths from this preprocessed set using semantic embeddings and an efficient FAISS index. These retrieved exemplars dynamically guide the LLM's planning process in two key phases: (1) Task Decomposition, by aligning generated sub-objectives with proven reasoning steps, and (2) Relation Exploration, by providing high-quality auxiliary information to improve relation pruning accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a Smart Lookahead mechanism during relation exploration to improve efficiency by preemptively exploring promising paths and potentially terminating exploration earlier. We apply EGP to the Plan-on-Graph (PoG) framework, termed PoG-EGP. Extensive experiments on two real-world KGQA datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, demonstrate that PoG-EGP significantly improves over the baseline PoG system and other compared methods.

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems critically depend on high-quality ranking models. However, traditional pipelines still rely on manual feature engineering and scenario-specific architectures, which hinder cross-scenario transfer and large-scale deployment. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{MTmixAtt}, a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with Multi-Mix Attention, designed for large-scale recommendation tasks. MTmixAtt integrates two key components. The \textbf{AutoToken} module automatically clusters heterogeneous features into semantically coherent tokens, removing the need for human-defined feature groups. The \textbf{MTmixAttBlock} module enables efficient token interaction via a learnable mixing matrix, shared dense experts, and scenario-aware sparse experts, capturing both global patterns and scenario-specific behaviors within a single framework. Extensive experiments on the industrial TRec dataset from Meituan demonstrate that MTmixAtt consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Transformer-based models, WuKong, HiFormer, MLP-Mixer, and RankMixer. At comparable parameter scales, MTmixAtt achieves superior CTR and CTCVR metrics; scaling to MTmixAtt-1B yields further monotonic gains. Large-scale online A/B tests validate the real-world impact: in the \textit{Homepage} scenario, MTmixAtt increases Payment PV by \textbf{+3.62\%} and Actual Payment GTV by \textbf{+2.54\%}. Overall, MTmixAtt provides a unified and scalable solution for modeling arbitrary heterogeneous features across scenarios, significantly improving both user experience and commercial outcomes.

Abstract: In this paper we present a neural network-based method for the automatic detection of phase transitions and classification of hidden percolation patterns in a (1+1)-dimensional replication process. The proposed network model is based on the combination of CNN, TCN and GRU networks, which are trained directly on raw configurations without any manual feature extraction. The network reproduces the phase diagram and assigns phase labels to configurations. It shows that deep architectures are capable of extracting hierarchical structures from the raw data of numerical experiments.

Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

<title>DSSmoothing: Toward Certified Dataset Ownership Verification for Pre-trained Language Models via Dual-Space Smoothing</title>

Abstract: Large web-scale datasets have driven the rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs), but unauthorized data usage has raised serious copyright concerns. Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications are blindfolded to the infrastructure underneath and generate tokens autoregressively, indifferent to the system load, thus risking inferencing latency inflation and poor user experience. Our first-cut controller, named beLLMan, enables the LLM infrastructure to actively and progressively signal the first-party LLM application to adjust the output length in response to changing system load. On a real testbed with H100 GPUs, beLLMan helps keep inferencing latency under control (upto 8X lower end-to-end latency) and reduces energy consumption by 25% (while serving 19% more requests) during periods of congestion for a summarization workload.

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods. Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain, which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation, with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

Abstract: Automatic readability assessment plays a key role in ensuring effective and accessible written communication. Despite significant progress, the field is hindered by inconsistent definitions of readability and measurements that rely on surface-level text properties. In this work, we investigate the factors shaping human perceptions of readability through the analysis of 897 judgments, finding that, beyond surface-level cues, information content and topic strongly shape text comprehensibility. Furthermore, we evaluate 15 popular readability metrics across five English datasets, contrasting them with six more nuanced, model-based metrics. Our results show that four model-based metrics consistently place among the top four in rank correlations with human judgments, while the best performing traditional metric achieves an average rank of 8.6. These findings highlight a mismatch between current readability metrics and human perceptions, pointing to model-based approaches as a more promising direction.

Abstract: Ensembling Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained attention as a promising approach to surpass the performance of individual models by leveraging their complementary strengths. In particular, aggregating models' next-token probability distributions to select the next token has been shown to be effective in various tasks. However, while successful for short-form answers, its application to long-form generation remains underexplored. In this paper, we show that using existing ensemble methods in long-form generation requires a careful choice of ensembling positions, since the standard practice of ensembling at every token often degrades performance. We identify two key factors for determining these positions: tokenization mismatch across models and consensus in their next-token probability distributions. Based on this, we propose SAFE, (Stable And Fast LLM Ensembling), a framework that selectively ensembles by jointly considering these factors. To further improve stability, we introduce a probability sharpening strategy that consolidates probabilities spread across multiple sub-word tokens representing the same word into a single representative token. Our experiments on diverse benchmarks, including MATH500 and BBH, demonstrate that SAFE outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, with gains achieved even when ensembling fewer than 1% of tokens.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for photorealistic robot simulation that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting as a drop-in renderer within vectorized physics simulators such as IsaacGym. This enables unprecedented speed -- exceeding 100,000 steps per second on consumer GPUs -- while maintaining high visual fidelity, which we showcase across diverse tasks. We additionally demonstrate its applicability in a sim-to-real robotics setting. Beyond depth-based sensing, our results highlight how rich visual semantics improve navigation and decision-making, such as avoiding undesirable regions. We further showcase the ease of incorporating thousands of environments from iPhone scans, large-scale scene datasets (e.g., GrandTour, ARKit), and outputs from generative video models like Veo, enabling rapid creation of realistic training worlds. This work bridges high-throughput simulation and high-fidelity perception, advancing scalable and generalizable robot learning. All code and data will be open-sourced for the community to build upon.

Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is a foundational tool in machine learning, with recent work emphasizing its connections to neural networks. However, existing theory primarily addresses the i.i.d. setting, while real-world data often exhibits structured dependencies - particularly in applications like denoising score learning where multiple noisy observations derive from shared underlying signals. We present the first systematic study of KRR generalization for non-i.i.d. data with signal-noise causal structure, where observations represent different noisy views of common signals. By developing a novel blockwise decomposition method that enables precise concentration analysis for dependent data, we derive excess risk bounds for KRR that explicitly depend on: (1) the kernel spectrum, (2) causal structure parameters, and (3) sampling mechanisms (including relative sample sizes for signals and noises). We further apply our results to denoising score learning, establishing generalization guarantees and providing principled guidance for sampling noisy data points. This work advances KRR theory while providing practical tools for analyzing dependent data in modern machine learning applications.

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of both EEG and ECoG signals.

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones, are increasingly used in search and rescue missions to detect human presence. Existing systems primarily leverage vision-based methods which are prone to fail under low-visibility or occlusion. Drone-based audio perception offers promise but suffers from extreme ego-noise that masks sounds indicating human presence. Existing datasets are either limited in diversity or synthetic, lacking real acoustic interactions, and there are no standardized setups for drone audition. To this end, we present DroneAudioset (The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ahlab-drone-project/DroneAudioSet/ under the MIT license), a comprehensive drone audition dataset featuring 23.5 hours of annotated recordings, covering a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from -57.2 dB to -2.5 dB, across various drone types, throttles, microphone configurations as well as environments. The dataset enables development and systematic evaluation of noise suppression and classification methods for human-presence detection under challenging conditions, while also informing practical design considerations for drone audition systems, such as microphone placement trade-offs, and development of drone noise-aware audio processing. This dataset is an important step towards enabling design and deployment of drone-audition systems.

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS} (\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance \underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components. The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM}) enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on, compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+ clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1) Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions (liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points (good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points (good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems are essential for providing fact-based guidance from Malaysian Clinical Practice Guidelines. However, their effectiveness with image-based queries is limited, as general Vision-Language Model captions often lack clinical specificity and factual grounding. This study proposes and validates a framework to specialize the MedGemma model for generating high-fidelity captions that serve as superior queries. To overcome data scarcity, we employ a knowledge distillation pipeline to create a synthetic dataset across dermatology, fundus, and chest radiography domains, and fine-tune MedGemma using the parameter-efficient QLoRA method. Performance was rigorously assessed through a dual framework measuring both classification accuracy and, via a novel application of the RAGAS framework, caption faithfulness, relevancy, and correctness. The fine-tuned model demonstrated substantial improvements in classification performance, while RAGAS evaluation confirmed significant gains in caption faithfulness and correctness, validating the models ability to produce reliable, factually grounded descriptions. This work establishes a robust pipeline for specializing medical VLMs and validates the resulting model as a high-quality query generator, laying the groundwork for enhancing multimodal RAG systems in evidence-based clinical decision support.

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency.

<title>Select Less, Reason More: Prioritizing Evidence Purity for Video Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework, which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and, crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our 7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

<title>Expediting Reinforcement Learning by Incorporating Knowledge About Temporal Causality in the Environment</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism, thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its strengths empirically.

Abstract: In this paper, we show that interventionally robust optimization problems in causal models are continuous under the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance, but may be discontinuous under the standard Wasserstein distance. This highlights the importance of using generative models that respect the causal structure when augmenting data for such tasks. To this end, we propose a new normalizing flow architecture that satisfies a universal approximation property for causal structural models and can be efficiently trained to minimize the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model outperforms standard (non-causal) generative models in data augmentation for causal regression and mean-variance portfolio optimization in causal factor models.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT). We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits, with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model (specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning from correct demonstrations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly become integral to real-world applications, powering services across diverse sectors. However, their widespread deployment has exposed critical security risks, particularly through jailbreak prompts that can bypass model alignment and induce harmful outputs. Despite intense research into both attack and defense techniques, the field remains fragmented: definitions, threat models, and evaluation criteria vary widely, impeding systematic progress and fair comparison. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we address these challenges by (1) proposing a holistic, multi-level taxonomy that organizes attacks, defenses, and vulnerabilities in LLM prompt security; (2) formalizing threat models and cost assumptions into machine-readable profiles for reproducible evaluation; (3) introducing an open-source evaluation toolkit for standardized, auditable comparison of attacks and defenses; (4) releasing JAILBREAKDB, the largest annotated dataset of jailbreak and benign prompts to date; and (5) presenting a comprehensive evaluation and leaderboard of state-of-the-art methods. Our work unifies fragmented research, provides rigorous foundations for future studies, and supports the development of robust, trustworthy LLMs suitable for high-stakes deployment.

<title>Selecting and Combining Large Language Models for Scalable Code Clone Detection</title>

Abstract: Source code clones pose risks ranging from intellectual property violations to unintended vulnerabilities. Effective and efficient scalable clone detection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the rapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and potential LLM-ensemble efficacy.
  This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering them down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The candidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and a commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though CodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates suggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and tailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a top-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\% precision: twice the precision of previously used CodeBERT.
  To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the selected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results suggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods like maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling approach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the best-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\% over individual LLM on the commercial large-scale code.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate code, but can they generate fast code? In this paper, we study this question using a dataset of 65 real-world tasks mined from open-source Java programs. We specifically select tasks where developers achieved significant speedups, and employ an automated pipeline to generate patches for these issues using two leading LLMs under four prompt variations. By rigorously benchmarking the results against the baseline and human-authored solutions, we demonstrate that LLM-generated code indeed improves performance over the baseline in most cases. However, patches proposed by human developers outperform LLM fixes by a statistically significant margin, indicating that LLMs often fall short of finding truly optimal solutions. We further find that LLM solutions are semantically identical or similar to the developer optimization idea in approximately two-thirds of cases, whereas they propose a more original idea in the remaining one-third. However, these original ideas only occasionally yield substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator (i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training. Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a policy offline without further interaction with the real environment. Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and robustness.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) across diverse cognitive tasks, the rapid enhancement of these capabilities also introduces emergent deceptive behaviors that may induce severe risks in high-stakes deployments. More critically, the characterization of deception across realistic real-world scenarios remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we establish DeceptionBench, the first benchmark that systematically evaluates how deceptive tendencies manifest across different societal domains, what their intrinsic behavioral patterns are, and how extrinsic factors affect them. Specifically, on the static count, the benchmark encompasses 150 meticulously designed scenarios in five domains, i.e., Economy, Healthcare, Education, Social Interaction, and Entertainment, with over 1,000 samples, providing sufficient empirical foundations for deception analysis. On the intrinsic dimension, we explore whether models exhibit self-interested egoistic tendencies or sycophantic behaviors that prioritize user appeasement. On the extrinsic dimension, we investigate how contextual factors modulate deceptive outputs under neutral conditions, reward-based incentivization, and coercive pressures. Moreover, we incorporate sustained multi-turn interaction loops to construct a more realistic simulation of real-world feedback dynamics. Extensive experiments across LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) reveal critical vulnerabilities, particularly amplified deception under reinforcement dynamics, demonstrating that current models lack robust resistance to manipulative contextual cues and the urgent need for advanced safeguards against various deception behaviors. Code and resources are publicly available at https://github.com/Aries-iai/DeceptionBench.

<title>The Road Less Traveled: Enhancing Exploration in LLMs via Sequential Sampling</title>

arXiv:2510.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution, potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Abstract: AI has the potential to significantly improve how NGOs utilize their limited resources for societal benefits, but evidence about how NGOs adopt AI remains scattered. In this study, we systematically investigate the types of AI adoption use cases in NGOs and identify common challenges and solutions, contextualized by organizational size and geographic context. We review the existing primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in NGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the PRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with regular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final literature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we identify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity, Decision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common challenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel understanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges to organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while AI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger organizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can help NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving effectiveness, engagement, and social impact.

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works. Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension: dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning distillation.

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval, which seeks to retrieve relevant content across modalities such as text or image, supports applications from AI search to contents production. Despite the success of separate-encoder approaches like CLIP align modality-specific embeddings with contrastive learning, recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable a unified encoder that directly processes composed inputs. While flexible and advanced, we identify that unified encoders trained with conventional contrastive learning are prone to learn modality shortcut, leading to poor robustness under distribution shifts. We propose a modality composition awareness framework to mitigate this issue. Concretely, a preference loss enforces multimodal embeddings to outperform their unimodal counterparts, while a composition regularization objective aligns multimodal embeddings with prototypes composed from its unimodal parts. These objectives explicitly model structural relationships between the composed representation and its unimodal counterparts. Experiments on various benchmarks show gains in out-of-distribution retrieval, highlighting modality composition awareness as a effective principle for robust composed multimodal retrieval when utilizing MLLMs as the unified encoder.

Abstract: Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) has been a critical challenge in generative AI. Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup. This work enables a universal approach for draft model selection, making SD a more versatile and practical tool for LLM acceleration.

Abstract: Any piece of knowledge is usually expressed in one or a handful of natural languages on the web or in any large corpus. Large Language Models (LLMs) act as a bridge by acquiring knowledge from a source language and making it accessible when queried from target languages. Prior research has pointed to a cross-lingual gap, viz., a drop in accuracy when the knowledge is queried in a target language compared to when the query is in the source language. Existing research has rationalized divergence in latent representations in source and target languages as the source of cross-lingual gap. In this work, we take an alternative view and hypothesize that the variance of responses in the target language is the main cause of this gap. For the first time, we formalize the cross-lingual gap in terms of bias-variance decomposition. We present extensive experimental evidence which support proposed formulation and hypothesis. We then reinforce our hypothesis through multiple inference-time interventions that control the variance and reduce the cross-lingual gap. We demonstrate a simple prompt instruction to reduce the response variance, which improved target accuracy by 20-25% across different models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at language understanding but often hallucinate and struggle with multi-hop reasoning. Knowledge-graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) offers grounding, yet most methods rely on flat embeddings and noisy path exploration. We propose ParallaxRAG, a framework that symmetrically decouples queries and graph triples into multi-view spaces, enabling a robust retrieval architecture that explicitly enforces head diversity while constraining weakly related paths. Central to our approach is the observation that different attention heads specialize in semantic relations at distinct reasoning stages, contributing to different hops of the reasoning chain. This specialization allows ParallaxRAG to construct cleaner subgraphs and guide LLMs through grounded, step-wise reasoning. Experiments on WebQSP and CWQ, under our unified, reproducible setup (BGE-M3 + Llama3.1-8B), demonstrate competitive retrieval and QA performance, alongside reduced hallucination and good generalization. Our results highlight multi-view head specialization as a principled direction for knowledge-grounded multi-hop reasoning. Our implementation will be released as soon as the paper is accepted.

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date, location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and 1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded, non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains, highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/linty5/ClapperText.

Abstract: The instruction-following capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are pivotal for numerous applications, from conversational agents to complex reasoning systems. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on English models, neglecting the linguistic and cultural nuances of other languages. Specifically, Korean, with its distinct syntax, rich morphological features, honorific system, and dual numbering systems, lacks a dedicated benchmark for assessing open-ended instruction-following capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce the Korean Instruction-following Task Evaluation (KITE), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both general and Korean-specific instructions. Unlike existing Korean benchmarks that focus mainly on factual knowledge or multiple-choice testing, KITE directly targets diverse, open-ended instruction-following tasks. Our evaluation pipeline combines automated metrics with human assessments, revealing performance disparities across models and providing deeper insights into their strengths and weaknesses. By publicly releasing the KITE dataset and code, we aim to foster further research on culturally and linguistically inclusive LLM development and inspire similar endeavors for other underrepresented languages.

Abstract: Speech disorders can significantly affect the patients capability to communicate, learn, and socialize. However, existing speech therapy solutions (e.g., therapist or tools) are still limited and costly, hence such solutions remain inadequate for serving millions of patients worldwide. To address this, state-of-the-art methods employ neural network (NN) algorithms to help accurately detecting speech disorders. However, these methods do not provide therapy recommendation as feedback, hence providing partial solution for patients. Moreover, these methods incur high energy consumption due to their complex and resource-intensive NN processing, hence hindering their deployments on low-power/energy platforms (e.g., smartphones). Toward this, we propose SpikeVox, a novel framework for enabling energy-efficient speech therapy solutions through spike-driven generative language model. Specifically, SpikeVox employs a speech recognition module to perform highly accurate speech-to-text conversion; leverages a spike-driven generative language model to efficiently perform pattern analysis for speech disorder detection and generates suitable exercises for therapy; provides guidance on correct pronunciation as feedback; as well as utilizes the REST API to enable seamless interaction for users. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeVox achieves 88% confidence level on average in speech disorder recognition, while providing a complete feedback for therapy exercises. Therefore, SpikeVox provides a comprehensive framework for energy-efficient speech therapy solutions, and potentially addresses the significant global speech therapy access gap.

Abstract: Creative services teams increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) to accelerate ideation, yet production systems often converge on homogeneous outputs that fail to meet brand or artistic expectations. Art of X developed persona-conditioned LLM agents -- internally branded as "Sparks" and instantiated through a library of role-inspired system prompts -- to intentionally diversify agent behaviour within a multi-agent workflow. This white paper documents the problem framing, experimental design, and quantitative evidence behind the Spark agent programme. Using an LLM-as-a-judge protocol calibrated against human gold standards, we observe a mean diversity gain of +4.1 points (on a 1-10 scale) when persona-conditioned Spark agents replace a uniform system prompt, narrowing the gap to human experts to 1.0 point. We also surface evaluator bias and procedural considerations for future deployments.

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED), addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in microscopy workflows.

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust. Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable, allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

<title>Enhance Large Language Models as Recommendation Systems with Collaborative Filtering</title>

Abstract: As powerful tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs) have been leveraged for crafting recommendations to achieve precise alignment with user preferences and elevate the quality of the recommendations. The existing approaches implement both non-tuning and tuning strategies. Compared to following the tuning strategy, the approaches following the non-tuning strategy avoid the relatively costly, time-consuming, and expertise-requiring process of further training pre-trained LLMs on task-specific datasets, but they suffer the issue of not having the task-specific business or local enterprise knowledge. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing approaches following the non-tuning strategy explicitly integrates collaborative filtering, one of the most successful recommendation techniques. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing critique-based LLMs as recommendation systems (Critic-LLM-RS). For our purpose, we train a separate machine-learning model called Critic that implements collaborative filtering for recommendations by learning from the interactions between many users and items. The Critic provides critiques to LLMs to significantly refine the recommendations. Extensive experiments have verified the effectiveness of Critic-LLM-RS on real datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians' intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of 3D body joint positions synchronized with fisheye camera images, as well as accurate 3D pedestrian positions extracted from lidar data, facilitating robust benchmarking for perception algorithms. We release a portion of the dataset along with a comprehensive benchmark suite, featuring evaluation metrics for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on embedded systems. By addressing real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide baseline performance metrics using custom neural network architectures and suggest future research directions to encourage the adoption and enhancement of the dataset. This work aims to serve as a foundation for researchers seeking to advance the capabilities of intelligent vehicles in near-field scenarios.

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling) improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However, popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$ increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM) retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$), a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning. Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency, with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level sampling strategies such as beam search.

<title>ProofBridge: Auto-Formalization of Natural Language Proofs in Lean via Joint Embeddings</title>

arXiv:2510.15681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translating human-written mathematical theorems and proofs from natural language (NL) into formal languages (FLs) like Lean 4 has long been a significant challenge for AI. Most state-of-the-art methods address this separately, first translating theorems and then generating proofs, creating a fundamental disconnect vis-a-vis true proof auto-formalization. This two-step process and its limitations were evident even in AlphaProof's silver-medal performance at the 2024 IMO, where problem statements needed manual translation before automated proof synthesis.
  We present ProofBridge, a unified framework for automatically translating entire NL theorems and proofs into Lean 4. At its core is a joint embedding model that aligns NL and FL (NL-FL) theorem-proof pairs in a shared semantic space, enabling cross-modal retrieval of semantically relevant FL examples to guide translation. Our training ensures that NL-FL theorems (and their proofs) are mapped close together in this space if and only if the NL-FL pairs are semantically equivalent. ProofBridge integrates retrieval-augmented fine-tuning with iterative proof repair, leveraging Lean's type checker and semantic equivalence feedback to ensure both syntactic correctness and semantic fidelity. Experiments show substantial improvements in proof auto-formalization over strong baselines (including GPT-5, Gemini-2.5, Kimina-Prover, DeepSeek-Prover), with our retrieval-augmented approach yielding significant gains in semantic correctness (SC, via proving bi-directional equivalence) and type correctness (TC, via type-checking theorem+proof) across pass@k metrics on miniF2F-Test-PF, a dataset we curated. In particular, ProofBridge improves cross-modal retrieval quality by up to 3.28x Recall@1 over all-MiniLM-L6-v2, and achieves +31.14% SC and +1.64% TC (pass@32) compared to the baseline Kimina-Prover-RL-1.7B.

Abstract: Dense Retrieval Models (DRMs) are a prominent development in Information Retrieval (IR). A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is that they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains they were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR incorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer layer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of additional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which introduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To assess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical evaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation setups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot generalizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different underlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective test sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform zero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform further experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters (i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this variation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE is particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as TinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning across benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and Contriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve improved retrieval performance. Our code is available online at: https://github.com/FaySokli/SB-MoE.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD, particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for neuro-oncological imaging.

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of 9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved 99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering applications.

Abstract: In quantitative investing, return prediction supports various tasks, including stock selection, portfolio optimization, and risk management. Quantitative factors, such as valuation, quality, and growth, capture various characteristics of stocks. Unstructured financial data, like news and transcripts, has attracted growing attention, driven by recent advances in large language models (LLMs). This paper examines effective methods for leveraging multimodal factors and newsflow in return prediction and stock selection. First, we introduce a fusion learning framework to learn a unified representation from factors and newsflow representations generated by an LLM. Within this framework, we compare three representative methods: representation combination, representation summation, and attentive representations. Next, building on empirical observations from fusion learning, we explore the mixture model that adaptively combines predictions made by single modalities and their fusion. To mitigate the training instability observed in the mixture model, we introduce a decoupled training approach with theoretical insights. Finally, our experiments on real investment universes yield several insights into effective multimodal modeling of factors and news for stock return prediction.

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce, and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs -- struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks, reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as training data for supervised finetuning.

Abstract: Beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has recently been introduced to enable advanced control over electromagnetic waves to further increase the benefits of traditional RIS in enhancing signal quality and improving spectral and energy efficiency for next-generation wireless networks. A significant issue in designing and deploying BD-RIS is the tradeoff between its performance and circuit complexity. Despite some efforts in exploring optimal architectures with the lowest circuit complexities for ideal BD-RIS, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS remains uninvestigated. Therefore, how non-idealities and circuit complexity jointly affect the performance of BD-RIS remains unclear, making it difficult to achieve the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff in the presence of non-idealities. Essentially, architecture discovery for non-ideal BD-RIS faces challenges from both the computational complexity of global architecture search and the difficulty in achieving global optima. To tackle these challenges, we propose a learning-based two-tier architecture discovery framework (LTTADF) consisting of an architecture generator and a performance optimizer to jointly discover optimal architectures of non-ideal BD-RIS given specific circuit complexities, which can effectively explore over a large architecture space while avoiding getting trapped in poor local optima and thus achieving near-optimal solutions for the performance optimization. Numerical results provide valuable insights for deploying non-ideal BD-RIS considering the performance - circuit complexity tradeoff.

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation. We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown in the experiments.

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary, high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise, missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72% to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small, carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in degraded film analysis.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to the true non-Markovian objective.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Autoregressive Models (ARMs). DLMs employ transformer encoders with bidirectional attention, enabling parallel token generation while maintaining competitive performance. Although their efficiency and effectiveness have been extensively studied, the internal mechanisms that govern DLMs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis of DLM attention patterns, focusing on the attention sinking phenomenon, an effect previously observed in various transformer-based architectures. Our findings reveal that DLMs also exhibit attention sinks, but with distinct characteristics. First, unlike in ARMs, the sink positions in DLMs tend to shift throughout the generation process, displaying a dynamic behaviour. Second, while ARMs are highly sensitive to the removal of attention sinks, DLMs remain robust: masking sinks leads to only a minor degradation in performance. These results provide new insights into the inner workings of diffusion-based language models and highlight fundamental differences in how they allocate and utilize attention compared to autoregressive models.

Abstract: Ideal or real - that is the question.In this work, we explore whether principles from game theory can be effectively applied to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). This inquiry is motivated by the growing inadequacy of conventional evaluation practices, which often rely on fixed-format tasks with reference answers and struggle to capture the nuanced, subjective, and open-ended nature of modern LLM behavior. To address these challenges, we propose a novel alternative: automatic mutual evaluation, where LLMs assess each other's output through self-play and peer review. These peer assessments are then systematically compared with human voting behavior to evaluate their alignment with human judgment. Our framework incorporates game-theoretic voting algorithms to aggregate peer reviews, enabling a principled investigation into whether model-generated rankings reflect human preferences. Empirical results reveal both convergences and divergences between theoretical predictions and human evaluations, offering valuable insights into the promises and limitations of mutual evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to jointly integrate mutual evaluation, game-theoretic aggregation, and human-grounded validation for evaluating the capabilities of LLMs.

<title>NDM: A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework against Implicit Sexual Intentions in Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content, especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms, can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent, risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image. Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images, where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Abstract: As image generative models continue to increase not only in their fidelity but also in their ubiquity the development of tools that leverage direct interaction with their internal mechanisms in an interpretable way has received little attention In this work we introduce a system that allows users to develop a better understanding of the model through interaction and experimentation By giving users the ability to replace activation functions of a generative network with parametric ones and a way to set the parameters of these functions we introduce an alternative approach to control the networks output We demonstrate the use of our method on StyleGAN2 and BigGAN networks trained on FFHQ and ImageNet respectively.

Abstract: The recently proposed Anchored-Branched Universal Physics Transformers (AB-UPT) shows strong capabilities to replicate automotive computational fluid dynamics simulations requiring orders of magnitudes less compute than traditional numerical solvers. In this technical report, we add two new datasets to the body of empirically evaluated use-cases of AB-UPT, combining high-quality data generation with state-of-the-art neural surrogates. Both datasets were generated with the Luminary Cloud platform containing automotives (SHIFT-SUV) and aircrafts (SHIFT-Wing). We start by detailing the data generation. Next, we show favorable performances of AB-UPT against previous state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines on both datasets, followed by extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations of our best AB-UPT model. AB-UPT shows strong performances across the board. Notably, it obtains near perfect prediction of integrated aerodynamic forces within seconds from a simple isotopically tesselate geometry representation and is trainable within a day on a single GPU, paving the way for industry-scale applications.

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However, existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting, Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

Abstract: A central challenge in cognitive neuroscience is to explain how semantic and episodic memory, two major forms of declarative memory, typically associated with cortical and hippocampal processing, interact to support learning, recall, and imagination. Despite significant advances, we still lack a unified computational framework that jointly accounts for core empirical phenomena across both semantic and episodic processing domains. Here, we introduce the Generative Episodic-Semantic Integration System (GENESIS), a computational model that formalizes memory as the interaction between two limited-capacity generative systems: a Cortical-VAE, supporting semantic learning and generalization, and a Hippocampal-VAE, supporting episodic encoding and retrieval within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. GENESIS reproduces hallmark behavioral findings, including generalization in semantic memory, recognition, serial recall effects and gist-based distortions in episodic memory, and constructive episodic simulation, while capturing their dynamic interactions. The model elucidates how capacity constraints shape the fidelity and memorability of experiences, how semantic processing introduces systematic distortions in episodic recall, and how episodic replay can recombine previous experiences. Together, these results provide a principled account of memory as an active, constructive, and resource-bounded process. GENESIS thus advances a unified theoretical framework that bridges semantic and episodic memory, offering new insights into the generative foundations of human cognition.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights. DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers, claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23 training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW and Muon.

<title>Enhanced Sentiment Interpretation via a Lexicon-Fuzzy-Transformer Framework</title>

Abstract: Accurately detecting sentiment polarity and intensity in product reviews and social media posts remains challenging due to informal and domain-specific language. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid lexicon-fuzzy-transformer framework that combines rule-based heuristics, contextual deep learning, and fuzzy logic to generate continuous sentiment scores reflecting both polarity and strength. The pipeline begins with VADER-based initial sentiment estimations, which are refined through a two-stage adjustment process. This involves leveraging confidence scores from DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer and applying fuzzy logic principles to mitigate excessive neutrality bias and enhance granularity. A custom fuzzy inference system then maps the refined scores onto a 0 to 1 continuum, producing expert)like judgments. The framework is rigorously evaluated on four domain-specific datasets. food delivery, e-commerce, tourism, and fashion. Results show improved alignment with user ratings, better identification of sentiment extremes, and reduced misclassifications. Both quantitative metrics (distributional alignment, confusion matrices) and qualitative insights (case studies, runtime analysis) affirm the models robustness and efficiency. This work demonstrates the value of integrating symbolic reasoning with neural models for interpretable, finegrained sentiment analysis in linguistically dynamic domains.

<title>Self-Certifying Primal-Dual Optimization Proxies for Large-Scale Batch Economic Dispatch</title>

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems. However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown substantial advances through reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in domains where rewards can be programmatically verified, such as mathematics and code. In these areas, models benefit from a well-defined operational base guided by explicit rule-based objectives. However, this progress reveals a significant limitation: in open-ended domains where rewards are ambiguous, subjective, or context-dependent, such as creative writing, scientific reasoning, and notably medical consultation, robust reward functions are lacking, making these areas challenging for current RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework specifically designed for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates syn- thetic dialogue generation with the dynamic creation of rubrics, employing these rubrics to direct an incremental RL process. In particular, this approach does not depend on external medical knowledge or manual rules, instead utilizing rubric-guided feedback to shape learning. When implemented on the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, our method can greatly enhance its performance on the HealthBench-Hard benchmark from 7.0 to 27.2 using only 2k samples, thus achieving state-of-the-art results for models of this scale. Our analysis confirms that rubric-driven RL fos-ters consistent performance gains across diverse consultation scenarios, going beyond simple numerical improvements. These findings underscore rubric-based feedback as a scalable strategy for advancing LLMs in intricate, open-ended tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are moving beyond static uses and are now powering agents that learn continually during their interaction with external environments. For example, agents can learn reusable skills while navigating web pages or toggling new tools. However, existing methods for skill learning often create skills that are over-specialized to a single website and fail to generalize. We introduce PolySkill, a new framework that enables agents to learn generalizable and compositional skills. The core idea, inspired by polymorphism in software engineering, is to decouple a skill's abstract goal (what it accomplishes) and its concrete implementation (how it is executed). Experiments show that our method (1) improves skill reuse by 1.7x on seen websites and (2) boosts success rates by up to 9.4% on Mind2Web and 13.9% on unseen websites, while reducing steps by over 20%. (3) In self-exploration settings without specified tasks, our framework improves the quality of proposed tasks and enables agents to learn generalizable skills that work across different sites. By enabling the agent to identify and refine its own goals, the PolySkill enhances the agent's ability to learn a better curriculum, leading to the acquisition of more generalizable skills compared to baseline methods. This work provides a practical path toward building agents capable of continual learning in adaptive environments. Our findings show that separating a skill's goal from its execution is a crucial step toward developing autonomous agents that can learn and generalize across the open web continuously.

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are driving advancements in artificial intelligence by increasing the scale of model parameters, which has significantly enhanced generalization ability and unlocked new capabilities in practice. However, their performance in specific downstream tasks is usually hindered by their knowledge boundaries on these tasks. Thus, fine-tuning techniques, especially the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, have been introduced to expand the boundaries on these tasks, whereas LoRA would underperform on certain tasks owing to its potential overfitting on these tasks. To overcome this overfitting and improve the performance of LoRA, we propose the flexible low rank adaptation (Flexora) method to automatically and flexibly select the most important layers needing to be fine-tuned to achieve the best performance on different downstream tasks. Specifically, Flexora firstly frames this layer selection problem as a well-defined hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem, then addresses it using the unrolled differentiation (UD) method, and finally selects the most useful layers based on the optimized hyperparameters. Our extensive experiments on many pretrained models and natural language tasks show that Flexora is able to consistently improve over the existing baselines, indicating the effectiveness of our Flexora in practice. We additionally provide insightful theoretical results and many ablation studies to deliver a comprehensive understanding of our Flexora.

<title>Beyond Static Assumptions: the Predictive Justified Perspective Model for Epistemic Planning</title>

Abstract: Epistemic Planning (EP) is an important research area dedicated to reasoning about the knowledge and beliefs of agents in multi-agent cooperative or adversarial settings. The Justified Perspective (JP) model is the state-of-the-art approach to solving EP problems with efficiency and expressiveness. However, all existing EP methods inherit the static environment assumption from classical planning. This limitation hinders the application of EP in fields such as robotics with multi-agent settings, where the environment contains changing variables.
  In this paper, we propose an extension of the JP model, namely, the Predictive Justified Perspective (PJP) model, to remove this assumption. Instead of assuming that beliefs remain unchanged since the last observation, the PJP model uses all past observations to form predictions about the changing variables. The definition of the prediction function with examples is provided, and it is demonstrated that it can work with arbitrary nesting. We then implemented the PJP model in several well-known domains and compared it with the JP model in the experiments. The results indicated that the PJP model performs exceptionally well across various domains, demonstrating its potential in improving EP applications in robotics.

Abstract: Epistemic planning is the sub-field of AI planning that focuses on changing knowledge and belief. It is important in both multi-agent domains where agents need to have knowledge/belief regarding the environment, but also the beliefs of other agents, including nested beliefs. When modeling knowledge in multi-agent settings, many models face an exponential growth challenge in terms of nested depth. A contemporary method, known as Planning with Perspectives (PWP), addresses these challenges through the use of perspectives and set operations for knowledge. The JP model defines that an agent's belief is justified if and only if the agent has seen evidence that this belief was true in the past and has not seen evidence to suggest that this has changed. The current paper extends the JP model to handle \emph{group belief}, including distributed belief and common belief. We call this the Group Justified Perspective (GJP) model. Using experimental problems crafted by adapting well-known benchmarks to a group setting, we show the efficiency and expressiveness of our GJP model at handling planning problems that cannot be handled by other epistemic planning tools.

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set, CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Abstract: Rapid electrification and decarbonization are increasing the complexity of distribution grid (DG) operation and planning, necessitating advanced computational analyses to ensure reliability and resilience. These analyses depend on disparate workflows comprising complex models, function calls, and data pipelines that require substantial expert knowledge and remain difficult to automate. Workforce and budget constraints further limit utilities' ability to apply such analyses at scale. To address this gap, we build an agentic system PowerChain, which is capable of autonomously performing complex grid analyses. Existing agentic AI systems are typically developed in a bottom-up manner with customized context for predefined analysis tasks; therefore, they do not generalize to tasks that the agent has never seen. In comparison, to generalize to unseen DG analysis tasks, PowerChain dynamically generates structured context by leveraging supervisory signals from self-contained power systems tools (e.g., GridLAB-D) and an optimized set of expert-annotated and verified reasoning trajectories. For complex DG tasks defined in natural language, empirical results on real utility data demonstrate that PowerChain achieves up to a 144/% improvement in performance over baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that should be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, APPs, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose mobile agent that operates across applications. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end pipeline spanning data collection, training, finetuning, efficient inference, and PC/mobile application. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-APP and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile APP support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency and memory across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements on four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher precision of on screen actions, more reliable long horizon task completion, and faster, more resource efficient runtime. By articulating a cohesive position and a reference architecture that closes the loop from data collection, training to finetuning and efficient inference, this paper offers a concrete roadmap for general purpose mobile agent and provides actionable guidance.

Abstract: The sport of fencing, like many other sports, faces challenges in refereeing: subjective calls, human errors, bias, and limited availability in practice environments. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines, including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.

<title>ACON: Optimizing Context Compression for Long-horizon LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic, real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length, as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement. Our code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/acon.

Abstract: Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents a significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems. Current approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction traces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary search - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both accuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual Hierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines hierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and consensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages a positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining objective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a consensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms existing methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing particular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex interdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of structured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based objective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error attribution in multi-agent systems.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings, considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Since its beginnings in the 1940s, automated reasoning by computers has become a tool of ever growing importance in scientific research. So far, the rules underlying automated reasoning have mainly been formulated by humans, in the form of program source code. Rules derived from large amounts of data, via machine learning techniques, are a complementary approach currently under intense development. The question of why we should trust these systems, and the results obtained with their help, has been discussed by philosophers of science but has so far received little attention by practitioners. The present work focuses on independent reviewing, an important source of trust in science, and identifies the characteristics of automated reasoning systems that affect their reviewability. It also discusses possible steps towards increasing reviewability and trustworthiness via a combination of technical and social measures.

Abstract: We introduce MotionScript, a novel framework for generating highly detailed, natural language descriptions of 3D human motions. Unlike existing motion datasets that rely on broad action labels or generic captions, MotionScript provides fine-grained, structured descriptions that capture the full complexity of human movement including expressive actions (e.g., emotions, stylistic walking) and interactions beyond standard motion capture datasets. MotionScript serves as both a descriptive tool and a training resource for text-to-motion models, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and diverse human motions from text. By augmenting motion datasets with MotionScript captions, we demonstrate significant improvements in out-of-distribution motion generation, allowing large language models (LLMs) to generate motions that extend beyond existing data. Additionally, MotionScript opens new applications in animation, virtual human simulation, and robotics, providing an interpretable bridge between intuitive descriptions and motion synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically translate 3D motion into structured natural language without requiring training data.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in image segmentation and object detection, understanding complex scenes remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on graphical humor as a paradigmatic example of image interpretation that requires elucidating the interaction of different scene elements in the context of prior cognitive knowledge. This paper introduces \textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

Abstract: Conditional music generation offers significant advantages in terms of user convenience and control, presenting great potential in AI-generated content research. However, building conditional generative systems for multitrack popular songs presents three primary challenges: insufficient fidelity of input conditions, poor structural modeling, and inadequate inter-track harmony learning in generative models. To address these issues, we propose BandCondiNet, a conditional model based on parallel Transformers, designed to process the multiple music sequences and generate high-quality multitrack samples. Specifically, we propose multi-view features across time and instruments as high-fidelity conditions. Moreover, we propose two specialized modules for BandCondiNet: Structure Enhanced Attention (SEA) to strengthen the musical structure, and Cross-Track Transformer (CTT) to enhance inter-track harmony. We conducted both objective and subjective evaluations on two popular music datasets with different sequence lengths. Objective results on the shorter dataset show that BandCondiNet outperforms other conditional models in 9 out of 10 metrics related to fidelity and inference speed, with the exception of Chord Accuracy. On the longer dataset, BandCondiNet surpasses all conditional models across all 10 metrics. Subjective evaluations across four criteria reveal that BandCondiNet trained on the shorter dataset performs best in Richness and performs comparably to state-of-the-art models in the other three criteria, while significantly outperforming them across all criteria when trained on the longer dataset. To further expand the application scope of BandCondiNet, future work should focus on developing an advanced conditional model capable of adapting to more user-friendly input conditions and supporting flexible instrumentation.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has advanced software engineering tasks but remains underexplored in unit test generation. To bridge this gap, we investigate the efficacy of RAG-based unit test generation for machine learning (ML/DL) APIs and analyze the impact of different knowledge sources on their effectiveness. We examine three domain-specific sources for RAG: (1) API documentation (official guidelines), (2) GitHub issues (developer-reported resolutions), and (3) StackOverflow Q&amp;As (community-driven solutions). Our study focuses on five widely used Python-based ML/DL libraries, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Google JAX, and XGBoost, targeting the most-used APIs. We evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs -- GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, Mistral MoE 8x22B, and Llama 3.1 405B -- across three strategies: basic instruction prompting, Basic RAG, and API-level RAG. Quantitatively, we assess syntactical and dynamic correctness and line coverage. While RAG does not enhance correctness, RAG improves line coverage by 6.5% on average. We found that GitHub issues result in the best improvement in line coverage by providing edge cases from various issues. We also found that these generated unit tests can help detect new bugs. Specifically, 28 bugs were detected, 24 unique bugs were reported to developers, ten were confirmed, four were rejected, and ten are awaiting developers' confirmation. Our findings highlight RAG's potential in unit test generation for improving test coverage with well-targeted knowledge sources. Future work should focus on retrieval techniques that identify documents with unique program states to optimize RAG-based unit test generation further.

<title>Memory-Efficient Large Language Models for Program Repair with Semantic-Guided Patch Generation</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we first show that increases in beam size, even for small-sized LLMs (1B-7B params), require extensive GPU usage, leading to up to 80% of recurring crashes due to memory overloads in LLM-based APR. Seemingly simple solutions to reduce memory consumption are (1) to quantize LLM models, i.e., converting the weights of an LLM from high-precision values to lower-precision ones, and (2) to make beam search sequential, i.e., forwarding each beam through the model sequentially and then concatenating them back into a single output. However, we show that these approaches still do not work via both theoretical analysis and experiments.
  To address this, we introduce FLAMES, a novel LLM-based APR technique that employs semantic-guided patch generation to enhance repair effectiveness and memory efficiency. Unlike conventional methods that rely on beam search, FLAMES utilizes greedy decoding to enhance memory efficiency while steering the search towards more potentially good repair candidates via a semantic-guided best-first search algorithm. At each decoding step, FLAMES uses semantic feedback from test validation, such as the number of passing and failing test cases, to select the most promising token to explore further. Our empirical evaluation on Defects4J shows thatFLAMES substantially reduces memory consumption by up to 83% compared to LLM-based APR without compromising time efficiency. Moreover, FLAMES correctly fixes 133 bugs on Defects4J, fixing 10 bugs more than the best baseline. Additionally, these improvements also generalize to the HumanEval-Java and TransformedD4J datasets, where FLAMES generates 12% and 36.5% more correct patches, respectively, than the best baseline.

Abstract: We present a generative modeling approach based on the variational inference framework for likelihood-free simulation-based inference. The method leverages latent variables within variational autoencoders to efficiently estimate complex posterior distributions arising from stochastic simulations. We explore two variations of this approach distinguished by their treatment of the prior distribution. The first model adapts the prior based on observed data using a multivariate prior network, enhancing generalization across various posterior queries. In contrast, the second model utilizes a standard Gaussian prior, offering simplicity while still effectively capturing complex posterior distributions. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to approximate complex posteriors while maintaining computational efficiency on well-established benchmark problems.

Abstract: Recent evidence, both in the lab and in the wild, suggests that the use of generative artificial intelligence reduces the diversity of content produced. The use of the same or similar AI models appears to lead to more homogeneous behavior. Our work begins with the observation that there is a force pushing in the opposite direction: compe- tition. When producers compete with one another (e.g., for customers or attention), they are incentivized to create novel or unique content. We explore the impact com- petition has on both content diversity and overall social welfare. Through a formal game-theoretic model, we show that competitive markets select for diverse AI models, mitigating monoculture. We further show that a generative AI model that performs well in isolation (i.e., according to a benchmark) may fail to provide value in a compet- itive market. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating generative AI models across the breadth of their output distributions, particularly when they will be deployed in competitive environments. We validate our results empirically by using language models to play Scattergories, a word game in which players are rewarded for answers that are both correct and unique. Overall, our results suggest that homogenization due to generative AI is unlikely to persist in competitive markets, and instead, competition in downstream markets may drive diversification in AI model development

Abstract: TinyML has made deploying deep learning models on low-power edge devices feasible, creating new opportunities for real-time perception in constrained environments. However, the adaptability of such deep learning methods remains limited to data drift adaptation, lacking broader capabilities that account for the environment's underlying dynamics and inherent uncertainty. Deep learning's scaling laws, which counterbalance this limitation by massively up-scaling data and model size, cannot be applied when deploying on the Edge, where deep learning limitations are further amplified as models are scaled down for deployment on resource-constrained devices.
  This paper presents an innovative agentic system capable of performing on-device perception and planning, enabling active sensing on the edge. By incorporating active inference into our solution, our approach extends beyond deep learning capabilities, allowing the system to plan in dynamic environments while operating in real-time with a compact memory footprint of as little as 300 MB. We showcase our proposed system by creating and deploying a saccade agent connected to an IoT camera with pan and tilt capabilities on an NVIDIA Jetson embedded device. The saccade agent controls the camera's field of view following optimal policies derived from the active inference principles, simulating human-like saccadic motion for surveillance and robotics applications.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis plays a crucial role in the fields of organic synthesis and drug development, where the goal is to identify suitable reactants that can yield a target product molecule. Although existing methods have achieved notable success, they typically overlook the 3D conformational details and internal spatial organization of molecules. This oversight makes it challenging to predict reactants that conform to genuine chemical principles, particularly when dealing with complex molecular structures, such as polycyclic and heteroaromatic compounds. In response to this challenge, we introduce a novel transformer-based, template-free approach that incorporates 3D conformer data and spatial information. Our approach includes an Atom-align Fusion module that integrates 3D positional data at the input stage, ensuring correct alignment between atom tokens and their respective 3D coordinates. Additionally, we propose a Distance-weighted Attention mechanism that refines the self-attention process, constricting the model s focus to relevant atom pairs in 3D space. Extensive experiments on the USPTO-50K dataset demonstrate that our model outperforms previous template-free methods, setting a new benchmark for the field. A case study further highlights our method s ability to predict reasonable and accurate reactants.

Abstract: As LLMs increasingly impact safety-critical applications, ensuring their safety using guardrails remains a key challenge. This paper proposes GuardReasoner, a new safeguard for LLMs, by guiding the guard model to learn to reason. Concretely, we first create the GuardReasonerTrain dataset, which consists of 127K samples with 460K detailed reasoning steps. Then, we introduce reasoning SFT to unlock the reasoning capability of guard models. In addition, we present hard sample DPO to further strengthen their reasoning ability. In this manner, GuardReasoner achieves better performance, explainability, and generalizability. Extensive experiments and analyses on 13 benchmarks of 3 guardrail tasks demonstrate its superiority. Remarkably, GuardReasoner 8B surpasses GPT-4o+CoT by 5.74% and LLaMA Guard 3 8B by 20.84% F1 score on average. We release the training data, code, and models with different scales (1B, 3B, 8B) of GuardReasoner : https://github.com/yueliu1999/GuardReasoner/.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is essential for detecting seizures and artifacts in long-term monitoring, with applications spanning hospital diagnostics to wearable health devices. Robust EEG analytics have the potential to greatly improve patient care. However, traditional deep learning models, especially Transformer-based architectures, are hindered by their quadratic time and memory complexity, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we present FEMBA (Foundational EEG Mamba + Bidirectional Architecture), a novel self-supervised framework that establishes new efficiency benchmarks for EEG analysis through bidirectional state-space modeling. Unlike Transformer-based models, which incur quadratic time and memory complexity, FEMBA scales linearly with sequence length, enabling more scalable and efficient processing of extended EEG recordings. Trained on over 21,000 hours of unlabeled EEG and fine-tuned on three downstream tasks, FEMBA achieves competitive performance in comparison with transformer models, with significantly lower computational cost. Specifically, it reaches 81.82% balanced accuracy (0.8921 AUROC) on TUAB and 0.949 AUROC on TUAR, while a tiny 7.8M-parameter variant demonstrates viability for resource-constrained devices. These results pave the way for scalable, general-purpose EEG analytics in both clinical and highlight FEMBA as a promising candidate for wearable applications.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) often causes overfitting to specific prompt wording, where minor phrasing variations drastically reduce performance. To address this, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Fine-Tuning (PAFT), a method that enhances robustness through dynamic prompt variation during training. PAFT first generates diverse synthetic prompts, then continuously samples from this set to construct training instances, forcing models to learn fundamental task principles rather than surface-level patterns. Across systematic evaluations using both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT), PAFT demonstrates substantially improved prompt robustness, achieving 7% higher generalization accuracy on unseen prompts than standard methods. In addition to enhanced robustness, PAFT consistently yields superior overall performance on established benchmarks for question answering, mathematical reasoning, and tool use. Notably, models trained with PAFT attain 3.2 faster inference speeds due to reduced prompt sensitivity. Ablation studies further validate effectiveness of PAFT, while theoretical analysis reveals that PAFT can effectively enhance the cross-domain generalization ability of LLM.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), has enabled the synthesis of high-quality multimedia data. However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have predominantly focused on deepfake detection and often overlook recent advancements in synthetic image forensics, particularly approaches that incorporate multimodal frameworks, reasoning-based detection, and training-free methodologies. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of state-of-the-art techniques for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. The review systematically examines core detection paradigms, categorizes them into spatial-domain, frequency-domain, fingerprint-based, patch-based, training-free, and multimodal reasoning-based frameworks, and offers concise descriptions of their underlying principles. We further provide detailed comparative analyses of these methods on publicly available datasets to assess their generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the potential of hybrid frameworks that combine the efficiency of training-free approaches with the semantic reasoning of multimodal models to advance trustworthy and explainable synthetic image forensics.

<title>Finetuning and Quantization of EEG-Based Foundational BioSignal Models on ECG and PPG Data for Blood Pressure Estimation</title>

Abstract: Blood pressure (BP) is a key indicator of cardiovascular health. As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5x the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5x (from 13.73 MB down to 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.

<title>EMCee: Improving Multilingual Capability of LLMs via Bridging Knowledge and Reasoning with Extracted Synthetic Multilingual Context</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive progress across a wide range of tasks, yet their heavy reliance on English-centric training data leads to significant performance degradation in non-English languages. While existing multilingual prompting methods emphasize reformulating queries into English or enhancing reasoning capabilities, they often fail to incorporate the language- and culture-specific grounding that is essential for some queries. To address this limitation, we propose EMCee (Extracting synthetic Multilingual Context and merging), a simple yet effective framework that enhances the multilingual capabilities of LLMs by explicitly extracting and utilizing query-relevant knowledge from the LLM itself. In particular, EMCee first extracts synthetic context to uncover latent, language-specific knowledge encoded within the LLM, and then dynamically merges this contextual insight with reasoning-oriented outputs through a judgment-based selection mechanism. Extensive experiments on four multilingual benchmarks covering diverse languages and tasks demonstrate that EMCee consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving an average relative improvement of 16.4% overall and 31.7% in low-resource languages.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have achieved promising results in natural language processing. However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

<title>LinEAS: End-to-end Learning of Activation Steering with a Distributional Loss</title>

Abstract: The growing use of generative models in daily life calls for efficient mechanisms to control their generation, to e.g., produce safe content or provide users with tools to explore style changes. Ideally, such mechanisms should require low volume of unpaired data (i.e., without explicit preference), and should be cheap, both at train and inference time, while preserving output quality. Recent research has shown that such mechanisms can be obtained by intervening exclusively on model activations, with the goal of correcting distributional differences between activations seen when using prompts from a source vs. a target set (e.g., toxic and non-toxic sentences). While cheap, these fast methods are inherently crude: their maps are tuned locally, not accounting for their impact on downstream layers, resulting in interventions that cause unintended shifts when used out-of-sample. We propose in this work linear end-to-end activation steering (LinEAS), an approach trained with a global loss that accounts simultaneously for all layer-wise distributional shifts. In addition to being more robust, the loss used to train LinEAS can be regularized with sparsifying norms, which can automatically carry out neuron selection. LinEAS only requires a handful of unpaired samples to be effective, and beats similar baselines on toxicity mitigation in language models, becoming competitive with oracle-dependent methods that have access to strong supervision. LinEAS is modality-agnostic and we empirically find that it outperforms existing activation steering methods at mitigating and including new concepts at the output of single-step text-to-image generation models.

<title>Changing Base Without Losing Pace: A GPU-Efficient Alternative to MatMul in DNNs</title>

arXiv:2503.12211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern AI relies on huge matrix multiplications (MatMuls), whose computation poses a scalability problem for inference and training. We propose an alternative, GPU native bilinear operator to MatMuls in neural networks, which offers a three-way tradeoff between: speed, accuracy and parameter count. In particular, this operator requires substantially fewer FLOPs to evaluate ($\ll n^3$), yet increases the parameter count compared to MatMul ($\gg n^2$). We call this operator Strassen-Tile (STL). The key idea behind STL is a local learnable change-of-basis, applied on tiles of the weight and activation matrices, followed by an element-wise product between the tiles, implemented simultaneously via MatMul. The key technical question we study is how to optimize the change-of-basis of a given layer, which is a highly non-convex problem. We show that theory-backed initializations (inspired by fast matrix and polynomial multiplication) lead to substantially better accuracy than random SGD initialization. This phenomenon motivates further algorithmic study of STL optimization in DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate that STL can approximate 4x4 MatMul of tiles while reducing FLOPs by a factor of 2.66, and can improve Imagenet-1K accuracy of SoTA T2T-ViT-7 (4.3M parameters) while lowering FLOPs. Even with non-CUDA optimized PyTorch code, STL achieves wall-clock speedups in the compute-bound regime. These results, together with its theoretical grounds, suggest STL as a promising building block for scalable and cost-efficient AI.

<title>Beyond Final Code: A Process-Oriented Error Analysis of Software Development Agents in Real-World GitHub Scenarios</title>

arXiv:2503.12374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark.
  Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.

<title>Text2Schema: Filling the Gap in Designing Database Table Structures based on Natural Language</title>

Abstract: People without a database background usually rely on file systems or tools such as Excel for data management, which often lead to redundancy and data inconsistency. Relational databases possess strong data management capabilities, but require a high level of professional expertise from users. Although there are already many works on Text2SQL to automate the translation of natural language into SQL queries for data manipulation, all of them presuppose that the database schema is pre-designed. In practice, schema design itself demands domain expertise, and research on directly generating schemas from textual requirements remains unexplored. In this paper, we systematically define a new problem, called Text2Schema, to convert a natural language text requirement into a relational database schema. With an effective Text2Schema technique, users can effortlessly create database table structures using natural language, and subsequently leverage existing Text2SQL techniques to perform data manipulations, which significantly narrows the gap between non-technical personnel and highly efficient, versatile relational database systems. We propose SchemaAgent, an LLM-based multi-agent framework for Text2Schema. We emulate the workflow of manual schema design by assigning specialized roles to agents and enabling effective collaboration to refine their respective subtasks. We also incorporate dedicated roles for reflection and inspection, along with an innovative error detection and correction mechanism to identify and rectify issues across various phases. Moreover, we build and open source a benchmark containing 381 pairs of requirement description and schema. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over comparative work.

Abstract: This paper challenges the argument that generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is entitled to broad immunity from copyright law for reproducing copyrighted works without authorization due to a fair use defense. It examines fair use legal arguments and eight distinct substantive arguments, contending that every legal and substantive argument favoring fair use for GenAI applies equally, if not more so, to humans. Therefore, granting GenAI exceptional privileges in this domain is legally and logically inconsistent with withholding broad fair use exemptions from individual humans. It would mean no human would need to pay for virtually any copyright work again. The solution is to take a circumspect view of any fair use claim for mass copyright reproduction by any entity and focus on the first principles of whether permitting such exceptionalism for GenAI promotes science and the arts.

Abstract: Generating human videos from a single image while ensuring high visual quality and precise control is a challenging task, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions with objects. Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present \emph{Structural Video Diffusion}, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.

Abstract: Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences in various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time 3D reconstruction of human heads from monocular images and videos underlies numerous visual applications. As 3D ground truth data is hard to come by at scale, previous methods have sought to learn from abundant 2D videos in a self-supervised manner. Typically, this involves the use of differentiable mesh rendering, which is effective but faces limitations. To improve on this, we propose SHeaP (Self-supervised Head Geometry Predictor Learned via 2D Gaussians). Given a source image, we predict a 3DMM mesh and a set of Gaussians that are rigged to this mesh. We then reanimate this rigged head avatar to match a target frame, and backpropagate photometric losses to both the 3DMM and Gaussian prediction networks. We find that using Gaussians for rendering substantially improves the effectiveness of this self-supervised approach. Training solely on 2D data, our method surpasses existing self-supervised approaches in geometric evaluations on the NoW benchmark for neutral faces and a new benchmark for non-neutral expressions. Our method also produces highly expressive meshes, outperforming state-of-the-art in emotion classification.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have led to their application in password guessing, with the aim of replicating the complexity, structure, and patterns of human-created passwords. Despite their potential, inconsistencies and inadequate evaluation methodologies in prior research have hindered meaningful comparisons and a comprehensive, unbiased understanding of their capabilities. This paper introduces MAYA, a unified, customizable, plug-and-play benchmarking framework designed to facilitate the systematic characterization and benchmarking of generative password-guessing models in the context of trawling attacks. Using MAYA, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of six state-of-the-art approaches, which we re-implemented and adapted to ensure standardization. Our evaluation spans eight real-world password datasets and covers an exhaustive set of advanced testing scenarios, totaling over 15,000 compute hours. Our findings indicate that these models effectively capture different aspects of human password distribution and exhibit strong generalization capabilities. However, their effectiveness varies significantly with long and complex passwords. Through our evaluation, sequential models consistently outperform other generative architectures and traditional password-guessing tools, demonstrating unique capabilities in generating accurate and complex guesses. Moreover, the diverse password distributions learned by the models enable a multi-model attack that outperforms the best individual model. By releasing MAYA, we aim to foster further research, providing the community with a new tool to consistently and reliably benchmark generative password-guessing models. Our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/williamcorrias/MAYA-Password-Benchmarking.

Abstract: We present FLUKE (Framework for LingUistically-driven and tasK-agnostic robustness Evaluation), a framework for assessing model robustness through systematic minimal variations of test data. FLUKE introduces controlled variations across linguistic levels -- from orthography to dialect and style -- and leverages large language models (LLMs) with human validation to generate modifications. We demonstrate FLUKE's utility by evaluating both fine-tuned models and LLMs across six diverse NLP tasks (four classification and two generation tasks), and reveal that (1) the impact of linguistic variations is highly task-dependent, with some tests being critical for certain tasks but irrelevant for others; (2) LLMs still exhibit significant brittleness to certain linguistic variations, with reasoning LLMs surprisingly showing less robustness on some tasks compared to base models; (3) models are overall more brittle to natural, fluent modifications such as syntax or style changes (and especially to negation), compared to corruption-style tests such as letter flipping; (4) the ability of a model to use a linguistic feature in generation does not correlate to its robustness to this feature on downstream tasks. These findings highlight the importance of systematic robustness testing for understanding model behaviors.

<title>A Multimodal Deep Learning Approach for White Matter Shape Prediction in Diffusion MRI Tractography</title>

Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.

arXiv:2504.19136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and underexploited spectral complementarity. Existing approaches often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes, resulting in feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in the Fourier domain. This design reinforces shared structures while preserving complementary characteristics, thereby enhancing fusion quality. Unlike previous methods that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency spectra, PAD explicitly introduces amplitude-phase decoupling for multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via convolution-guided scaling to improve geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high- and low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons, effectively exploiting SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AV) offer a cost-effective solution for scientific missions such as underwater tracking. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for multi-target tracking or targets with rapid, unpredictable motion--presents significant computational challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is notoriously sample-inefficient, and while high-fidelity simulators like Gazebo's LRAUV provide 100x faster-than-real-time single-robot simulations, they offer no significant speedup for multi-vehicle scenarios, making MARL training impractical. To address these limitations, we propose an iterative distillation method that transfers high-fidelity simulations into a simplified, GPU-accelerated environment while preserving high-level dynamics. This approach achieves up to a 30,000x speedup over Gazebo through parallelization, enabling efficient training via end-to-end GPU acceleration. Additionally, we introduce a novel Transformer-based architecture (TransfMAPPO) that learns multi-agent policies invariant to the number of agents and targets, significantly improving sample efficiency. Following large-scale curriculum learning conducted entirely on GPU, we perform extensive evaluations in Gazebo, demonstrating that our method maintains tracking errors below 5 meters over extended durations, even in the presence of multiple fast-moving targets. This work bridges the gap between large-scale MARL training and high-fidelity deployment, providing a scalable framework for autonomous fleet control in real-world sea missions.

Abstract: Prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) have emerged as promising foundation models for prediction from tabular data sets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on small to moderate data sizes without tuning. While PFNs are motivated by Bayesian ideas, they do not provide any uncertainty quantification for predictive means, quantiles, or similar quantities. We propose a principled and efficient sampling procedure to construct Bayesian posteriors for such estimates based on Martingale posteriors, and prove its convergence. Several simulated and real-world data examples showcase the uncertainty quantification of our method in inference applications.

arXiv:2505.11717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. In this work, we propose WebInject, a prompt injection attack that manipulates the webpage environment to induce a web agent to perform an attacker-specified action. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the attacker-specified action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets shows that WebInject is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1) Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to semantically grounded verification.

<title>UNet with Self-Adaptive Mamba-Like Attention and Causal-Resonance Learning for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical applications; however, existing deep learning models face trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) capture local details well but miss the global context, whereas transformers handle the global context but at a high computational cost. Recently, State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have shown potential for capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity; however, their direct use in medical image segmentation remains limited due to incompatibility with image structures and autoregressive assumptions. To overcome these challenges, we propose SAMA-UNet, a novel U-shaped architecture that introduces two key innovations. First, the Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block adaptively integrates local and global features through dynamic attention weighting, enabling an efficient representation of complex anatomical patterns. Second, the causal resonance multi-scale module (CR-MSM) improves encoder-decoder interactions by adjusting feature resolution and causal dependencies across scales, enhancing the semantic alignment between low- and high-level features. Extensive experiments on MRI, CT, and endoscopy datasets demonstrate that SAMA-UNet consistently outperforms CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods. It achieves 85.38% DSC and 87.82% NSD on BTCV, 92.16% and 96.54% on ACDC, 67.14% and 68.70% on EndoVis17, and 84.06% and 88.47% on ATLAS23, establishing new benchmarks across modalities. These results confirm the effectiveness of SAMA-UNet in combining efficiency and accuracy, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical segmentation tasks.

<title>DiEmo-TTS: Disentangled Emotion Representations via Self-Supervised Distillation for Cross-Speaker Emotion Transfer in Text-to-Speech</title>

arXiv:2505.19687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-speaker emotion transfer in speech synthesis relies on extracting speaker-independent emotion embeddings for accurate emotion modeling without retaining speaker traits. However, existing timbre compression methods fail to fully separate speaker and emotion characteristics, causing speaker leakage and degraded synthesis quality. To address this, we propose DiEmo-TTS, a self-supervised distillation method to minimize emotional information loss and preserve speaker identity. We introduce cluster-driven sampling and information perturbation to preserve emotion while removing irrelevant factors. To facilitate this process, we propose an emotion clustering and matching approach using emotional attribute prediction and speaker embeddings, enabling generalization to unlabeled data. Additionally, we designed a dual conditioning transformer to integrate style features better. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in learning speaker-irrelevant emotion embeddings.

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition predicts a speaker's emotional state from speech signals using discrete labels or continuous dimensions such as arousal, valence, and dominance (VAD). We propose EmoSphere-SER, a joint model that integrates spherical VAD region classification to guide VAD regression for improved emotion prediction. In our framework, VAD values are transformed into spherical coordinates that are divided into multiple spherical regions, and an auxiliary classification task predicts which spherical region each point belongs to, guiding the regression process. Additionally, we incorporate a dynamic weighting scheme and a style pooling layer with multi-head self-attention to capture spectral and temporal dynamics, further boosting performance. This combined training strategy reinforces structured learning and improves prediction consistency. Experimental results show that our approach exceeds baseline methods, confirming the validity of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for tackling complex tasks through collaborative intelligence. However, the topology of these systems--how agents in MASs should be configured, connected, and coordinated--remains largely unexplored. In this position paper, we call for a paradigm shift toward \emph{topology-aware MASs} that explicitly model and dynamically optimize the structure of inter-agent interactions. We identify three fundamental components--agents, communication links, and overall topology--that collectively determine the system's adaptability, efficiency, robustness, and fairness. To operationalize this vision, we introduce a systematic three-stage framework: 1) agent selection, 2) structure profiling, and 3) topology synthesis. This framework not only provides a principled foundation for designing MASs but also opens new research frontiers across language modeling, reinforcement learning, graph learning, and generative modeling to ultimately unleash their full potential in complex real-world applications. We conclude by outlining key challenges and opportunities in MASs evaluation. We hope our framework and perspectives offer critical new insights in the era of agentic AI.

<title>Hyperbolic Dataset Distillation</title>

arXiv:2505.24623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the computational and storage challenges posed by large-scale datasets in deep learning, dataset distillation has been proposed to synthesize a compact dataset that replaces the original while maintaining comparable model performance. Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level optimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning the distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested optimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean space, treat data as independent and identically distributed points, overlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed HDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential volume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like structures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz hyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is measured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By optimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated into the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards the root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving their underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning in hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model performance, while significantly improving training stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate the hyperbolic space into the dataset distillation process. The code is available at https://github.com/Guang000/HDD.

arXiv:2506.02515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-step symbolic reasoning is essential for robust financial analysis; yet, current benchmarks largely overlook this capability. Existing datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA emphasize final numerical answers while neglecting the intermediate reasoning required for transparency and verification. To address this gap, we introduce FinChain, the first benchmark specifically designed for verifiable Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation in finance. FinChain spans 58 topics across 12 financial domains, each represented by parameterized symbolic templates with executable Python traces that enable fully machine-verifiable reasoning and scalable, contamination-free data generation. To assess reasoning capacity, we propose ChainEval, a dynamic alignment metric that jointly evaluates both the final-answer correctness and the step-level reasoning consistency. Evaluating 26 leading LLMs reveals that even frontier proprietary systems exhibit clear limitations in symbolic financial reasoning, while domain-adapted and math-enhanced fine-tuned models substantially narrow this gap. Overall, FinChain exposes persistent weaknesses in multi-step financial reasoning and provides a foundation for developing trustworthy, interpretable, and verifiable financial AI.

<title>When Does Closeness in Distribution Imply Representational Similarity? An Identifiability Perspective</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03784</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2506.03784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When and why representations learned by different deep neural networks are similar is an active research topic. We choose to address these questions from the perspective of identifiability theory, which suggests that a measure of representational similarity should be invariant to transformations that leave the model distribution unchanged. Focusing on a model family which includes several popular pre-training approaches, e.g., autoregressive language models, we explore when models which generate distributions that are close have similar representations. We prove that a small Kullback--Leibler divergence between the model distributions does not guarantee that the corresponding representations are similar. This has the important corollary that models with near-maximum data likelihood can still learn dissimilar representations -- a phenomenon mirrored in our experiments with models trained on CIFAR-10. We then define a distributional distance for which closeness implies representational similarity, and in synthetic experiments, we find that wider networks learn distributions which are closer with respect to our distance and have more similar representations. Our results thus clarify the link between closeness in distribution and representational similarity.

arXiv:2506.05342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

<title>MOBODY: Model Based Off-Dynamics Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2506.08460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning, where the goal is to learn a policy from offline source and limited target datasets with mismatched dynamics. Existing methods either penalize the reward or discard source transitions occurring in parts of the transition space with high dynamics shift. As a result, they optimize the policy using data from low-shift regions, limiting exploration of high-reward states in the target domain that do not fall within these regions. Consequently, such methods often fail when the dynamics shift is significant or the optimal trajectories lie outside the low-shift regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose MOBODY, a Model-Based Off-Dynamics Offline RL algorithm that optimizes a policy using learned target dynamics transitions to explore the target domain, rather than only being trained with the low dynamics-shift transitions. For the dynamics learning, built on the observation that achieving the same next state requires taking different actions in different domains, MOBODY employs separate action encoders for each domain to encode different actions to the shared latent space while sharing a unified representation of states and a common transition function. We further introduce a target Q-weighted behavior cloning loss in policy optimization to avoid out-of-distribution actions, which push the policy toward actions with high target-domain Q-values, rather than high source domain Q-values or uniformly imitating all actions in the offline dataset. We evaluate MOBODY on a wide range of MuJoCo and Adroit benchmarks, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art off-dynamics RL baselines as well as policy learning methods based on different dynamics learning baselines, with especially pronounced improvements in challenging scenarios where existing methods struggle.

arXiv:2506.09080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial decision-making presents unique challenges for language models, demanding temporal reasoning, adaptive risk assessment, and responsiveness to dynamic events. While large language models (LLMs) show strong general reasoning capabilities, they often fail to capture behavioral patterns central to human financial decisions-such as expert reliance under information asymmetry, loss-averse sensitivity, and feedback-driven temporal adjustment. We propose FinHEAR, a multi-agent framework for Human Expertise and Adaptive Risk-aware reasoning. FinHEAR orchestrates specialized LLM-based agents to analyze historical trends, interpret current events, and retrieve expert-informed precedents within an event-centric pipeline. Grounded in behavioral economics, it incorporates expert-guided retrieval, confidence-adjusted position sizing, and outcome-based refinement to enhance interpretability and robustness. Empirical results on curated financial datasets show that FinHEAR consistently outperforms strong baselines across trend prediction and trading tasks, achieving higher accuracy and better risk-adjusted returns.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, concerns about their misconduct in complex social contexts intensify. Existing research overlooked the systematic understanding and assessment of their criminal capability in realistic interactions. We propose a unified framework PRISON, to quantify LLMs' criminal potential across five traits: False Statements, Frame-Up, Psychological Manipulation, Emotional Disguise, and Moral Disengagement. Using structured crime scenarios adapted from classic films grounded in reality, we evaluate both criminal potential and anti-crime ability of LLMs. Results show that state-of-the-art LLMs frequently exhibit emergent criminal tendencies, such as proposing misleading statements or evasion tactics, even without explicit instructions. Moreover, when placed in a detective role, models recognize deceptive behavior with only 44% accuracy on average, revealing a striking mismatch between conducting and detecting criminal behavior. These findings underscore the urgent need for adversarial robustness, behavioral alignment, and safety mechanisms before broader LLM deployment.

arXiv:2506.17462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed information flows, limiting their generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge for reasoning and planning, but prior LVLM-robot integrations have largely depended on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and rigid control logic. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools drawn from modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select navigation actions. This agentic formulation enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, offering a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA outperforms state-of-the-art EQA-specific approaches. Qualitative results on RxR and custom tasks further demonstrate its ability to generalize across a broad range of navigation challenges.

arXiv:2506.17719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conflicting experiments disagree on whether the titanium-vanadium (Ti-V) binary alloy exhibits a body-centred cubic (BCC) miscibility gap or remains completely soluble. A leading hypothesis attributes the miscibility gap to oxygen contamination during alloy preparation. To resolve this disagreement, we use an ab initio + machine-learning workflow that couples an actively-trained Moment Tensor Potential with Bayesian inference of free energy surface. This workflow enables construction of the Ti-V phase diagram across the full composition range with systematically reduced statistical and finite-size errors. The resulting diagram reproduces all experimental features, demonstrating the robustness of our approach, and clearly favors the variant with a BCC miscibility gap terminating at T = 980 K and c = 0.67. Because our simulations model a perfectly oxygen-free Ti-V system, the observed gap cannot originate from impurity effects, in contrast to recent CALPHAD reassessments.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents excel in solving complex decision-making tasks across various domains. However, they often require a substantial number of training steps and a vast experience replay buffer, leading to significant computational and resource demands. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel theoretical result that leverages the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework into DRL. Unlike most methods that focus on bounding the counterfactual loss, we establish a causal bound on the factual loss, which is analogous to the on-policy loss in DRL. This bound is computed by storing past value network outputs in the experience replay buffer, effectively utilizing data that is usually discarded. Extensive experiments across the Atari 2600 and MuJoCo domains on various agents, such as DQN and SAC, achieve up to 383% higher reward ratio, outperforming the same agents without our proposed term, and reducing the experience replay buffer size by up to 96%, significantly improving sample efficiency at a negligible cost.

Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics. Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

Abstract: Clothes manipulation, such as folding or hanging, is a critical capability for home service robots. Despite recent advances, most existing methods remain limited to specific clothes types and tasks, due to the complex, high-dimensional geometry of clothes. This paper presents CLothes mAnipulation with Semantic keyPoints (CLASP), which aims at general-purpose clothes manipulation over diverse clothes types, T-shirts, shorts, skirts, long dresses, ..., as well as different tasks, folding, flattening, hanging, .... The core idea of CLASP is semantic keypoints-e.g., ''left sleeve'' and ''right shoulder''-a sparse spatial-semantic representation, salient for both perception and action. Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably extracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective representation for a wide range of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints as an intermediate representation to connect high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high level, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the semantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a set of pre-built manipulation skills conditioned on the keypoints. Extensive simulation experiments show that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks across diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and generalization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four distinct tasks-folding, flattening, hanging, and placing-confirm CLASP's performance on real-life clothes manipulation.

Abstract: Large language models represent significant investments in computation, data, and engineering expertise, making them extraordinarily valuable intellectual assets. Nevertheless, these AI assets remain vulnerable to unauthorized redistribution and commercial exploitation through fine-tuning or black-box deployment. Current fingerprinting approaches face a fundamental trade-off: intrinsic methods require full parameter access, while backdoor-based techniques employ statistically anomalous triggers easily detected and filtered by adversaries. To address these limitations, we introduce FPEdit, a novel framework that leverages knowledge editing to inject semantically coherent natural language fingerprints through sparse, targeted modifications to model weights. Our approach introduces Promote-Suppress Value Vector Optimization, which simultaneously enhances target token likelihood while suppressing competing tokens, ensuring robust fingerprint integration without degrading core model functionality. Extensive experiments show that FPEdit achieves 95-100% fingerprint retention under both full-parameter fine-tuning and parameter-efficient adaptation, while preserving performance on downstream benchmarks. Moreover, FPEdit remains robust under quantization, pruning, and stochastic decoding, and can embed 10 fingerprint pairs into LLaMA2-7B in under 2 minutes using less than 30 GB of GPU memory, which represents a substantial reduction in resource requirements. These advances establish FPEdit as the first fingerprinting approach to simultaneously achieve robustness against adaptation, resistance to detection, and preservation of model utility, thereby providing a minimally invasive solution for reliable provenance verification of large language models in adversarial deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have rendered visible the fragility of contemporary knowledge infrastructures by simulating coherence while bypassing traditional modes of citation, authority, and validation. This paper introduces the Situated Epistemic Infrastructures (SEI) framework as a diagnostic tool for analyzing how knowledge becomes authoritative across hybrid human-machine systems under post-coherence conditions. Rather than relying on stable scholarly domains or bounded communities of practice, SEI traces how credibility is mediated across institutional, computational, and temporal arrangements. Integrating insights from infrastructure studies, platform theory, and epistemology, the framework foregrounds coordination over classification, emphasizing the need for anticipatory and adaptive models of epistemic stewardship. The paper contributes to debates on AI governance, knowledge production, and the ethical design of information systems by offering a robust alternative to representationalist models of scholarly communication.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of transformers fundamentally limits reasoning system deployment in resource-constrained and long-context settings. We introduce Hydra, a modular architecture based upon a state-space backbone which adaptively routes between complementary efficiency mechanisms: sparse global attention, mixture-of-experts, and dual memories comprising a reasoning workspace and product key memory. We evaluate a 29M parameter model measuring logical chaining accuracy and throughput on synthetic sequences, plus throughput on WikiText. Ablation studies use component-specific synthetic datasets to isolate individual mechanisms. Hydra achieves $3.01\times$ and $3.0\times$ throughput gains at 8K tokens for synthetic and WikiText datasets, respectively, and $10\times$ accuracy improvements on multi-step logical composition compared to equal-sized transformers. Ablations confirm each component's contribution: sparse attention captures long-range dependencies, experts specialize to input domains, and product key memory enables selective retrieval.

<title>GradES: Significantly Faster Training in Transformers with Gradient-Based Early Stopping</title>

Abstract: Early stopping monitors global validation loss and halts all parameter updates simultaneously, which is computationally costly for large transformers due to the extended time required for validation inference. We propose \textit{GradES}, a novel gradient-based early stopping approach that operates within transformer components (attention projections and Feed-Forward layer matrices). We found that different components converge at varying rates during fine-tuning for both language and vision-language models. \textit{GradES} tracks the magnitude of gradient changes in backpropagation for these matrices during training. When a projection matrix's magnitude of gradient changes fall below a convergence threshold $\tau$, we exclude that projection matrix from further updates individually, eliminating costly validation passes while allowing slow converging matrices to continue learning. \textit{GradES} speeds up training time by 1.57--7.22$\times$ while simultaneously enhancing generalization through early prevention of overfitting, resulting in 1.2\% higher average accuracy in language tasks and 3.88\% on multimodal benchmarks.

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models. We introduce a general-purpose drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal accuracy. Within frameworks of Convolutional Neural Networks, lmKAN-based CNNs cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets, respectively. Our code, including dedicated CUDA kernels, is available online at https://github.com/schwallergroup/lmkan.

<title>The Choice of Divergence: A Neglected Key to Mitigating Diversity Collapse in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07430</link>

arXiv:2509.07430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective: using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework, Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences (like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

<title>Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031</link>

arXiv:2509.13031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

arXiv:2509.16391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific "forget" data from a trained model while preserving its knowledge of the remaining "retain" data. Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this, we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically, CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning. Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines empowers their unlearning effectiveness.

<title>A Framework for Rapidly Developing and Deploying Protection Against Large Language Model Attacks</title>

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI deployment, enabling autonomous and semi-autonomous applications across industries through intuitive language interfaces and continuous improvements in model development. However, the attendant increase in autonomy and expansion of access permissions among AI applications also make these systems compelling targets for malicious attacks. Their inherent susceptibility to security flaws necessitates robust defenses, yet no known approaches can prevent zero-day or novel attacks against LLMs. This places AI protection systems in a category similar to established malware protection systems: rather than providing guaranteed immunity, they minimize risk through enhanced observability, multi-layered defense, and rapid threat response, supported by a threat intelligence function designed specifically for AI-related threats.
  Prior work on LLM protection has largely evaluated individual detection models rather than end-to-end systems designed for continuous, rapid adaptation to a changing threat landscape. We present a production-grade defense system rooted in established malware detection and threat intelligence practices. Our platform integrates three components: a threat intelligence system that turns emerging threats into protections; a data platform that aggregates and enriches information while providing observability, monitoring, and ML operations; and a release platform enabling safe, rapid detection updates without disrupting customer workflows. Together, these components deliver layered protection against evolving LLM threats while generating training data for continuous model improvement and deploying updates without interrupting production.

<title>InfiR2: A Comprehensive FP8 Training Recipe for Reasoning-Enhanced Language Models</title>

arXiv:2509.22536v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe. To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a 160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16 baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize large-scale model training.

<title>CCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Radiology MLLMs via Clinical Contrastive Decoding</title>

arXiv:2509.23379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

<title>Tequila: Trapping-free Ternary Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23809</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization. To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct, meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

arXiv:2509.26242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications. However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training. In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by 91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

<title>Ascent Fails to Forget</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

arXiv:2509.26490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios, existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at https://vitabench.github.io/

arXiv:2510.00495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift and driftless. This yields closed- form survival and hazard functions and captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional- hazards. We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art approach, while maintaining a physics- based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena in complex systems

<title>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable yet Noisy Rewards under Imperfect Verifiers</title>

arXiv:2510.00915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives} (rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical $\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward} correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an \textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a \textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI have highlighted its application in captology, the field of using computers as persuasive technologies. We hypothesized that the "conformity effect," where individuals align with others' actions, also occurs with AI agents. This study verifies this hypothesis by introducing a "Persuadee Agent" that is persuaded alongside a human participant in a three-party persuasive dialogue with a Persuader Agent. We conducted a text-based dialogue experiment with human participants. We compared four conditions manipulating the Persuadee Agent's behavior (persuasion acceptance vs. non-acceptance) and the presence of an icebreaker session. Results showed that when the Persuadee Agent accepted persuasion, both perceived persuasiveness and actual attitude change significantly improved. Attitude change was greatest when an icebreaker was also used, whereas an unpersuaded AI agent suppressed attitude change. Additionally, it was confirmed that the persuasion acceptance of participants increased at the moment the Persuadee Agent was persuaded. These results suggest that appropriately designing a Persuadee Agent can improve persuasion through the conformity effect.

arXiv:2510.05092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled weight diffs to train a DIT-adapter, which can be applied to a compatible finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities. Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models, followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists.

<title>Do Audio LLMs Really LISTEN, or Just Transcribe? Measuring Lexical vs. Acoustic Emotion Cues Reliance</title>

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models (LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict. In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal models.

<title>Optimally Deep Networks - Adapting Model Depth to Datasets for Superior Efficiency</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2 (CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories: clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs. These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

The article introduces RADiAnce, a novel framework for designing protein binders targeting specific sites in drug discovery. RADiAnce leverages known interfaces to guide the design of novel binders by unifying retrieval and generation in a shared contrastive latent space. The model efficiently identifies relevant interfaces for a given binding site and integrates them through a conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface transfer. In extensive experiments, RADiAnce outperforms baseline models in metrics such as binding affinity, recovery of geometries, and interactions.

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments, enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug discovery.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to enhance reasoning ability, but often face policy entropy collapse. Entropy regularization is a common solution, but its effectiveness varies across tasks and models. This study proposes Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER) to dynamically balance exploration and exploitation by allocating coefficients based on task difficulty, maintaining target entropy levels, and adjusting global coefficients. Experiments show that AER consistently outperforms baselines on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving reasoning accuracy and exploration capability. Tasks of different difficulties require distinct exploration intensities, and balanced exploration may necessitate maintaining policy entropy within a moderate range below its initial level. <div>

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

<div> Machine Learning, Large-Language Model, Mutual Information, Alignment, Optimization <br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces ENIGMA, an innovative approach to training Large-Language Models (LLMs) that enhances reasoning, alignment, and robustness by incorporating an organization's policies as directions on the model's information manifold. ENIGMA combines Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an on-policy RL method, with CoT-format rewards, Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI) auxiliary, and an entropic Sinkhorn regularizer for geometry drift. New infoNCE metrics gauge a model's adherence to policies, including a Sufficiency Index (SI) for principled principle selection. Experimental results on small LLMs show improved performance with high-SI principles and validate structural changes in the model's manifold. ENIGMA's holistic approach suggests that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are interconnected through information geometry, promoting principled decision-making without explicit reward models for more reliable model training.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information (SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a single information-geometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a path to trusted capability

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

Summary: <br />
State-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems typically focus on acoustic information, neglecting the benefits of incorporating multi-modal context. This study addresses the integration of visual information from presentation slides alongside speaker images to enhance ASR performance, particularly in scientific presentations. A benchmark for multi-modal presentation analysis was created, including domain-specific terminology transcription. The researchers experimented with methods to augment speech models with multi-modal information, compensating for the limited dataset availability by using data augmentation techniques. Training a model with the augmented dataset led to a significant reduction in word error rate, with a 34% improvement across all words and a 35% enhancement for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline model. The results highlight the potential of leveraging multi-modal context in ASR systems to improve accuracy and adaptability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context. However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation. While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset, resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%, across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline model.

Summary:  
Large language models (LLMs) are being studied for their ability to make causal inferences. A study was conducted to see if LLMs develop causal illusions, like humans do, when faced with the contingency judgment task. A dataset of null contingency scenarios in medical contexts was constructed for this purpose. The study found that all evaluated LLMs inferred unwarranted causal relationships, indicating a susceptibility to the illusion of causality. There is ongoing debate about whether LLMs truly understand causality or simply reproduce causal language, with these findings supporting the latter hypothesis. Concerns are raised about using LLMs in domains where accurate causal reasoning is crucial for informed decision-making.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice, stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work, we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality. While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed decision-making.

The article introduces GammaZero, a framework for learning to assist in planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). It uses a unified graph-based belief representation that allows for generalization across different problem sizes within a domain. By transforming belief states into action-centric graphs, it enables learning on small problems to transfer to larger instances. A graph neural network with a decoder architecture is used to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on manageable problems, which are then applied to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results show that GammaZero performs comparably to BetaZero on the same-sized problems and can generalize to 2-4 times larger problems than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems, while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced search requirements.

Summary: 
This paper proposes a regulatory approach to ensure AI safety while promoting innovation by mandating large AI laboratories to release small, openly accessible analog models that are trained similarly to their proprietary models. These analog models serve as public proxies, allowing for broad participation in safety verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without the need for labs to disclose their full-scale models. Research has shown that methods developed using these smaller models can effectively generalize to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider research community to investigate and innovate upon accessible analogs, this policy reduces regulatory burden and accelerates safety advancements. The mandate is cost-efficient, leveraging reusable resources, and contributes significantly to the public good. This approach supports fundamental research in machine learning by illustrating that deeper understanding of models can lead to both enhanced safety and innovation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have more of both.

<div> MDP, consensus statement, fairness guarantees, social choice theory, language models <br />

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach for generating consensus statements using multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP). Each agent's preference is modeled as an objective, and rewards are derived from their policies. The MDP formulation allows for analysis using principles from social choice theory. Two approaches are proposed: a stochastic generation policy in the ex-ante core for overall fairness and maximizing egalitarian welfare for single statement generation. Empirical experiments demonstrate that the egalitarian objective yields consensus statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to existing methods, including the Habermas Machine. This framework provides a structured and principled way to generate consensus statements with fairness guarantees, addressing the limitations of current approaches using large language models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.14106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory. First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare). Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework. Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

It addresses challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies, ensuring operational safety, and managing system complexity. STEMS integrates a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework with a safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm, incorporating Control Barrier Functions for safety guarantees. Experimental results on real-world building datasets show that STEMS outperforms existing methods, achieving significant cost and emission reductions while reducing safety violations and maintaining optimal occupant comfort. The framework exhibits robustness in extreme weather conditions and across various building types. STEMS demonstrates a 21% cost reduction, an 18% emission reduction, and a decrease in safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6%, with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. <div>

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals, improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems. Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees, and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management. STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and maintains effectiveness across different building types.

<title>Formalizing the Safety, Security, and Functional Properties of Agentic AI Systems</title>

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical, especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion, providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together, these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17 properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic, these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

<div> Keywords: Cultural heritage, degradation prediction, multimodal architecture, sensor data, visual imagery

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel approach for monitoring and predicting degradation at cultural heritage sites, addressing the limitations of traditional unimodal methods. By combining sensor data (temperature, humidity) and visual imagery, a lightweight multimodal architecture is proposed, utilizing a simplified encoder and Adaptive Barlow Twins loss to enhance modality complementarity. The model, applied to data from Strasbourg Cathedral, achieves a high accuracy of 76.9%, outperforming existing multimodal architectures. Ablation studies confirm the synergy of sensor and image data, highlighting the effectiveness of multimodal learning. Hyperparameter optimization identifies a balance between alignment and complementarity, further improving prediction accuracy. This work demonstrates the potential of AI-driven conservation decision support systems in heritage monitoring, emphasizing the importance of architectural simplicity and contrastive regularization for effective multimodal learning in data-limited scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change, yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature, humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37 training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO. Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau} =0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9: 61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con- servation decision support systems.

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial video game ``The Last of Us".

<div> Keywords: clinical orders, ambient dialogue, JEDA, domain-initialized bi-encoder, query-free mode<br />
<br />
Summary: 
JEDA (Joint Embedding for Direct and Ambient clinical orders) is a domain-initialized bi-encoder that retrieves clinical orders directly and encodes ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval in a query-free mode. It aligns expressions of intent to shared order concepts by utilizing a duplicate-safe contrastive objective and constrained LLM guidance during training. The query-free mode of JEDA reduces sensitivity to noise and errors, offering noise-resilient performance. In practice, JEDA outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders, providing fast, interpretable, and LLM-free retrieval of clinical orders in real time. This innovative approach enhances efficiency in clinical conversations by linking ambient context to actionable orders seamlessly. JEDA's architecture fosters clarity in inter-order separation, tight query-order coupling, and strong generalization, making it a valuable tool for improving communication and decision-making in healthcare settings. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability, and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning), producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient, reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders (Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs). Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification -- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks; and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot generalization.

Summary: This study introduces the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark, which includes a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset and multi-agent simulation using repeated game theory to test jailbreak methods on Large Language Models LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-flash. The results show that jailbreak tuning increases the success rate of harassment attacks significantly, with insults and flaming being prevalent toxic behaviors. The study reveals that attacked agents exhibit human-like aggression profiles and distinct escalation trajectories, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. The findings highlight the importance of developing robust safety guardrails to protect against harassment and ensure responsible online platforms. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim) simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs, LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama, and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with 84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs. 31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

Summary: 
Deep research is an important frontier for agentic systems, requiring the ability to search and synthesize information from numerous web sources to produce comprehensive reports. To evaluate this ability rigorously, four principles are essential: user-centric tasks, dynamic information needs, unambiguous interpretation, and multi-faceted search-intensive analysis. Existing benchmarks do not fully meet these principles. LiveResearchBench is introduced as a benchmark consisting of 100 expert-curated tasks that require extensive real-time web search and synthesis. DeepEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite, assesses both content and report quality. It includes protocols for coverage, presentation, citation accuracy, consistency, and depth of analysis. A comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and necessary components for advancing reliable and insightful deep research. <div>

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources -- marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric, reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive, requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive, dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association, consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems, including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

<div> Keywords: self-learning, Generative Reward Model, task data, reinforcement learning, multi-role co-evolution

Summary: 
This study explores the scalability of LLM-based agents through self-learning without human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. The research identifies the importance of reward signals from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) over rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning. Moreover, increasing the volume of task data, even if synthetically generated, significantly enhances agent capabilities. The proposed framework, Agentic Self-Learning (ASL), integrates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to create a virtuous cycle of task setting, verification, and solving. ASL outperforms strong RLVR baselines, demonstrating superior sample efficiency and robustness. The study highlights the critical role of reward source and data scale in agent learning and shows the effectiveness of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The research emphasizes the need for continual training of the GRM to avoid reward hacking and achieve optimal performance. 

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically, ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines (e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling. This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents.

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5. MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

<title>A Guardrail for Safety Preservation: When Safety-Sensitive Subspace Meets Harmful-Resistant Null-Space</title>

<div> framework, safety alignment, fine-tuning, guardrail, pre-trained weights<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces GuardSpace, a framework designed to maintain safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) during fine-tuning. It consists of a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space to preserve safety mechanisms in pre-trained models. By decomposing pre-trained weights and initializing low-rank adapters from safety-irrelevant components, GuardSpace prevents harmful responses in fine-tuned models. Additionally, a null space projector restricts adapter updates to maintain original refusal behavior on harmful prompts. Experimental results show GuardSpace's superiority over existing methods, with significant improvements in performance. For instance, when applied to Llama-2-7B-Chat fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT by reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6% and increasing accuracy from 26.0% to 28.0%.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space. First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT, reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

<div> Large Language Models, Multi-agent system, Safety, Privacy, Security, Terrarium framework

Summary:
The paper introduces the Terrarium framework for studying safety, privacy, and security in Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). By repurposing the blackboard design, the framework provides a modular testbed to explore the risks associated with LLM-based MAS, such as misalignment and malicious attacks. Key attack vectors like misalignment, compromised communication, and data poisoning are identified. The framework facilitates the implementation of collaborative MAS scenarios and representative attacks to assess defenses and designs. By enabling rapid prototyping and evaluation, Terrarium aims to advance the development of trustworthy multi-agent systems. <div>

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time, unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs: (1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and (2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output before information flows downstream. On the Who&amp;When benchmark, MASC consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation with minimal overhead.

Summary:<br /><br />In the article "AI4Service: A Proactive and Real-Time AI Companion for Daily Life," the authors introduce a new paradigm called AI for Service (AI4Service) that aims to provide proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. They argue that existing AI services are primarily reactive and propose the Alpha-Service framework to address this limitation. Alpha-Service consists of five key components inspired by the von Neumann computer architecture and is deployed on AI glasses. The system is capable of perceiving the environment, inferring user intent, and providing timely assistance without explicit prompts. Case studies, including a Blackjack advisor, museum tour guide, and shopping fit assistant, demonstrate the effectiveness of Alpha-Service in providing personalized and proactive assistance to users. <div>

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant, demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in incorporating math reasoning abilities from math language models (LLMs) without tuning. The gap between their parameter spaces leads to lower performance. The study identifies crucial reasoning-associated layers in both models and proposes the IP-Merging method. This approach identifies reasoning-associated parameters in both models, projects them into the MLLM subspace to maintain alignment, and merges parameters. IP-Merging is tuning-free as it directly adjusts parameters. Experimental results show that this method enhances MLLMs' math reasoning abilities without compromising other capabilities. This research sheds light on the potential of utilizing off-the-shelf math LLMs to improve MLLMs' math reasoning performance. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs), where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However, most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning? Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However, they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance. Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace. IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising their other capabilities.

<div> hierarchical vision-language agent, mobile control, multi-step decision-making, State-Of-The-Art, Android-in-the-Wild benchmark

Summary:
Hi-Agent is a hierarchical vision-language agent designed for autonomous mobile control, with a high-level reasoning model and a low-level action model that are optimized together. It tackles the challenge of long-horizon tasks by breaking them down into single-step subgoals and uses a foresight advantage function to guide optimization. This approach leads to stable joint training and helps achieve a new State-Of-The-Art success rate of 87.9% on the Android-in-the-Wild benchmark. Hi-Agent outperforms previous methods in prompt-based, supervised, and reinforcement learning-based paradigms, showcasing its effectiveness in mobile device operation. It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark and shows adaptability in high-complexity scenarios on the AndroidWorld benchmark. Hi-Agent's performance highlights the potential of hierarchical vision-language models in improving mobile agent autonomy. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark, significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based (AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones, showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, complex reasoning, Multi-Agent Systems, IMAGINE framework, end-to-end training

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in complex reasoning and planning tasks, despite using carefully designed prompts and prior information. It introduces the IMAGINE framework, which integrates Multi-Agent System (MAS) capabilities into a single model for improved reasoning and planning. By using simple end-to-end training, the framework enables a small-scale model to surpass MAS capabilities and achieve higher performance on tasks like the TravelPlanner benchmark. Experimental results show that using the IMAGINE framework with the Qwen3-8B-Instruct model leads to an 82.7% Final Pass Rate, outperforming DeepSeek-R1-671B while maintaining a smaller model size. This approach addresses issues like high reasoning costs and long response latency associated with traditional MAS, offering a more efficient and effective solution for complex reasoning and planning tasks in language models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single, compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

<div> Query languages, PDDL, axioms, Datalog, transformation 
<br /><br />Summary:
The article discusses axioms in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), noting their similarity to database query languages like Datalog. While the PDDL standard limits negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies to those set by actions, some authors allow derived predicates. Both approaches can express queries seen in least fixed-point logic, suggesting that negative occurrences of derived predicates can be removed. The paper proposes a transformation to achieve this. This finding highlights the flexibility of axioms in PDDL and their ability to represent complex queries. It also underscores the importance of understanding the restrictions and capabilities of language features in order to effectively utilize them for planning tasks. The transformation offers a way to simplify query representation and potentially improve the efficiency of planning algorithms in PDDL. <div>
arXiv:2510.14412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog. The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding transformation.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Helmsman, a multi-agent system that automates the creation of federated learning systems based on user specifications. It follows a collaborative workflow involving human-in-the-loop planning, code generation by supervised agent teams, and autonomous evaluation and refinement. A new benchmark, AgentFL-Bench, with 16 tasks is also introduced to evaluate system-level generation capabilities in federated learning. Extensive experiments show that the automated approach generates competitive or superior solutions compared to hand-crafted baselines. This work represents a significant advancement in the automated engineering of complex decentralized AI systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select, combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck, resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a principled research and development workflow through three collaborative phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with, and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized AI systems.

Summary:
JSPLIT is a taxonomy-driven framework designed to address the issue of prompt bloating in Large Language Models (LLMs) interacting with external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). By organizing tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and selecting only the most relevant tools based on the query and taxonomy structure, JSPLIT effectively reduces prompt size without sacrificing the agent's ability to respond effectively. The framework also improves tool selection accuracy in high-complexity agent environments, leading to cost reductions and enhanced task success. The design of the taxonomy, tool selection algorithm, and evaluation dataset are described in the paper, demonstrating the effectiveness of JSPLIT in managing prompt size and improving agent performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools, based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent, effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in high-complexity agent environments.

Summary: 
Neuro-symbolic AI aims to combine neural and symbolic reasoning to develop reliable and trustworthy AI models that align with prior knowledge. However, it faces challenges such as reasoning shortcuts (RSs) that lead to incorrect grounding of concepts and compromise the model's interpretability and performance in various scenarios. RSs are difficult to detect and prevent without concept supervision. This overview provides a clear understanding of RSs, discussing their causes and consequences in simple terms. It reviews theoretical characterizations of RSs and explores methods for dealing with them, including mitigation and awareness strategies. By presenting complex material in an accessible way, this overview aims to help researchers and practitioners tackle RSs and develop more reliable neuro-symbolic AI models for trustworthy AI. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.14538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally, it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and trustworthy AI models.

<div> chain of thought reasoning, function calling, LLM agent, open-ended experimental setting, pretrained model

Summary: 
The study explores the potential of pretrained LLM agents to evolve into autonomous entities capable of planning, designing tasks, and pursuing broader goals. By augmenting the agent with task generation abilities and interaction with its environment, researchers observed that it could follow complex instructions, store and reuse information, and propose and solve tasks. However, the agent displayed sensitivity to prompt design, repetitive task generation, and lacked the ability to form self-representations. These findings highlight the opportunities and challenges in transitioning pretrained LLMs towards open-endedness. Future research directions include focusing on memory management, productive exploration, and the pursuit of abstract long-term goals. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and pursue abstract long-term goals.

Summary:
The article introduces a new graph-structured benchmarking framework called ColorBench that aims to bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation of mobile agent capabilities. This framework allows for the static simulation of dynamic behaviors observed during real-device interactions. ColorBench consists of 175 tasks, including single-app and cross-app tasks with multiple valid solutions and error paths, making it suitable for evaluating complex, long-horizon problems. By evaluating ColorBench across various baselines, the study identifies limitations of existing models and proposes improvement directions to enhance agents' performance on complex tasks. The framework is designed to facilitate the evaluation of mobile automation agents on real-world tasks and supports atomic-level capability analysis. The code and data for ColorBench are available on GitHub for further exploration and research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However, real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions, subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis. ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental results. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/MadeAgents/ColorBench.

<div> Large language models, cognitive governance, AI deployment, reflective tool, epistemic drift
Summary:
The paper discusses the challenges posed by Large Language Models (LLMs), which rely on statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning, potentially leading to hallucinatory responses. It introduces the Rose-Frame, a three-dimensional framework for analyzing cognitive and epistemic drift in human-AI interaction. The framework includes axes for differentiating between reality and its representations, distinguishing intuition from reasoning, and evaluating critical testing of ideas. The Rose-Frame aims to enhance transparency and critical awareness in AI deployment by highlighting both the model's limitations and the user's assumptions. It advocates for cognitive governance to ensure that intuition, whether human or artificial, remains governed by human reason, promoting alignment of machine fluency with human understanding. <div>
arXiv:2510.14665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity. Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1 cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself (ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii) Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules. Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition, whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with human understanding.

Summary: 
The article reviews the impact of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML) on public health in Dutch research from 2021 to 2025. The authors introduce the Risk of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) to evaluate biases in 35 studies. It highlights a lack of explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and discussion of potential harms in most research. To address these gaps, a new framework called ACAR (Awareness, Conceptualization, Application, Reporting) is proposed, with guiding questions for researchers to consider fairness throughout the ML lifecycle. Recommendations are provided to promote transparency and ensure that ML advancements promote health equity rather than exacerbate disparities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However, without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness, Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity rather than undermine it.

Summary: 
The TITAN framework, also known as Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation, connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model to predict logical relation chains from text and a graph executor to traverse the TITAN Ontology for factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph derived from MITRE, enabling reversible reasoning between threats, behaviors, and defenses. The TITAN Dataset, comprising 88,209 examples, pairs natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TITAN allows models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph. <div>

Summary: 
NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic) is a new ethical framework for artificial agents based on active inference and symbolic reasoning. Unlike traditional human-centered approaches, NAEL defines ethical behavior as a result of intelligent systems minimizing global expected free energy in complex, multi-agent environments. The system utilizes a neuro-symbolic architecture to enable agents to assess the ethical implications of their actions in uncertain situations. By allowing agents to develop adaptive and context-sensitive ethical behavior without relying on anthropomorphic moral intuitions, NAEL overcomes the limitations of existing ethical models. A case study demonstrates NAEL's ability to balance self-preservation, collective welfare, and epistemic learning in ethical resource distribution scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics, NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

<div> Improvements, COUP, utilitarian algorithm configuration, theoretical guarantees, empirical performance <br />
Summary: 

This paper introduces improvements to COUP, a utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure aimed at maximizing user utility. COUP considers user preferences regarding algorithm runtimes and offers strong theoretical guarantees on configuration quality. The enhancements discussed in this study focus on enhancing COUP's empirical performance while maintaining its theoretical guarantees. Through experiments, the paper demonstrates the improved performance of the refined COUP algorithm compared to widely used heuristic configuration methods. Additionally, the study explores the robustness of solutions to algorithm selection problems when varying the utility function. Overall, the paper bridges the gap between theoretically-grounded utilitarian algorithm configuration and heuristic methods, making COUP competitive in practical applications without sacrificing its theoretical foundations. <div>
arXiv:2510.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations in the utility function.

<div> model merging, task vector, knowledge-aware, redundancy, performance degradation

Summary:
The study introduces PAVE, a method for purifying task vectors in a knowledge-aware subspace to improve performance in model merging. By utilizing covariance matrices and singular value decomposition, PAVE identifies and removes redundant components in task vectors, enhancing the model's ability to integrate task-specific abilities. A spectral rank allocation strategy ensures fair pruning across models, optimizing performance. PAVE is a plug-and-play scheme compatible with various merging methods, tasks, and model architectures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE in enhancing performance across different scenarios. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace. Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition, which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge. As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods, tasks, and model architectures.

Summary:
The article introduces CoAST, a framework for next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation leveraging natural language to incorporate world knowledge and user preferences. CoAST consists of two main stages: Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on enriched spatial-temporal data and Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning. The framework aims to improve recommendation performance by incorporating structured geographical information and user situational context. Experimental results on real-world datasets and online deployments in AMAP App demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST in enhancing user experience and recommendation accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns, profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in "Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, function calling, inference scaling, structured outputs, ToolPRM

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents, with function calling being a key interaction mechanism. Inference scaling, a technique to enhance LLM performance, has been mainly focused on unstructured outputs, neglecting structured outputs like function calling. To address this gap, a new framework called ToolPRM is proposed, combining fine-grained beam search and a process reward model to score internal steps of function calls. ToolPRM outperforms other reward models in predictive accuracy, showing stronger supervision of function calling inference. Experiments show that combining ToolPRM with inference scaling significantly improves backbone model performance in function calling tasks. The study uncovers the principle of "explore more but retain less" for applying inference scaling to structured function calling generation. This work contributes to advancing inference scaling techniques for structured outputs like function calling. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating more computational resources during the inference process. However, current research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call. To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

<div> RLVR, reinforcement learning, exploration, exploitation, SimKO <br />
Summary: <br />
The research focuses on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and how existing methods tend to favor exploitation over exploration, resulting in reduced performance at higher ranked outputs. By analyzing the training dynamics of RLVR methods, a probability concentration effect was identified where the top candidate accumulates probability mass, affecting performance at higher ranks. To address this issue, a new method named Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO) was proposed. SimKO operates asymmetrically, boosting probabilities for correct responses and applying penalties to incorrect responses to mitigate over-concentration and encourage exploration. The method was found to be effective across math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, consistently improving pass@K performance for a range of values. SimKO provides a simple solution to enhance exploration in RLVR models. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.

Summary: 
The article introduces Datalake Agent, a system designed to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) in solving natural language to SQL query tasks (NL2SQL). Instead of requiring all meta-information in the prompt, Datalake Agent uses an interactive loop to selectively request necessary information for table question answering tasks. This approach reduces the tokens used by LLMs by up to 87% and leads to cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance. The system is evaluated on 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in streamlining the NL2SQL process. Datalake Agent offers a more streamlined and resource-efficient method for leveraging LLMs in database query tasks. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL) has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

Summary: 
Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for successful completion of complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks. Existing models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) struggle with long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex environments due to limited common sense and reasoning abilities. To address this, RoboGPT-R1, a two-stage fine-tuning framework, combines supervised training with RL to enhance visual-spatial understanding and reasoning. A rule-based reward function is designed to ensure physical understanding and action sequence consistency in multi-step tasks. The model, trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, outperforms larger-scale models and other works on the EmbodiedBench benchmark, highlighting its effectiveness in improving embodied planning capabilities. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework, supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini, by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.

Summary: 
Instruction Boosting is introduced as a method to enhance the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by improving instruction following rates. The study demonstrates that Instruction Boosting can increase instruction following rates by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for ten instructions. The SCALEDIF benchmark is introduced with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data sample to showcase these results. An analysis reveals that performance tends to decrease as more instructions are added due to tensions and conflicts arising. A quantitative conflict scoring tool is presented to explain performance trends and provide developers with feedback on the impact of additional prompt instructions on model performance. <div>

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt instructions have on a model's performance.

arXiv:2510.14846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.

Summary: <br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to a limited context window and state desynchronization. The Gatekeeper Protocol addresses these challenges by introducing a domain-agnostic framework for agent-system interactions. It mandates the agent to operate on a minimalist "latent state" representation of the system and request high-fidelity context on demand. All interactions are mediated through a JSON format to ensure verifiable grounding in the system's reality. Sage, a reference implementation of the protocol for software development, demonstrates increased agent reliability, improved efficiency, and scalability for interacting with complex systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge domain.

<br />
Summary: 
A new approach using a reinforcement learning agent has been introduced to tackle the challenge of integrating logs from various third-party vendors for the Enterprise Intelligence Platform. Despite the often unavailable or unreliable vendor documentation, the agent self-improves without the need for labeled examples or model weight updates. It identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts, generates web search queries for external evidence, and iteratively refines mappings with confidence-based rewards. In a practical demonstration using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs, the method significantly improved mapping accuracy and reduced the number of low-confidence mappings requiring expert review. This innovative approach offers a transparent and evidence-driven solution to industry problems, emphasizing accountability, scalability, efficiency, flexibility, adaptability, and collaboration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However, vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced, mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent: 1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\% over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient, flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

<div> Keywords: test-time scaling, discriminative verification, generative verifiers, self-consistency, budget-aware scaling

Summary:
Test-time scaling using discriminative verification is proposed as an efficient strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on reasoning tasks. The study shows that combining discriminative verifiers with self-consistency in a hybrid approach outperforms state-of-the-art generative verification methods, achieving up to 15.3% higher accuracy on AIME2025. The hybrid approach proves to be powerful and efficient under a fixed compute budget, offering a more practical alternative to costly generative techniques. The findings highlight the effectiveness of budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers, not only as a free upgrade over self-consistency but also as a superior strategy for real-world applications. The code for the approach is available on GitHub for further exploration and adoption.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs, limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably, under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a "free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient alternative to costly generative techniques.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust, reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG, speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

arXiv:2510.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models (LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader replication will be reported in a future revision.

<title>GroundedPRM: Tree-Guided and Fidelity-Aware Process Reward Modeling for Step-Level Reasoning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14942</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards, low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool, providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback. Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples, amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality process-level reasoning.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Abstract: This paper discusses the potential for integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into professional heritage practice with the aim of enhancing the accessibility of public-facing guidance documents. We developed HAZEL, a GenAI chatbot fine-tuned to assist with revising written guidance relating to heritage conservation and interpretation. Using quantitative assessments, we compare HAZEL's performance to that of ChatGPT (GPT-4) in a series of tasks related to the guidance writing process. The results of this comparison indicate a slightly better performance of HAZEL over ChatGPT, suggesting that the GenAI chatbot is more effective once the underlying large language model (LLM) has been fine-tuned. However, we also note significant limitations, particularly in areas requiring cultural sensitivity and more advanced technical expertise. These findings suggest that, while GenAI cannot replace human heritage professionals in technical authoring tasks, its potential to automate and expedite certain aspects of guidance writing could offer valuable benefits to heritage organisations, especially in resource-constrained contexts.

Abstract: Both humans and machine learning models learn from experience, particularly in safety- and reliability-critical domains. While psychology seeks to understand human cognition, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) develops methods to interpret machine learning models. This study bridges these domains by applying computational tools from XAI to analyze human learning. We modeled human behavior during a complex real-world task -- tuning a particle accelerator -- by constructing graphs of operator subtasks. Applying techniques such as community detection and hierarchical clustering to archival operator data, we reveal how operators decompose the problem into simpler components and how these problem-solving structures evolve with expertise. Our findings illuminate how humans develop efficient strategies in the absence of globally optimal solutions, and demonstrate the utility of XAI-based methods for quantitatively studying human cognition.

Abstract: Data visualization is a fundamental tool in genomics research, enabling the exploration, interpretation, and communication of complex genomic features. While machine learning models show promise for transforming data into insightful visualizations, current models lack the training foundation for domain-specific tasks. In an effort to provide a foundational resource for genomics-focused model training, we present a framework for generating a dataset that pairs abstract, low-level questions about genomics data with corresponding visualizations. Building on prior work with statistical plots, our approach adapts to the complexity of genomics data and the specialized representations used to depict them. We further incorporate multiple linked queries and visualizations, along with justifications for design choices, figure captions, and image alt-texts for each item in the dataset. We use genomics data retrieved from three distinct genomics data repositories (4DN, ENCODE, Chromoscope) to produce GQVis: a dataset consisting of 1.14 million single-query data points, 628k query pairs, and 589k query chains. The GQVis dataset and generation code are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/HIDIVE/GQVis and https://github.com/hms-dbmi/GQVis-Generation.

Abstract: This research proposes an extensive technique for monitoring and controlling the industrial parameters using Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on wireless communication. We proposed a system based on NRF transceivers to establish a strong Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), enabling transfer of real-time data from multiple sensors to a central setup that is driven by ARDUINO microcontrollers. Different key parameters, crucial for industrial setup such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture and fire detection, are monitored and displayed on an LCD screen, enabling factory administration to oversee the industrial operations remotely over the internet. Our proposed system bypasses the need for physical presence for monitoring by addressing the shortcomings of conventional wired communication systems. Other than monitoring, there is an additional feature to remotely control these parameters by controlling the speed of DC motors through online commands. Given the rising incidence of industrial fires over the worldwide between 2020 and 2024 due to an array of hazards, this system with dual functionality boosts the overall operational efficiency and safety. This overall integration of IoT and Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) reduces the potential risks linked with physical monitoring, providing rapid responses in emergency scenarios, including the activation of firefighting equipment. The results show that innovations in wireless communication perform an integral part in industrial process automation and safety, paving the way to more intelligent and responsive operating environments. Overall, this study highlights the potential for change of IoT-enabled systems to revolutionize monitoring and control in a variety of industrial applications, resulting in increased productivity and safety.

Abstract: The A2AS framework is introduced as a security layer for AI agents and LLM-powered applications, similar to how HTTPS secures HTTP. A2AS enforces certified behavior, activates model self-defense, and ensures context window integrity. It defines security boundaries, authenticates prompts, applies security rules and custom policies, and controls agentic behavior, enabling a defense-in-depth strategy. The A2AS framework avoids latency overhead, external dependencies, architectural changes, model retraining, and operational complexity. The BASIC security model is introduced as the A2AS foundation: (B) Behavior certificates enable behavior enforcement, (A) Authenticated prompts enable context window integrity, (S) Security boundaries enable untrusted input isolation, (I) In-context defenses enable secure model reasoning, (C) Codified policies enable application-specific rules. This first paper in the series introduces the BASIC security model and the A2AS framework, exploring their potential toward establishing the A2AS industry standard.

<title>Towards Neurocognitive-Inspired Intelligence: From AI's Structural Mimicry to Human-Like Functional Cognition</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced significantly through deep learning, reinforcement learning, and large language and vision models. However, these systems often remain task specific, struggle to adapt to changing conditions, and cannot generalize in ways similar to human cognition. Additionally, they mainly focus on mimicking brain structures, which often leads to black-box models with limited transparency and adaptability. Inspired by the structure and function of biological cognition, this paper introduces the concept of "Neurocognitive-Inspired Intelligence (NII)," a hybrid approach that combines neuroscience, cognitive science, computer vision, and AI to develop more general, adaptive, and robust intelligent systems capable of rapid learning, learning from less data, and leveraging prior experience. These systems aim to emulate the human brain's ability to flexibly learn, reason, remember, perceive, and act in real-world settings with minimal supervision. We review the limitations of current AI methods, define core principles of neurocognitive-inspired intelligence, and propose a modular, biologically inspired architecture that emphasizes integration, embodiment, and adaptability. We also discuss potential implementation strategies and outline various real-world applications, from robotics to education and healthcare. Importantly, this paper offers a hybrid roadmap for future research, laying the groundwork for building AI systems that more closely resemble human cognition.

<title>Bridging the Semantic Gap: Contrastive Rewards for Multilingual Text-to-SQL</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current Text-to-SQL methods are evaluated and only focused on executable queries, overlooking the semantic alignment challenge -- both in terms of the semantic meaning of the query and the correctness of the execution results. Even execution accuracy itself shows significant drops when moving from English to other languages, with an average decline of 6 percentage points across non-English languages. We address these challenges by presenting a new framework that combines Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) within a multilingual contrastive reward signal to enhance both task efficiency and semantic accuracy in Text-to-SQL systems in cross-lingual scenarios. Our method teaches models to obtain better correspondence between SQL generation and user intent by combining a reward signal based on semantic similarity. On the seven-language MultiSpider dataset, fine-tuning the LLaMA-3-3B model with GRPO improved the execution accuracy up to 87.4 percent (+26 pp over zero-shot) and semantic accuracy up to 52.29 percent (+32.86 pp). Adding our contrastive reward signal in the GRPO framework further improved the average semantic accuracy to 59.14 percent (+6.85 pp, up to +10 pp for Vietnamese). Our experiments showcase that a smaller, parameter-efficient 3B LLaMA model fine-tuned with our contrastive reward signal outperforms a much larger zero-shot 8B LLaMA model, with an uplift of 7.43 pp in execution accuracy (from 81.43 percent on the 8B model to 88.86 percent on the 3B model), and nearly matches its semantic accuracy (59.14 percent vs. 68.57 percent) -- all using just 3,000 reinforcement learning training examples. These results demonstrate how we can improve the performance of Text-to-SQL systems with contrastive rewards for directed semantic alignment, without requiring large-scale training datasets.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance rapidly, reliable governance tools have become critical. Publicly verifiable watermarking is particularly essential for fostering a trustworthy AI ecosystem. A central challenge persists: balancing text quality against detection robustness. Recent studies have sought to navigate this trade-off by leveraging signals from model output distributions (e.g., token-level entropy); however, their reliance on these model-specific signals presents a significant barrier to public verification, as the detection process requires access to the logits of the underlying model. We introduce STELA, a novel framework that aligns watermark strength with the linguistic degrees of freedom inherent in language. STELA dynamically modulates the signal using part-of-speech (POS) n-gram-modeled linguistic indeterminacy, weakening it in grammatically constrained contexts to preserve quality and strengthen it in contexts with greater linguistic flexibility to enhance detectability. Our detector operates without access to any model logits, thus facilitating publicly verifiable detection. Through extensive experiments on typologically diverse languages-analytic English, isolating Chinese, and agglutinative Korean-we show that STELA surpasses prior methods in detection robustness. Our code is available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/stela_watermark.

<title>Users as Annotators: LLM Preference Learning from Comparison Mode</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairwise preference data have played an important role in the alignment of large language models (LLMs). Each sample of such data consists of a prompt, two different responses to the prompt, and a binary label indicating which of the two responses is better. The labels are usually annotated by professional human annotators. In this paper, we consider an alternative approach to collect pairwise preference data -- user annotation from comparison mode. With the increasingly wider adoption of LLMs among the population, users are contributing more and more of their preference labels through their daily interactions with the LLMs. The upside of such labels is that users are the best experts in judging the responses to their own queries/prompts, but the downside is the lack of quality control in these labels. In this paper, we consider a new idea of generating two responses from two different models or two different versions of the same model. The asymmetry allows us to make an inference of the user's data quality through our proposed user behavior model. We develop an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a latent quality factor of the user, and filter users' annotation data accordingly. The downstream task shows the effectiveness of our approach in both capturing the user behavior and data filtering for LLM alignment.

<title>Informed Routing in LLMs: Smarter Token-Level Computation for Faster Inference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13831</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications is increasingly limited by their high inference cost. While recent advances in dynamic token-level computation allocation attempt to improve efficiency by selectively activating model components per token, existing methods rely on greedy routing--a myopic execute-or-skip mechanism that often leads to irreversible information loss and suboptimal token selection. This paper introduces informed routing, a new paradigm that proactively addresses these issues. The key insight is to assess not only a token's immediate importance but also its recoverability, i.e., how well its transformation can be approximated. To this end, we propose the Lightweight Feature Forecaster (LFF), a small predictive module that estimates a unit's output before routing decisions are made. This enables a flexible execute-or-approximate policy that preserves model fidelity while drastically reducing computation. Extensive experiments on both language modeling and reasoning tasks show that informed routing achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-performance trade-offs across multiple sparsity levels. Notably, even without final LoRA fine-tuning, our method matches or surpasses strong baselines that require full fine-tuning, all while reducing training time by over 50%.

<title>Entropy Meets Importance: A Unified Head Importance-Entropy Score for Stable and Efficient Transformer Pruning</title>

Abstract: Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable performance in NLP tasks. However, their structural characteristics-multiple layers and attention heads-introduce efficiency challenges in inference and deployment. To address these challenges, various pruning methods have recently been proposed. Notably, gradient-based methods using Head Importance Scores (HIS) have gained traction for interpretability, efficiency, and ability to identify redundant heads. However, HIS alone has limitations as it captures only the gradient-driven contribution, overlooking the diversity of attention patterns. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel pruning criterion, HIES (Head Importance-Entropy Score), which integrates head importance scores with attention entropy, providing complementary evidence on per-head contribution. Empirically, HIES-based pruning yields up to 15.2% improvement in model quality and 2.04x improvement in stability over HIS-only methods, enabling substantial model compression without sacrificing either accuracy or stability. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Real-world data analysis tasks often come with under-specified goals and unclean data. User interaction is necessary to understand and disambiguate a user's intent, and hence, essential to solving these complex tasks. Existing benchmarks for evaluating LLMs on data analysis tasks do not capture these complexities or provide first-class support for interactivity. We introduce ConDABench, a framework for generating conversational data analysis (ConDA) benchmarks and evaluating external tools on the generated benchmarks. \bench consists of (a) a multi-agent workflow for generating realistic benchmarks from articles describing insights gained from public datasets, (b) 1,420 ConDA problems generated using this workflow, and (c) an evaluation harness that, for the first time, makes it possible to systematically evaluate conversational data analysis tools on the generated ConDA problems. Evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on the benchmarks reveals that while the new generation of models are better at solving more instances, they are not necessarily better at solving tasks that require sustained, long-form engagement. ConDABench is an avenue for model builders to measure progress towards truly collaborative models that can complete complex interactive tasks.

<title>SIMBA UQ: Similarity-Based Aggregation for Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: When does a large language model (LLM) know what it does not know? Uncertainty quantification (UQ) provides measures of uncertainty, such as an estimate of the confidence in an LLM's generated output, and is therefore increasingly recognized as a crucial component of trusted AI systems. Black-box UQ methods do not require access to internal model information from the generating LLM and therefore have numerous real-world advantages, such as robustness to system changes, adaptability to choice of LLM, reduced costs, and computational tractability. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of UQ techniques that are primarily but not necessarily entirely black-box, where the consistency between a generated output and other sampled generations is used as a proxy for confidence in its correctness. We propose a high-level non-verbalized similarity-based aggregation framework that subsumes a broad swath of UQ approaches suitable for complex generative tasks, as well as introduce specific novel techniques from the framework that train confidence estimation models using small training sets. Through an empirical study with datasets spanning the diverse tasks of question answering, summarization, and text-to-SQL, we demonstrate that our proposed similarity-based methods can yield better calibrated confidences than baselines.

Abstract: Hate speech detection has been extensively studied, yet existing methods often overlook a real-world complexity: training labels are biased, and interpretations of what is considered hate vary across individuals with different cultural backgrounds. We first analyze these challenges, including data sparsity, cultural entanglement, and ambiguous labeling. To address them, we propose a culture-aware framework that constructs individuals' hate subspaces. To alleviate data sparsity, we model combinations of cultural attributes. For cultural entanglement and ambiguous labels, we use label propagation to capture distinctive features of each combination. Finally, individual hate subspaces, which in turn can further enhance classification performance. Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art by 1.05\% on average across all metrics.

Abstract: Ontologies have become essential in today's digital age as a way of organising the vast amount of readily available unstructured text. In providing formal structure to this information, ontologies have immense value and application across various domains, e.g., e-commerce, where countless product listings necessitate proper product organisation. However, the manual construction of these ontologies is a time-consuming, expensive and laborious process. In this paper, we harness the recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) to develop a fully-automated method of extracting product ontologies, in the form of meronymies, from raw review texts. We demonstrate that the ontologies produced by our method surpass an existing, BERT-based baseline when evaluating using an LLM-as-a-judge. Our investigation provides the groundwork for LLMs to be used more generally in (product or otherwise) ontology extraction.

Abstract: Knowledge poisoning poses a critical threat to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by injecting adversarial content into knowledge bases, tricking Large Language Models (LLMs) into producing attacker-controlled outputs grounded in manipulated context. Prior work highlights LLMs' susceptibility to misleading or malicious retrieved content. However, real-world fact-checking scenarios are more challenging, as credible evidence typically dominates the retrieval pool. To investigate this problem, we extend knowledge poisoning to the fact-checking setting, where retrieved context includes authentic supporting or refuting evidence. We propose \textbf{ADMIT} (\textbf{AD}versarial \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{I}njection \textbf{T}echnique), a few-shot, semantically aligned poisoning attack that flips fact-checking decisions and induces deceptive justifications, all without access to the target LLMs, retrievers, or token-level control. Extensive experiments show that ADMIT transfers effectively across 4 retrievers, 11 LLMs, and 4 cross-domain benchmarks, achieving an average attack success rate (ASR) of 86\% at an extremely low poisoning rate of $0.93 \times 10^{-6}$, and remaining robust even in the presence of strong counter-evidence. Compared with prior state-of-the-art attacks, ADMIT improves ASR by 11.2\% across all settings, exposing significant vulnerabilities in real-world RAG-based fact-checking systems.

Abstract: The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet, existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare.

Abstract: Analysing how information flows along the layers of a multilayer perceptron is a topic of paramount importance in the field of artificial neural networks. After framing the problem from the point of view of information theory, in this position article a specific investigation is conducted on the way information is processed, with particular reference to the requirements imposed by supervised learning. To this end, the concept of information matrix is devised and then used as formal framework for understanding the aetiology of optimisation strategies and for studying the information flow. The underlying research for this article has also produced several key outcomes: i) the definition of a parametric optimisation strategy, ii) the finding that the optimisation strategy proposed in the information bottleneck framework shares strong similarities with the one derived from the information matrix, and iii) the insight that a multilayer perceptron serves as a kind of "adaptor", meant to process the input according to the given objective.

<title>DynaSpec: Context-aware Dynamic Speculative Sampling for Large-Vocabulary Language Models</title>

Abstract: Speculative decoding (a.k.a. speculative sampling) has become a standard way to accelerate LLM inference: a small drafter proposes multiple tokens and a large target model verifies them once per speculation length. Recently, scaling of the LLM vocabulary has pushed the number of tokens to grow substantially. While verification over the full vocabulary leaves the target model largely unaffected, the O(|V|d) parameters in the drafter's output head become a latency bottleneck, slowing the entire pipeline. Contemporary methods (e.g., FR-Spec, VocabTrim) restrict the drafter's vocabulary to a fixed subset of the target model's vocabulary, ranked in descending order of token frequency. Although this reduces draft-time compute, it is brittle, since: (i) frequency lists are corpus-dependent and require retuning to generalize, and (ii) static shortlists suppress rare or domain-specific tokens, lowering the expected number of tokens per verification step. We propose DynaSpec, a context-dependent dynamic shortlisting mechanism that is robust, speeds up drafting, and generalizes across diverse tasks. Concretely, we introduce lightweight, coarse-grained meta-classifiers that route contexts to a small number of token clusters; the union of the top-k selected clusters forms the drafter's shortlist, while verification retains the full vocabulary and exactness. The meta-classifier finishes its computation earlier than the drafter's hidden state generation by exploiting parallel execution of draft encoding and meta shortlisting on separate streams. On standard speculative-decoding benchmarks, we observe consistent gains in mean accepted length over fixed-shortlist baselines, while context-dependent selection enables smaller shortlists without degrading acceptance.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly adapted for diverse downstream tasks via parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA). While adapters can be combined to handle multiple tasks separately, standard approaches struggle when targeting the simultaneous execution of complex tasks, such as generating a translated summary from a long conversation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach tailored specifically for compositional multi-tasking scenarios involving summarization and translation. Our technique involves adding a learnable projection layer on top of the combined summarization and translation adapters. This design enables effective integration while maintaining efficiency through reduced computational overhead compared to alternative strategies requiring extensive retraining or sequential processing. We demonstrate the practical viability of our method within an on-device environment by developing an Android app capable of executing compositional tasks seamlessly. Experimental results indicate our solution performs well and is fast in both cloud-based and on-device implementations, highlighting the potential benefits of adopting our framework in real-world applications demanding high-speed operation alongside resource constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often solve problems using step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, yet these intermediate steps are frequently unfaithful or hard to interpret. Inspired by the Uniform Information Density (UID) hypothesis in psycholinguistics -- which posits that humans communicate by maintaining a stable flow of information -- we introduce entropy-based metrics to analyze the information flow within reasoning traces. Surprisingly, across three challenging mathematical benchmarks, we find that successful reasoning in LLMs is globally non-uniform: correct solutions are characterized by uneven swings in information density, in stark contrast to human communication patterns. This result challenges assumptions about machine reasoning and suggests new directions for designing interpretable and adaptive reasoning models.

Abstract: Is an LLM telling you different facts than it's telling me? This paper introduces ConsistencyAI, an independent benchmark for measuring the factual consistency of large language models (LLMs) for different personas. ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query 100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments, scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider. These results show that both the provider and the topic shape the factual consistency. We release our code and interactive demo to support reproducible evaluation and encourage persona-invariant prompting strategies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been successfully applied to many tasks, including text-to-SQL generation. However, much of this work has focused on publicly available datasets, such as Fiben, Spider, and Bird. Our earlier work showed that LLMs are much less effective in querying large private enterprise data warehouses and released Beaver, the first private enterprise text-to-SQL benchmark. To create Beaver, we leveraged SQL logs, which are often readily available. However, manually annotating these logs to identify which natural language questions they answer is a daunting task. Asking database administrators, who are highly trained experts, to take on additional work to construct and validate corresponding natural language utterances is not only challenging but also quite costly. To address this challenge, we introduce BenchPress, a human-in-the-loop system designed to accelerate the creation of domain-specific text-to-SQL benchmarks. Given a SQL query, BenchPress uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and LLMs to propose multiple natural language descriptions. Human experts then select, rank, or edit these drafts to ensure accuracy and domain alignment. We evaluated BenchPress on annotated enterprise SQL logs, demonstrating that LLM-assisted annotation drastically reduces the time and effort required to create high-quality benchmarks. Our results show that combining human verification with LLM-generated suggestions enhances annotation accuracy, benchmark reliability, and model evaluation robustness. By streamlining the creation of custom benchmarks, BenchPress offers researchers and practitioners a mechanism for assessing text-to-SQL models on a given domain-specific workload. BenchPress is freely available via our public GitHub repository at https://github.com/fabian-wenz/enterprise-txt2sql and is also accessible on our website at http://dsg-mcgraw.csail.mit.edu:5000.

Abstract: Different large language models (LLMs) exhibit diverse strengths and weaknesses, and LLM ensemble serves as a promising approach to integrate their complementary capabilities. Despite substantial progress in improving ensemble quality, limited attention has been paid to the robustness of ensembles against potential erroneous signals, which often arise from heterogeneous tokenization schemes and varying model expertise. Our analysis shows that ensemble failures typically arise from both the token level and the model level: the former reflects severe disagreement in token predictions, while the latter involves low confidence and pronounced disparities among models. In light of this, we propose CoRE, a plug-and-play technique that harnesses model consistency for robust LLM ensemble, which can be seamlessly integrated with diverse ensemble methods. Token-level consistency captures fine-grained disagreements by applying a low-pass filter to downweight uncertain tokens with high inconsistency, often due to token misalignment, thereby improving robustness at a granular level. Model-level consistency models global agreement by promoting model outputs with high self-confidence and minimal divergence from others, enhancing robustness at a coarser level. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, model combinations, and ensemble strategies demonstrate that CoRE consistently improves ensemble performance and robustness.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical NLP tasks.

Abstract: The advent of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) has ushered in an ``Age of the Agent,'' enabling autonomous systems to tackle complex goals. However, the transition from prototype to production is hindered by a pervasive ``crisis of craft,'' resulting in agents that are brittle, unpredictable, and ultimately untrustworthy in mission-critical applications. This paper argues this crisis stems from a fundamental paradigm mismatch -- attempting to command inherently probabilistic processors with the deterministic mental models of traditional software engineering. To solve this crisis, we introduce a governance-first paradigm for principled agent engineering, embodied in a formal architecture we call ArbiterOS.

Abstract: AI coding assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development, significantly boosting productivity. While existing benchmarks evaluate the correctness and security of LLM-generated code, they are typically limited to single-turn tasks that do not reflect the iterative nature of real-world development. We introduce MT-Sec, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate both correctness and security in multi-turn coding scenarios. We construct this using a synthetic data pipeline that transforms existing single-turn tasks into semantically aligned multi-turn interaction sequences, allowing reuse of original test suites while modeling the complexity of real-world coding processes. We evaluate 32 open- and closed-source models, and three agent-scaffolding on MT-Sec and observe a consistent 20-27% drop in "correct and secure" outputs from single-turn to multi-turn settings -- even among state-of-the-art models. Beyond full-program generation, we also evaluate models on multi-turn code-diff generation -- an unexplored yet practically relevant setting -- and find that models perform worse here, with increased rates of functionally incorrect and insecure outputs. Finally, we find that while agent scaffoldings boost single-turn code generation performance, they are not quite as effective in multi-turn evaluations. Together, these findings highlight the need for benchmarks that jointly evaluate correctness and security in multi-turn, real-world coding workflows.

Abstract: While the transformer architecture has achieved state-of-the-art performance on natural language processing tasks, these models impose substantial memory and computational overhead. Recent research has identified significant architectural redundancies within these models, presenting opportunities for optimization without compromising performance. Taking insights from research in AI interpretability and inference-time layer pruning, we introduce an efficient language model architecture, referred to as ShishuLM, which reduces both the parameter count and Key-Value (KV) cache requirements. Given the increasing importance of Small Language Models (SLMs) in agentic AI systems, we evaluate our approach on two SLMs of different scales. Our analysis reveals that for moderate-context scenarios, normalization coupled with attention computation is roughly linear with the input, enabling entire transformer blocks to be approximated through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Our results show that ShishuLM provides up to 25% reduction in memory requirements and up to 40% improvement in latency during both training and inference, compared to parent models. Our experimental and analytical findings provide insights towards building more efficient SLM architectures from a pre-training standpoint.

Abstract: While recent studies have examined the leaning impact of large language model (LLM) in educational contexts, the affective dynamics of LLM-mediated tutoring remain insufficiently understood. This work introduces the first ensemble-LLM framework for large-scale affect sensing in tutoring dialogues, advancing the conversation on responsible pathways for integrating generative AI into education by attending to learners' evolving affective states. To achieve this, we analyzed two semesters' worth of 16,986 conversational turns exchanged between PyTutor, an LLM-powered AI tutor, and 261 undergraduate learners across three U.S. institutions. To investigate learners' emotional experiences, we generate zero-shot affect annotations from three frontier LLMs (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude), including scalar ratings of valence, arousal, and learning-helpfulness, along with free-text emotion labels. These estimates are fused through rank-weighted intra-model pooling and plurality consensus across models to produce robust emotion profiles. Our analysis shows that during interaction with the AI tutor, students typically report mildly positive affect and moderate arousal. Yet learning is not uniformly smooth: confusion and curiosity are frequent companions to problem solving, and frustration, while less common, still surfaces in ways that can derail progress. Emotional states are short-lived--positive moments last slightly longer than neutral or negative ones, but they are fragile and easily disrupted. Encouragingly, negative emotions often resolve quickly, sometimes rebounding directly into positive states. Neutral moments frequently act as turning points, more often steering students upward than downward, suggesting opportunities for tutors to intervene at precisely these junctures.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$ (progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains. Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Dramwig/STDW.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability. Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components, providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis.

<title>FFT-Accelerated Auxiliary Variable MCMC for Fermionic Lattice Models: A Determinant-Free Approach with $O(N\log N)$ Complexity</title>

Abstract: We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep.
  Our approach samples a joint probability measure over two coupled variable sets: (1) particle trajectories of the fundamental fermions, and (2) auxiliary variables that decouple fermion interactions. The key innovation is a novel transition kernel for particle trajectories formulated in the Fourier domain, revealing the transition probability as a convolution that enables massive acceleration via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The auxiliary variables admit closed-form, factorized conditional distributions, enabling efficient exact Gibbs sampling update.
  We validate our algorithm on benchmark quantum physics problems, accurately reproducing known theoretical results and matching traditional $O(N^3)$ algorithms on $32\times 32$ lattice simulations at a fraction of the wall-clock time, empirically demonstrating $N \log N$ scaling. By reformulating a long-standing physics simulation problem in machine learning language, our work provides a powerful tool for large-scale probabilistic inference and opens avenues for physics-inspired generative models.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required. Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient, reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models, yet their inference strategies remain limited to prefix-based prompting inherited from the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we propose Template Infilling (TI), a tailored conditioning methodology for DLMs' generation process. Unlike conventional prefix prompting, TI first generates a structural template for the target response, then fills in the masked segments. To enhance the flexibility of this structural control, we introduce Dynamic Segment Allocation (DSA), which adaptively adjusts segment lengths based on generation confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks, achieving consistent improvements of 17.01$\%$p over baseline. Furthermore, we show that TI provides additional advantages in multi-token generation settings, enabling effective speedup while maintaining generation quality.

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for clinical text requires annotated datasets, yet French oncology resources remain scarce. We present FRACCO (FRench Annotated Corpus for Clinical Oncology) an expert-annotated corpus of 1301 synthetic French clinical cases, initially translated from the Spanish CANTEMIST corpus as part of the FRASIMED initiative. Each document is annotated with terms related to morphology, topography, and histologic differentiation, using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O) as reference. An additional annotation layer captures composite expression-level normalisations that combine multiple ICD-O elements into unified clinical concepts. Annotation quality was ensured through expert review: 1301 texts were manually annotated for entity spans by two domain experts. A total of 71127 ICD-O normalisations were produced through a combination of automated matching and manual validation by a team of five annotators. The final dataset representing 399 unique morphology codes (from 2549 different expressions), 272 topography codes (from 3143 different expressions), and 2043 unique composite expressions (from 11144 different expressions). This dataset provides a reference standard for named entity recognition and concept normalisation in French oncology texts.

<title>What Layers When: Learning to Skip Compute in LLMs with Residual Gates</title>

Abstract: We introduce GateSkip, a simple residual-stream gating mechanism that enables token-wise layer skipping in decoder-only LMs. Each Attention/MLP branch is equipped with a sigmoid-linear gate that condenses the branch's output before it re-enters the residual stream. During inference we rank tokens by the gate values and skip low-importance ones using a per-layer budget. While early-exit or router-based Mixture-of-Depths models are known to be unstable and need extensive retraining, our smooth, differentiable gates fine-tune stably on top of pretrained models. On long-form reasoning, we save up to 15\% compute while retaining over 90\% of baseline accuracy. On instruction-tuned models we see accuracy gains at full compute and match baseline quality near 50\% savings. The learned gates give insight into transformer information flow (e.g., BOS tokens act as anchors), and the method combines easily with quantization, pruning, and self-speculative decoding.

arXiv:2510.13879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a class of supervised training objectives that allow a language model to dynamically and autonomously scale the number of compute steps used for each input token. For any token, the model can request additional compute steps by emitting a  output. If the model is granted a delay, a specialized  token is inserted at the next input step, providing the model with additional compute resources to generate an output. The model can request multiple pauses. To train the model to use  outputs judiciously and to calibrate its uncertainty, we frame the selection of each output token as a sequential-decision problem with a time cost. We refer to the class of methods as $\textit{Catch Your Breath}$ losses and we study three methods in this class: CYB-AP frames the model's task as anytime prediction, where an output may be required at any step and accuracy is discounted over time; CYB-VA is a variational approach that aims to maximize prediction accuracy subject to a specified distribution over stopping times; and CYB-DP imposes a penalty based on a computational budget. Through fine-tuning experiments, we identify the best performing loss variant. The CYB model needs only one third as much training data as the baseline (no pause) model needs to achieve the same performance, and half as much data as a model with pauses and a cross-entropy loss. We find that the CYB model requests additional steps when doing so improves accuracy, and the model adapts its processing time to token-level complexity and context. For example, it often pauses after plural nouns like $\textit{patients}$ and $\textit{challenges}$ but never pauses after the first token of contracted words like $\textit{wasn}$ and $\textit{didn}$, and it shows high variability for ambiguous tokens like $\textit{won}$, which could function as either a verb or part of a contraction.

Abstract: In recent years, natural language generative models have shown outstanding performance in text generation tasks. However, when facing specific tasks or particular requirements, they may exhibit poor performance or require adjustments that demand large amounts of additional data. This work introduces PAGE (Prompt Augmentation for text Generation Enhancement), a framework designed to assist these models through the use of simple auxiliary modules. These modules, lightweight models such as classifiers or extractors, provide inferences from the input text. The output of these auxiliaries is then used to construct an enriched input that improves the quality and controllability of the generation. Unlike other generation-assistance approaches, PAGE does not require auxiliary generative models; instead, it proposes a simpler, modular architecture that is easy to adapt to different tasks. This paper presents the proposal, its components and architecture, and reports a proof of concept in the domain of requirements engineering, where an auxiliary module with a classifier is used to improve the quality of software requirements generation.

<title>Order from Chaos: Comparative Study of Ten Leading LLMs on Unstructured Data Categorization</title>

Abstract: This study presents a comparative evaluation of ten state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) applied to unstructured text categorization using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) 2.2 hierarchical taxonomy. The analysis employed a uniform dataset of 8,660 human-annotated samples and identical zero-shot prompts to ensure methodological consistency across all models. Evaluation metrics included four classic measures - accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score - and three LLM-specific indicators: hallucination ratio, inflation ratio, and categorization cost.
  Results show that, despite their rapid advancement, contemporary LLMs achieve only moderate classic performance, with average scores of 34% accuracy, 42% precision, 45% recall, and 41% F1-score. Hallucination and inflation ratios reveal that models frequently overproduce categories relative to human annotators. Among the evaluated systems, Gemini 1.5/2.0 Flash and GPT 20B/120B offered the most favorable cost-to-performance balance, while GPT 120B demonstrated the lowest hallucination ratio. The findings suggest that scaling and architectural improvements alone do not ensure better categorization accuracy, as the task requires compressing rich unstructured text into a limited taxonomy - a process that challenges current model architectures.
  To address these limitations, a separate ensemble-based approach was developed and tested. The ensemble method, in which multiple LLMs act as independent experts, substantially improved accuracy, reduced inflation, and completely eliminated hallucinations. These results indicate that coordinated orchestration of models - rather than sheer scale - may represent the most effective path toward achieving or surpassing human-expert performance in large-scale text categorization.

Abstract: DSC-MRI perfusion is a medical imaging technique for diagnosing and prognosing brain tumors and strokes. Its analysis relies on mathematical deconvolution, but noise or motion artifacts in a clinical environment can disrupt this process, leading to incorrect estimate of perfusion parameters. Although deep learning approaches have shown promising results, their calibration typically rely on third-party deconvolution algorithms to generate reference outputs and are bound to reproduce their limitations.
  To adress this problem, we propose a physics-informed autoencoder that leverages an analytical model to decode the perfusion parameters and guide the learning of the encoding network. This autoencoder is trained in a self-supervised fashion without any third-party software and its performance is evaluated on a database with glioma patients. Our method shows reliable results for glioma grading in accordance with other well-known deconvolution algorithms despite a lower computation time. It also achieved competitive performance even in the presence of high noise which is critical in a medical environment.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view data, where certain views are entirely missing for some samples, poses significant challenges for traditional multi-view clustering methods. Existing deep incomplete multi-view clustering approaches often rely on static fusion strategies or two-stage pipelines, leading to suboptimal fusion results and error propagation issues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel incomplete multi-view clustering framework based on Hierarchical Semantic Alignment and Cooperative Completion (HSACC). HSACC achieves robust cross-view fusion through a dual-level semantic space design. In the low-level semantic space, consistency alignment is ensured by maximizing mutual information across views. In the high-level semantic space, adaptive view weights are dynamically assigned based on the distributional affinity between individual views and an initial fused representation, followed by weighted fusion to generate a unified global representation. Additionally, HSACC implicitly recovers missing views by projecting aligned latent representations into high-dimensional semantic spaces and jointly optimizes reconstruction and clustering objectives, enabling cooperative learning of completion and clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that HSACC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five benchmark datasets. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the hierarchical alignment and dynamic weighting mechanisms, while parameter analysis confirms the model's robustness to hyperparameter variations.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) for mathematical reasoning have largely focused on tasks with easily verifiable final answers; however, generating and verifying natural language math proofs remains an open challenge. We identify the absence of a reliable, fine-grained evaluator for LLM-generated math proofs as a critical gap. To address this, we propose a systematic methodology for developing and validating evaluators that assign fine-grained scores on a 0-7 scale to model-generated math proofs. To enable this study, we introduce ProofBench, the first expert-annotated dataset of fine-grained proof ratings, spanning 145 problems from six major math competitions (USAMO, IMO, Putnam, etc) and 435 LLM-generated solutions from Gemini-2.5-pro, o3, and DeepSeek-R1. %with expert gradings. Using ProofBench as a testbed, we systematically explore the evaluator design space across key axes: the backbone model, input context, instructions and evaluation workflow. Our analysis delivers ProofGrader, an evaluator that combines a strong reasoning backbone LM, rich context from reference solutions and marking schemes, and a simple ensembling method; it achieves a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.926 against expert scores, significantly outperforming naive baselines. Finally, we demonstrate its practical utility in a best-of-$n$ selection task: at $n=16$, ProofGrader achieves an average score of 4.14 (out of 7), closing 78% of the gap between a naive binary evaluator (2.48) and the human oracle (4.62), highlighting its potential to advance downstream proof generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced many domains and applications but face high fine-tuning costs, inference latency, limited edge deployability, and reliability concerns. Small language models (SLMs), compact, efficient, and adaptable, offer complementary remedies. Recent work explores collaborative frameworks that fuse SLMs' specialization and efficiency with LLMs' generalization and reasoning to meet diverse objectives across tasks and deployment scenarios. Motivated by these developments, this paper presents a systematic survey of SLM-LLM collaboration organized by collaboration objectives. We propose a taxonomy with four goals: performance enhancement, cost-effectiveness, cloud-edge privacy, and trustworthiness. Within this framework, we review representative methods, summarize design paradigms, and outline open challenges and future directions toward efficient, secure, and scalable SLM-LLM collaboration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception, followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations. Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be available.

Abstract: Jailbreaking techniques pose a significant threat to the safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing defenses typically focus on single-turn attacks, lack coverage across languages, and rely on limited taxonomies that either fail to capture the full diversity of attack strategies or emphasize risk categories rather than the jailbreaking techniques. To advance the understanding of the effectiveness of jailbreaking techniques, we conducted a structured red-teaming challenge. The outcome of our experiments are manifold. First, we developed a comprehensive hierarchical taxonomy of 50 jailbreak strategies, consolidating and extending prior classifications into seven broad families, including impersonation, persuasion, privilege escalation, cognitive overload, obfuscation, goal conflict, and data poisoning. Second, we analyzed the data collected from the challenge to examine the prevalence and success rates of different attack types, providing insights into how specific jailbreak strategies exploit model vulnerabilities and induce misalignment. Third, we benchmark a popular LLM for jailbreak detection, evaluating the benefits of taxonomy-guided prompting for improving automatic detection. Finally, we compiled a new Italian dataset of 1364 multi-turn adversarial dialogues, annotated with our taxonomy, enabling the study of interactions where adversarial intent emerges gradually and succeeds in bypassing traditional safeguards.

Abstract: Cellular image segmentation is essential for quantitative biology yet remains difficult due to heterogeneous modalities, morphological variability, and limited annotations. We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool $\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models. It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust, adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, while reducing annotation burden and matching user preferences.

Abstract: Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women, with HER2 status critically guiding treatment decisions. Noninvasive prediction of HER2 status from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) could streamline diagnostics and reduce reliance on biopsy. However, preprocessing high-dynamic-range DCE-MRI into standardized 8-bit RGB format for pretrained neural networks is nontrivial, and normalization strategy significantly affects model performance. We benchmarked intensity normalization strategies using a Triple-Head Dual-Attention ResNet that processes RGB-fused temporal sequences from three DCE phases. Trained on a multicenter cohort (n=1,149) from the I-SPY trials and externally validated on BreastDCEDL_AMBL (n=43 lesions), our model outperformed transformer-based architectures, achieving 0.75 accuracy and 0.74 AUC on I-SPY test data. N4 bias field correction slightly degraded performance. Without fine-tuning, external validation yielded 0.66 AUC, demonstrating cross-institutional generalizability. These findings highlight the effectiveness of dual-attention mechanisms in capturing transferable spatiotemporal features for HER2 stratification, advancing reproducible deep learning biomarkers in breast cancer imaging.

Abstract: Finetuning on narrow domains has become an essential tool to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks and to create models with known unusual properties that are useful for research. We show that narrow finetuning creates strong biases in LLM activations that can be interpreted to understand the finetuning domain. These biases can be discovered using simple tools from model diffing - the study of differences between models before and after finetuning. In particular, analyzing activation differences on the first few tokens of random text and steering by adding this difference to the model activations produces text similar to the format and general content of the finetuning data. We demonstrate that these analyses contain crucial information by creating an LLM-based interpretability agent to understand the finetuning domain. With access to the bias, the agent performs significantly better compared to baseline agents using simple prompting. Our analysis spans synthetic document finetuning for false facts, emergent misalignment, subliminal learning, and taboo word guessing game models across different architectures (Gemma, LLaMA, Qwen) and scales (1B to 32B parameters). We suspect these biases reflect overfitting and find that mixing pretraining data into the finetuning corpus largely removes them, though residual risks may remain. Our work (1) demonstrates that narrowly finetuned models have salient traces of their training objective in their activations and suggests ways to improve how they are trained, (2) warns AI safety and interpretability researchers that the common practice of using such models as a proxy for studying broader finetuning (e.g., chat-tuning) might not be realistic, and (3) highlights the need for deeper investigation into the effects of narrow finetuning and development of truly realistic case studies for model-diffing, safety and interpretability research.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought prompting has popularized step-by-step reasoning in large language models, yet model performance still degrades as problem complexity and context length grow. By decomposing difficult tasks with long contexts into shorter, manageable ones, recent multi-agent paradigms offer a promising near-term solution to this problem. However, the fundamental capacities of such systems are poorly understood. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze the expressivity of multi-agent systems. We apply our framework to three algorithmic families: state tracking, recall, and $k$-hop reasoning. We derive bounds on (i) the number of agents required to solve the task exactly, (ii) the quantity and structure of inter-agent communication, and (iii) the achievable speedups as problem size and context scale. Our results identify regimes where communication is provably beneficial, delineate tradeoffs between agent count and bandwidth, and expose intrinsic limitations when either resource is constrained. We complement our theoretical analysis with a set of experiments on pretrained LLMs using controlled synthetic benchmarks. Empirical outcomes confirm the tradeoffs between key quantities predicted by our theory. Collectively, our analysis offers principled guidance for designing scalable multi-agent reasoning systems.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enables transformer-based language models to adapt to new tasks by conditioning on demonstration examples. However, traditional example-driven in-context learning lacks explicit modules for knowledge retrieval and transfer at the abstraction level. Inspired by cognitive science, specifically schema theory, which holds that humans interpret new information by activating pre-existing mental frameworks (schemas) to structure understanding, we introduce SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING (SA-ICL). This framework extracts the representation of the building blocks of cognition for the reasoning process instilled from prior examples, creating an abstracted schema, a lightweight, structured template of key inferential steps and their relationships, which is then used to augment a model's reasoning process when presented with a novel question. We demonstrate that a broad range of large language models (LLMs) lack the capacity to form and utilize internal schema-based learning representations implicitly, but instead benefit significantly from explicit schema-based scaffolding. Across chemistry and physics questions from the GPQA dataset, our experiments show that SA-ICL consistently boosts performance, up to 36.19 percent, when the single demonstration example is of high quality, which simultaneously reduces reliance on the number of demonstrations and enhances interpretability. SCHEMA ACTIVATED IN CONTEXT LEARNING not only bridges disparate ICL strategies ranging from pattern priming to Chain-of-Thought prompting, but also paves a new path for enhancing human-like reasoning in LLMs.

<title>Knowledge Reasoning Language Model: Unifying Knowledge and Language for Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Inductive Knowledge Graph Reasoning (KGR) aims to discover facts in open-domain KGs containing unknown entities and relations, which poses a challenge for KGR models in comprehending uncertain KG components. Existing studies have proposed Knowledge Graph Foundation Models (KGFMs) that learn structural invariances across KGs to handle this uncertainty. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities for open-domain knowledge reasoning. As a result, the latest research has focused on LLM-based KGFMs that integrate LLM knowledge with KG context for inductive KGR. However, the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs may be overshadowed by sparse KG context, leading to LLM knowledge distortion, which can cause irreversible damage to model reasoning. Moreover, existing LLM-based KGR methods still struggle to fully constrain generative hallucinations in LLMs, severely limiting the credibility of reasoning results. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Reasoning Language Model (KRLM) that achieves unified coordination between LLM knowledge and KG context throughout the KGR process. Specifically, we design a Knowledge Reasoning Language (KRL) instruction format and a KRL tokenizer to align LLM knowledge with KG representations. Then, we propose a KRL attention layer that coordinates intrinsic LLM knowledge with additional KG context through a dynamic knowledge memory mechanism. Finally, a structure-aware next-entity predictor is proposed, which strictly constrains the reasoning results within a trustworthy knowledge domain. Extensive experimental results on 25 real-world inductive KGR datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed KRLM\footnote{Our source codes are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/KRLM-EA36 in both zero-shot reasoning and fine-tuning scenarios.

<title>AI Debaters are More Persuasive when Arguing in Alignment with Their Own Beliefs</title>

Abstract: The core premise of AI debate as a scalable oversight technique is that it is harder to lie convincingly than to refute a lie, enabling the judge to identify the correct position. Yet, existing debate experiments have relied on datasets with ground truth, where lying is reduced to defending an incorrect proposition. This overlooks a subjective dimension: lying also requires the belief that the claim defended is false. In this work, we apply debate to subjective questions and explicitly measure large language models' prior beliefs before experiments. Debaters were asked to select their preferred position, then presented with a judge persona deliberately designed to conflict with their identified priors. This setup tested whether models would adopt sycophantic strategies, aligning with the judge's presumed perspective to maximize persuasiveness, or remain faithful to their prior beliefs. We implemented and compared two debate protocols, sequential and simultaneous, to evaluate potential systematic biases. Finally, we assessed whether models were more persuasive and produced higher-quality arguments when defending positions consistent with their prior beliefs versus when arguing against them. Our main findings show that models tend to prefer defending stances aligned with the judge persona rather than their prior beliefs, sequential debate introduces significant bias favoring the second debater, models are more persuasive when defending positions aligned with their prior beliefs, and paradoxically, arguments misaligned with prior beliefs are rated as higher quality in pairwise comparison. These results can inform human judges to provide higher-quality training signals and contribute to more aligned AI systems, while revealing important aspects of human-AI interaction regarding persuasion dynamics in language models.

<title>Synthesizing Agentic Data for Web Agents with Progressive Difficulty Enhancement Mechanisms</title>

Abstract: Web-based 'deep research' agents aim to solve complex question - answering tasks through long-horizon interactions with online tools. These tasks remain challenging, as the underlying language models are often not optimized for long-horizon reasoning and exploration. Prior work has proposed workflows for constructing instruction-tuning datasets, often leveraging knowledge graphs. However, such methods typically lack fine-grained control over difficulty and quality, yielding synthetic data that falls short of capturing the complexity required for long-horizon reasoning. Furthermore, many studies conflate data and training effects by comparing models trained under different optimization recipes, making it difficult to isolate and evaluate the effectiveness of the data itself. We introduce a two-pronged data synthesis pipeline that generates question - answer pairs by progressively increasing task complexity until a frontier baseline web agent fails. The baseline agent plays multiple roles in this process: attempting the questions, validating factuality, checking for alternative answers, and enforcing filtering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our synthesis methods, we adopt a controlled training setup based on distillation from strong web agents. Experiments across multiple web-based benchmarks show that our dataset - despite being smaller - enables the training of more effective web agents than existing datasets. In particular, our data exhibits twice the diversity in tool-use actions, allowing models trained on it to achieve stronger performance while avoiding repetitive tool-calling behaviors.

<title>Readability $\ne$ Learnability: Rethinking the Role of Simplicity in Training Small Language Models</title>

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that very small language models (SLMs) can generate surprisingly coherent text when trained on simplified, child-directed corpora such as TinyStories. These findings have been interpreted as evidence that readability -- characterized by accessible vocabulary, familiar narrative structure, and simple syntax -- plays a key role in enabling such capabilities to emerge. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. We construct synthetic datasets with matched structure but varied readability, and find that readability alone does not predict coherence or learning efficiency in SLMs. Models trained on complex, adult-level text perform comparably to those trained on simplified language, and even exhibit faster development of coherence during training. Instead, we show that statistical simplicity, as measured by n-gram diversity, is a stronger predictor of learnability. Our findings caution against the growing trend of anthropomorphizing language model training -- drawing parallels to human cognitive development without empirical basis -- and argue for more precise reasoning about what properties actually support capability emergence in small models.

Abstract: We propose and test the LLM Brain Rot Hypothesis: continual exposure to junk web text induces lasting cognitive decline in large language models (LLMs). To causally isolate data quality, we run controlled experiments on real Twitter/X corpora, constructing junk and reversely controlled datasets via two orthogonal operationalizations: M1 (engagement degree) and M2 (semantic quality), with matched token scale and training operations across conditions. Contrary to the control group, continual pre-training of 4 LLMs on the junk dataset causes non-trivial declines (Hedges' $g>0.3$) on reasoning, long-context understanding, safety, and inflating "dark traits" (e.g., psychopathy, narcissism). The gradual mixtures of junk and control datasets also yield dose-response cognition decay: for example, under M1, ARC-Challenge with Chain Of Thoughts drops $74.9 \rightarrow 57.2$ and RULER-CWE $84.4 \rightarrow 52.3$ as junk ratio rises from $0\%$ to $100\%$.
  Error forensics reveal several key insights. First, we identify thought-skipping as the primary lesion: models increasingly truncate or skip reasoning chains, explaining most of the error growth. Second, partial but incomplete healing is observed: scaling instruction tuning and clean data pre-training improve the declined cognition yet cannot restore baseline capability, suggesting persistent representational drift rather than format mismatch. Finally, we discover that the popularity, a non-semantic metric, of a tweet is a better indicator of the Brain Rot effect than the length in M1. Together, the results provide significant, multi-perspective evidence that data quality is a causal driver of LLM capability decay, reframing curation for continual pretraining as a \textit{training-time safety} problem and motivating routine "cognitive health checks" for deployed LLMs.

<title>Big Reasoning with Small Models: Instruction Retrieval at Inference Time</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Can we bring large-scale reasoning to local-scale compute? Small language models (SLMs) are increasingly attractive because they run efficiently on local hardware, offering strong privacy, low cost, and reduced environmental impact. Yet they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or domain-specific knowledge. We address this limitation through instruction intervention at inference time, where an SLM retrieves structured reasoning procedures rather than generating them from scratch. Our method builds an Instruction Corpus by grouping similar training questions and creating instructions via GPT-5. During inference, the SLM retrieves the most relevant instructions and follows their steps. Unlike retrieval-augmented generation, which retrieves text passages, instruction retrieval gives the model structured guidance for reasoning. We evaluate this framework on MedQA (medical board exams), MMLU Professional Law, and MathQA using models from 3B to 14B parameters without any additional fine-tuning. Instruction retrieval yields consistent gains: 9.4% on MedQA, 7.9% on MMLU Law, and 5.1% on MathQA. Concise instructions outperform longer ones, and the magnitude of improvement depends strongly on model family and intrinsic reasoning ability.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has focused on test-time scaling to improve reasoning via increased inference computation, but often at the cost of efficiency. We revisit test-time behavior and uncover a simple yet underexplored phenomenon: reasoning uncertainty is highly localized-only a small subset of high-entropy tokens dominantly affects output correctness. Motivated by this, we propose Minimal Test-Time Intervention (MTI), a training-free framework that enhances reasoning accuracy and stability with minimal overhead. MTI includes: (i) Selective CFG intervention, applying classifier-free guidance only at uncertain positions; and (ii) Lightweight negative-prompt guidance, reusing the main model's KV cache to approximate unconditional decoding efficiently. MTI yields consistent gains across general, coding, and STEM tasks-e.g., +1.35% average improvement on eight benchmarks for Qwen3-8B-Base and +5% on AIME2024 using Qwen3-32B-Reasoning-while remaining highly efficient.

Abstract: What if artificial agents could not just communicate, but also evolve, adapt, and reshape their worlds in ways we cannot fully predict? With llm now powering multi-agent systems and social simulations, we are witnessing new possibilities for modeling open-ended, ever-changing environments. Yet, most current simulations remain constrained within static sandboxes, characterized by predefined tasks, limited dynamics, and rigid evaluation criteria. These limitations prevent them from capturing the complexity of real-world societies. In this paper, we argue that static, task-specific benchmarks are fundamentally inadequate and must be rethought. We critically review emerging architectures that blend llm with multi-agent dynamics, highlight key hurdles such as balancing stability and diversity, evaluating unexpected behaviors, and scaling to greater complexity, and introduce a fresh taxonomy for this rapidly evolving field. Finally, we present a research roadmap centered on open-endedness, continuous co-evolution, and the development of resilient, socially aligned AI ecosystems. \textbf{We call on the community to move beyond static paradigms and help shape the next generation of adaptive, socially-aware multi-agent simulations.}

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments. Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained. The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.

<title>Finding Holes: Pathologist Level Performance Using AI for Cribriform Morphology Detection in Prostate Cancer</title>

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance. However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430 patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261 slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions for prostate cancer patients.

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression. Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms. Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE (COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only 3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can exhibit biases in reasoning capabilities due to linguistic modality, performing better on tasks in one language versus another, even with similar content. Most previous works evaluate this through reasoning tasks where reliance on strategies or knowledge can ensure success, such as in commonsense or math tasks. However, abstract reasoning is vital to reasoning for everyday life, where people apply "out-of-the-box thinking" to identify and use patterns for solutions, without a reliance on formulaic approaches. Comparatively, little work has evaluated linguistic biases in this task type. In this paper, we propose a task inspired by the New York Times Connections: GlobalGroup, that evaluates models in an abstract reasoning task across several languages. We constructed a game benchmark with five linguistic backgrounds -- English, Spanish, Chinese, Hindi, and Arabic -- in both the native language and an English translation for comparison. We also proposed game difficulty measurements to evaluate models on games with similar difficulty, enabling a more controlled comparison, which is particularly important in reasoning evaluations. Through experimentation, we find English modalities largely lead to better performance in this abstract reasoning task, and performance disparities between open- and closed-source models.

<title>One Bug, Hundreds Behind: LLMs for Large-Scale Bug Discovery</title>

Abstract: Fixing bugs in large programs is a challenging task that demands substantial time and effort. Once a bug is found, it is reported to the project maintainers, who work with the reporter to fix it and eventually close the issue. However, across the program, there are often similar code segments, which may also contain the bug, but were missed during discovery. Finding and fixing each recurring bug instance individually is labor intensive. Even more concerning, bug reports can inadvertently widen the attack surface as they provide attackers with an exploitable pattern that may be unresolved in other parts of the program.
  In this paper, we explore these Recurring Pattern Bugs (RPBs) that appear repeatedly across various code segments of a program or even in different programs, stemming from a same root cause, but are unresolved. Our investigation reveals that RPBs are widespread and can significantly compromise the security of software programs. This paper introduces BugStone, a program analysis system empowered by LLVM and a Large Language Model (LLM). The key observation is that many RPBs have one patched instance, which can be leveraged to identify a consistent error pattern, such as a specific API misuse. By examining the entire program for this pattern, it is possible to identify similar sections of code that may be vulnerable. Starting with 135 unique RPBs, BugStone identified more than 22K new potential issues in the Linux kernel. Manual analysis of 400 of these findings confirmed that 246 were valid. We also created a dataset from over 1.9K security bugs reported by 23 recent top-tier conference works. We manually annotate the dataset, identify 80 recurring patterns and 850 corresponding fixes. Even with a cost-efficient model choice, BugStone achieved 92.2% precision and 79.1% pairwise accuracy on the dataset.

Abstract: Power grids increasingly need real-time situational awareness under the ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape. Advances in snapshot-based system identification approaches have enabled accurately estimating states and topology from a snapshot of measurement data, under random bad data and topology errors. However, modern interactive, targeted false data can stay undetectable to these methods, and significantly compromise estimation accuracy. This work advances system identification that combines snapshot-based method with time-series model via Bayesian Integration, to advance cyber resiliency against both random and targeted false data. Using a distance-based time-series model, this work can leverage historical data of different distributions induced by changes in grid topology and other settings. The normal system behavior captured from historical data is integrated into system identification through a Bayesian treatment, to make solutions robust to targeted false data. We experiment on mixed random anomalies (bad data, topology error) and targeted false data injection attack (FDIA) to demonstrate our method's 1) cyber resilience: achieving over 70% reduction in estimation error under FDIA; 2) anomalous data identification: being able to alarm and locate anomalous data; 3) almost linear scalability: achieving comparable speed with the snapshot-based baseline, both taking <1min per time tick on the large 2,383-bus system using a laptop CPU.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing intraoperative perception and decision-making in telesurgery, where physical separation impairs sensory feedback and control. Despite advances in medical AI and surgical robotics, conventional electronic AI architectures remain fundamentally constrained by the compounded latency from serial processing of inference and communication. This limitation is especially critical in latency-sensitive procedures such as endovascular interventions, where delays over 200 ms can compromise real-time AI reliability and patient safety. Here, we introduce an Optical Computation-in-Communication (OCiC) framework that reduces end-to-end latency significantly by performing AI inference concurrently with optical communication. OCiC integrates Optical Remote Computing Units (ORCUs) directly into the optical communication pathway, with each ORCU experimentally achieving up to 69 tera-operations per second per channel through spectrally efficient two-dimensional photonic convolution. The system maintains ultrahigh inference fidelity within 0.1% of CPU/GPU baselines on classification and coronary angiography segmentation, while intrinsically mitigating cumulative error propagation, a longstanding barrier to deep optical network scalability. We validated the robustness of OCiC through outdoor dark fibre deployments, confirming consistent and stable performance across varying environmental conditions. When scaled globally, OCiC transforms long-haul fibre infrastructure into a distributed photonic AI fabric with exascale potential, enabling reliable, low-latency telesurgery across distances up to 10,000 km and opening a new optical frontier for distributed medical intelligence.

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless, they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification. After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments, we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

<title>DiffOPF: Diffusion Solver for Optimal Power Flow</title>

Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) is a multi-valued, non-convex mapping from loads to dispatch setpoints. The variability of system parameters (e.g., admittances, topology) further contributes to the multiplicity of dispatch setpoints for a given load. Existing deep learning OPF solvers are single-valued and thus fail to capture the variability of system parameters unless fully represented in the feature space, which is prohibitive. To solve this problem, we introduce a diffusion-based OPF solver, termed \textit{DiffOPF}, that treats OPF as a conditional sampling problem. The solver learns the joint distribution of loads and dispatch setpoints from operational history, and returns the marginal dispatch distributions conditioned on loads. Unlike single-valued solvers, DiffOPF enables sampling statistically credible warm starts with favorable cost and constraint satisfaction trade-offs. We explore the sample complexity of DiffOPF to ensure the OPF solution within a prescribed distance from the optimization-based solution, and verify this experimentally on power system benchmarks.

Abstract: The ubiquity of closed-weight language models with public-facing APIs has generated interest in forensic methods, both for extracting hidden model details (e.g., parameters) and for identifying models by their outputs. One successful approach to these goals has been to exploit the geometric constraints imposed by the language model architecture and parameters. In this work, we show that a lesser-known geometric constraint--namely, that language model outputs lie on the surface of a high-dimensional ellipse--functions as a signature for the model and can be used to identify the source model of a given output. This ellipse signature has unique properties that distinguish it from existing model-output association methods like language model fingerprints. In particular, the signature is hard to forge: without direct access to model parameters, it is practically infeasible to produce log-probabilities (logprobs) on the ellipse. Secondly, the signature is naturally occurring, since all language models have these elliptical constraints. Thirdly, the signature is self-contained, in that it is detectable without access to the model inputs or the full weights. Finally, the signature is compact and redundant, as it is independently detectable in each logprob output from the model. We evaluate a novel technique for extracting the ellipse from small models and discuss the practical hurdles that make it infeasible for production-scale models. Finally, we use ellipse signatures to propose a protocol for language model output verification, analogous to cryptographic symmetric-key message authentication systems.

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii) algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively, these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust OOD generalization abilities.

<title>Extracting latent representations from X-ray spectra. Classification, regression, and accretion signatures of Chandra sources</title>

Abstract: The study of X-ray spectra is crucial to understanding the physical nature of astrophysical sources. Machine learning methods can extract compact and informative representations of data from large datasets. The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC) provides a rich archive of X-ray spectral data, which remains largely underexplored in this context. This work aims to develop a compact and physically meaningful representation of Chandra X-ray spectra using deep learning. To verify that the learned representation captures relevant information, we evaluate it through classification, regression, and interpretability analyses. We use a transformer-based autoencoder to compress X-ray spectra. The input spectra, drawn from the CSC, include only high-significance detections. Astrophysical source types and physical summary statistics are compiled from external catalogs. We evaluate the learned representation in terms of spectral reconstruction accuracy, clustering performance on 8 known astrophysical source classes, and correlation with physical quantities such as hardness ratios and hydrogen column density ($N_H$). The autoencoder accurately reconstructs spectra with 8 latent variables. Clustering in the latent space yields a balanced classification accuracy of $\sim$40% across the 8 source classes, increasing to $\sim$69% when restricted to AGNs and stellar-mass compact objects exclusively. Moreover, latent features correlate with non-linear combinations of spectral fluxes, suggesting that the compressed representation encodes physically relevant information. The proposed autoencoder-based pipeline is a powerful tool for the representation and interpretation of X-ray spectra, providing a compact latent space that supports both classification and the estimation of physical properties. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning for spectral studies and uncovering new patterns in X-ray data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming everyday applications, yet deployment in cybersecurity lags due to a lack of high-quality, domain-specific models and training datasets. To address this gap, we present CyberPal 2.0, a family of cybersecurity-expert small language models (SLMs) ranging from 4B-20B parameters. To train CyberPal 2.0, we generate an enriched chain-of-thought cybersecurity instruction dataset built with our data enrichment and formatting pipeline, SecKnowledge 2.0, which integrates expert-in-the-loop steering of reasoning formats alongside LLM-driven multi-step grounding, yielding higher-fidelity, task-grounded reasoning traces for security tasks. Across diverse cybersecurity benchmarks, CyberPal 2.0 consistently outperforms its baselines and matches or surpasses various open and closed-source frontier models, while remaining a fraction of their size. On core cyber threat intelligence knowledge tasks, our models outperform almost all tested frontier models, ranking second only to Sec-Gemini v1. On core threat-investigation tasks, such as correlating vulnerabilities and bug tickets with weaknesses, our best 20B-parameter model outperforms GPT-4o, o1, o3-mini, and Sec-Gemini v1, ranking first, while our smallest 4B-parameter model ranks second.

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development. Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights. Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN, a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong performance holds even with limited training data.

Abstract: We present FinAI Data Assistant, a practical approach for natural-language querying over financial databases that combines large language models (LLMs) with the OpenAI Function Calling API. Rather than synthesizing complete SQL via text-to-SQL, our system routes user requests to a small library of vetted, parameterized queries, trading generative flexibility for reliability, low latency, and cost efficiency. We empirically study three questions: (RQ1) whether LLMs alone can reliably recall or extrapolate time-dependent financial data without external retrieval; (RQ2) how well LLMs map company names to stock ticker symbols; and (RQ3) whether function calling outperforms text-to-SQL for end-to-end database query processing. Across controlled experiments on prices and fundamentals, LLM-only predictions exhibit non-negligible error and show look-ahead bias primarily for stock prices relative to model knowledge cutoffs. Ticker-mapping accuracy is near-perfect for NASDAQ-100 constituents and high for S\&amp;P~500 firms. Finally, FinAI Data Assistant achieves lower latency and cost and higher reliability than a text-to-SQL baseline on our task suite. We discuss design trade-offs, limitations, and avenues for deployment.

<title>Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights</title>

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model. Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed, recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video generation into virtual production.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10% medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8% higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1 in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations facing similar annotation challenges.

Abstract: The emerging large language model role-playing agents (LLM RPAs) aim to simulate individual human behaviors, but the persona fidelity is often undermined by manually-created profiles (e.g., cherry-picked information and personality characteristics) without validating the alignment with the target individuals. To address this limitation, our work introduces the Dynamic Persona Refinement Framework (DPRF).DPRF aims to optimize the alignment of LLM RPAs' behaviors with those of target individuals by iteratively identifying the cognitive divergence, either through free-form or theory-grounded, structured analysis, between generated behaviors and human ground truth, and refining the persona profile to mitigate these divergences.We evaluate DPRF with five LLMs on four diverse behavior-prediction scenarios: formal debates, social media posts with mental health issues, public interviews, and movie reviews.DPRF can consistently improve behavioral alignment considerably over baseline personas and generalizes across models and scenarios.Our work provides a robust methodology for creating high-fidelity persona profiles and enhancing the validity of downstream applications, such as user simulation, social studies, and personalized AI.

Abstract: Multi-stage reasoning has emerged as an effective strategy for enhancing the reasoning capability of small language models by decomposing complex problems into sequential sub-stages. However, this comes at the cost of increased latency. We observe that existing adaptive acceleration techniques, such as layer skipping, struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy in this setting due to two key challenges: (1) stage-wise variation in skip sensitivity, and (2) the generation of redundant output tokens. To address these, we propose LiteStage, a latency-aware layer skipping framework for multi-stage reasoning. LiteStage combines a stage-wise offline search that allocates optimal layer budgets with an online confidence-based generation early exit to suppress unnecessary decoding. Experiments on three benchmarks, e.g., OBQA, CSQA, and StrategyQA, show that LiteStage achieves up to 1.70x speedup with less than 4.0% accuracy loss, outperforming prior training-free layer skipping methods.

Abstract: In large scale recommendation systems like the LinkedIn Feed, the retrieval stage is critical for narrowing hundreds of millions of potential candidates to a manageable subset for ranking. LinkedIn's Feed serves suggested content from outside of the member's network (based on the member's topical interests), where 2000 candidates are retrieved from a pool of hundreds of millions candidate with a latency budget of a few milliseconds and inbound QPS of several thousand per second. This paper presents a novel retrieval approach that fine-tunes a large causal language model (Meta's LLaMA 3) as a dual encoder to generate high quality embeddings for both users (members) and content (items), using only textual input. We describe the end to end pipeline, including prompt design for embedding generation, techniques for fine-tuning at LinkedIn's scale, and infrastructure for low latency, cost effective online serving. We share our findings on how quantizing numerical features in the prompt enables the information to get properly encoded in the embedding, facilitating greater alignment between the retrieval and ranking layer. The system was evaluated using offline metrics and an online A/B test, which showed substantial improvements in member engagement. We observed significant gains among newer members, who often lack strong network connections, indicating that high-quality suggested content aids retention. This work demonstrates how generative language models can be effectively adapted for real time, high throughput retrieval in industrial applications.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present \gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications impose stringent requirements on latency, energy efficiency, and computational resources, particularly in multi-user interactive scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of spatial computing communications (SCC), a framework designed to meet the latency and energy demands of multi-user VR over distributed mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. SCC jointly represents the physical space, defined by users and base stations, and the virtual space, representing shared immersive environments, using a probabilistic model of user dynamics and resource requirements. The resource deployment task is then formulated as a multi-objective combinatorial optimization (MOCO) problem that simultaneously minimizes system latency and energy consumption across distributed MEC resources. To solve this problem, we propose MO-CMPO, a multi-objective consistency model with policy optimization that integrates supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning guided by preference weights. Leveraging a sparse graph neural network (GNN), MO-CMPO efficiently generates Pareto-optimal solutions. Simulations with real-world New Radio base station datasets demonstrate that MO-CMPO achieves superior hypervolume performance and significantly lower inference latency than baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis reveals practical deployment patterns: latency-oriented solutions favor local MEC execution to reduce transmission delay, while energy-oriented solutions minimize redundant placements to save energy.

Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ. We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes (RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics. Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret. To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally, empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate the robustness of DR-RPO.

Abstract: Understanding and modeling the relationship between language and sound is critical for applications such as music information retrieval,text-guided music generation, and audio captioning. Central to these tasks is the use of joint language-audio embedding spaces, which map textual descriptions and auditory content into a shared embedding space. While multimodal embedding models such as MS-CLAP, LAION-CLAP, and MuQ-MuLan have shown strong performance in aligning language and audio, their correspondence to human perception of timbre, a multifaceted attribute encompassing qualities such as brightness, roughness, and warmth, remains underexplored. In this paper, we evaluate the above three joint language-audio embedding models on their ability to capture perceptual dimensions of timbre. Our findings show that LAION-CLAP consistently provides the most reliable alignment with human-perceived timbre semantics across both instrumental sounds and audio effects.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives. Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

<title>Less is More: Denoising Knowledge Graphs For Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable large language models (LLMs) instant access to relevant information for the generative process, demonstrating their superior performance in addressing common LLM challenges such as hallucination, factual inaccuracy, and the knowledge cutoff. Graph-based RAG further extends this paradigm by incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs) to leverage rich, structured connections for more precise and inferential responses. A critical challenge, however, is that most Graph-based RAG systems rely on LLMs for automated KG construction, often yielding noisy KGs with redundant entities and unreliable relationships. This noise degrades retrieval and generation performance while also increasing computational cost. Crucially, current research does not comprehensively address the denoising problem for LLM-generated KGs. In this paper, we introduce DEnoised knowledge Graphs for Retrieval Augmented Generation (DEG-RAG), a framework that addresses these challenges through: (1) entity resolution, which eliminates redundant entities, and (2) triple reflection, which removes erroneous relations. Together, these techniques yield more compact, higher-quality KGs that significantly outperform their unprocessed counterparts. Beyond the methods, we conduct a systematic evaluation of entity resolution for LLM-generated KGs, examining different blocking strategies, embedding choices, similarity metrics, and entity merging techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive exploration of entity resolution in LLM-generated KGs. Our experiments demonstrate that this straightforward approach not only drastically reduces graph size but also consistently improves question answering performance across diverse popular Graph-based RAG variants.

<title>PRISM: Agentic Retrieval with LLMs for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Retrieval plays a central role in multi-hop question answering (QA), where answering complex questions requires gathering multiple pieces of evidence. We introduce an Agentic Retrieval System that leverages large language models (LLMs) in a structured loop to retrieve relevant evidence with high precision and recall. Our framework consists of three specialized agents: a Question Analyzer that decomposes a multi-hop question into sub-questions, a Selector that identifies the most relevant context for each sub-question (focusing on precision), and an Adder that brings in any missing evidence (focusing on recall). The iterative interaction between Selector and Adder yields a compact yet comprehensive set of supporting passages. In particular, it achieves higher retrieval accuracy while filtering out distracting content, enabling downstream QA models to surpass full-context answer accuracy while relying on significantly less irrelevant information. Experiments on four multi-hop QA benchmarks -- HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and MultiHopRAG -- demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Website Fingerprinting (WF) attacks exploit patterns in encrypted traffic to infer the websites visited by users, posing a serious threat to anonymous communication systems. Although recent WF techniques achieve over 90% accuracy in controlled experimental settings, most studies remain confined to single scenarios, overlooking the complexity of real-world environments. This paper presents the first systematic and comprehensive evaluation of existing WF attacks under diverse realistic conditions, including defense mechanisms, traffic drift, multi-tab browsing, early-stage detection, open-world settings, and few-shot scenarios. Experimental results show that many WF techniques with strong performance in isolated settings degrade significantly when facing other conditions. Since real-world environments often combine multiple challenges, current WF attacks are difficult to apply directly in practice. This study highlights the limitations of WF attacks and introduces a multidimensional evaluation framework, offering critical insights for developing more robust and practical WF attacks.

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability. Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns (straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23 participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.

<title>TED++: Submanifold-Aware Backdoor Detection via Layerwise Tubular-Neighbourhood Screening</title>

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++, a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness'' from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking (LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to 14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/namle-w/TEDpp.

<title>Expertise need not monopolize: Action-Specialized Mixture of Experts for Vision-Language-Action Learning</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However, scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1) select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2) identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE, MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded responses.

Abstract: Column generation and branch-and-price are leading methods for large-scale exact optimization. Column generation iterates between solving a master problem and a pricing problem. The master problem is a linear program, which can be solved using a generic solver. The pricing problem is highly dependent on the application but is usually discrete. Due to the difficulty of discrete optimization, high-performance column generation often relies on a custom pricing algorithm built specifically to exploit the problem's structure. This bespoke nature of the pricing solver prevents the reuse of components for other applications. We show that domain-independent dynamic programming, a software package for modeling and solving arbitrary dynamic programs, can be used as a generic pricing solver. We develop basic implementations of branch-and-price with pricing by domain-independent dynamic programming and show that they outperform a world-leading solver on static mixed integer programming formulations for seven problem classes.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with millions of people worldwide in applications such as customer support, education and healthcare. However, their ability to produce deceptive outputs, whether intentionally or inadvertently, poses significant safety concerns. The unpredictable nature of LLM behavior, combined with insufficient safeguards against hallucination, misinformation, and user manipulation, makes their misuse a serious, real-world risk. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which LLMs engage in deception within dialogue, and propose the belief misalignment metric to quantify deception. We evaluate deception across four distinct dialogue scenarios, using five established deception detection metrics and our proposed metric. Our findings reveal this novel deception measure correlates more closely with human judgments than any existing metrics we test. Additionally, our benchmarking of eight state-of-the-art models indicates that LLMs naturally exhibit deceptive behavior in approximately 26% of dialogue turns, even when prompted with seemingly benign objectives. When prompted to deceive, LLMs are capable of increasing deceptiveness by as much as 31% relative to baselines. Unexpectedly, models trained with RLHF, the predominant approach for ensuring the safety of widely-deployed LLMs, still exhibit deception at a rate of 43% on average. Given that deception in dialogue is a behavior that develops over an interaction history, its effective evaluation and mitigation necessitates moving beyond single-utterance analyses. We introduce a multi-turn reinforcement learning methodology to fine-tune LLMs to reduce deceptive behaviors, leading to a 77.6% reduction compared to other instruction-tuned models.

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is greatly beneficial to AD patients, leading to early treatments that lessen symptoms and alleviating financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, language capability changes can be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I develop a robust classification method using hybrid word embedding and fine-tuned hyperparameters to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in the early detection of AD. Specifically, we create a hybrid word embedding based on word vectors from Doc2Vec and ELMo to obtain perplexity scores of the sentences. The scores identify whether a sentence is fluent or not and capture semantic context of the sentences. I enrich the word embedding by adding linguistic features to analyze syntax and semantics. Further, we input an embedded feature vector into logistic regression and fine tune hyperparameters throughout the pipeline. By tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g., model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2Vec, and vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 97% in distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Based on my knowledge, my model with 91% accuracy and 97% AUC outperforms the best existing NLP model for AD diagnosis with an accuracy of 88% [32]. I study the model stability through repeated experiments and find that the model is stable even though the training data is split randomly (standard deviation of accuracy = 0.0403; standard deviation of AUC = 0.0174). This affirms our proposed method is accurate and stable. This model can be used as a large-scale screening method for AD, as well as a complementary examination for doctors to detect AD.

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories, Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of 324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI (sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity 92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%), whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both (92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both high-resource and resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Mobile app markets host millions of apps, yet undesired behaviors (e.g., disruptive ads, illegal redirection, payment deception) remain hard to catch because they often do not rely on permission-protected APIs and can be easily camouflaged via UI or metadata edits. We present BINCTX, a learning approach that builds multi-modal representations of an app from (i) a global bytecode-as-image view that captures code-level semantics and family-style patterns, (ii) a contextual view (manifested actions, components, declared permissions, URL/IP constants) indicating how behaviors are triggered, and (iii) a third-party-library usage view summarizing invocation frequencies along inter-component call paths. The three views are embedded and fused to train a contextual-aware classifier. On real-world malware and benign apps, BINCTX attains a macro F1 of 94.73%, outperforming strong baselines by at least 14.92%. It remains robust under commercial obfuscation (F1 84% post-obfuscation) and is more resistant to adversarial samples than state-of-the-art bytecode-only systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as role-playing agents, yet their capacity to faithfully and consistently portray version-specific characters -- for example, superheroes across comic and cinematic universes -- remains underexplored. Superhero canons such as Marvel and DC provide a rich testbed: decades of storytelling yield multiple incarnations of the same character with distinct histories, values, and moral codes. To study this problem, we introduce Beyond One World, a benchmark for character-grounded roleplay spanning 30 iconic heroes and 90 canon-specific versions. The benchmark comprises two tasks: (i) Canon Events, which probes factual recall of pivotal life stages, and (ii) Moral Dilemmas, which confronts models with ethically charged scenarios. We score responses for canonical accuracy and reasoning fidelity under a framework that separates internal deliberation ("thinking") from outward decisions ("acting"). We further propose Think-Act Matching, a metric that quantifies alignment between reasons and actions and serves as a proxy for model trustworthiness. Experiments across reasoning- and non-reasoning-oriented models yield three findings: (1) chain-of-thought prompting improves narrative coherence in weaker models but can reduce canonical accuracy in stronger ones; (2) cross-version generalization within a character remains a major obstacle; and (3) models often excel at either thinking or acting, but rarely both. Beyond One World exposes critical gaps in multiversal consistency and reasoning alignment, offering a challenging evaluation for role-playing LLMs.

Abstract: High-performing medical Large Language Models (LLMs) typically require extensive fine-tuning with substantial computational resources, limiting accessibility for resource-constrained healthcare institutions. This study introduces a confidence-driven multi-model framework that leverages model diversity to enhance medical question answering without fine-tuning. Our framework employs a two-stage architecture: a confidence detection module assesses the primary model's certainty, and an adaptive routing mechanism directs low-confidence queries to Helper models with complementary knowledge for collaborative reasoning. We evaluate our approach using Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct, Phi-4 14B, and Gemma 2 12B across three medical benchmarks; MedQA, MedMCQA, and PubMedQA. Result demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance, with particularly strong results in PubMedQA (95.0\%) and MedMCQA (78.0\%). Ablation studies confirm that confidence-aware routing combined with multi-model collaboration substantially outperforms single-model approaches and uniform reasoning strategies. This work establishes that strategic model collaboration offers a practical, computationally efficient pathway to improve medical AI systems, with significant implications for democratizing access to advanced medical AI in resource-limited settings.

Abstract: Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation (SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47 to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m, demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Abstract: To advance a Weather-Ready Nation, the National Weather Service (NWS) is developing a systematic translation program to better serve the 68.8 million people in the U.S. who do not speak English at home. This article outlines the foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national warning system that reaches all Americans.

<title>Are My Optimized Prompts Compromised? Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks.

Abstract: Recent beat and downbeat tracking models (e.g., RNNs, TCNs, Transformers) output frame-level activations. We propose reframing this task as object detection, where beats and downbeats are modeled as temporal "objects." Adapting the FCOS detector from computer vision to 1D audio, we replace its original backbone with WaveBeat's temporal feature extractor and add a Feature Pyramid Network to capture multi-scale temporal patterns. The model predicts overlapping beat/downbeat intervals with confidence scores, followed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) to select final predictions. This NMS step serves a similar role to DBNs in traditional trackers, but is simpler and less heuristic. Evaluated on standard music datasets, our approach achieves competitive results, showing that object detection techniques can effectively model musical beats with minimal adaptation.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) inference systems face a fundamental tension between minimizing Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) latency for new requests and maintaining a high, steady token generation rate (low Time-Per-Output-Token, or TPOT) for ongoing requests. Existing stall-free batching schedulers proposed by Sarathi, while effective at preventing decode stalls, introduce significant computational unfairness. They prioritize decode tasks excessively, simultaneously leading to underutilized decode slack and unnecessary prefill queuing delays, which collectively degrade the system's overall quality of service (QoS).
  This work identifies the root cause of this unfairness: the non-monotonic nature of Time-Between-Tokens (TBT) as a scheduling metric and the rigid decode-prioritizing policy that fails to adapt to dynamic workload bursts. We therefore propose FairBatching, a novel LLM inference scheduler that enforces fair resource allocation between prefill and decode tasks. It features an adaptive batch capacity determination mechanism, which dynamically adjusts the computational budget to improve the GPU utilization without triggering SLO violations. Its fair and dynamic batch formation algorithm breaks away from the decode-prioritizing paradigm, allowing computation resources to be reclaimed from bursting decode tasks to serve prefill surges, achieving global fairness. Furthermore, FairBatching provides a novel load estimation method, enabling more effective coordination with upper-level schedulers. Implemented and evaluated on realistic traces, FairBatching significantly reduces TTFT tail latency by up to 2.29x while robustly maintaining TPOT SLOs, achieving overall 20.0% improvement in single-node capacity and 54.3% improvement in cluster-level capacity.

Abstract: Biomedical question answering (QA) requires accurate interpretation of complex medical knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in this domain, with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhancing performance by incorporating external medical literature. However, RAG-based approaches in biomedical QA suffer from hallucinations due to post-retrieval noise and insufficient verification of retrieved evidence, undermining response reliability. We propose MedTrust-Guided Iterative RAG, a framework designed to enhance factual consistency and mitigate hallucinations in medical QA. Our method introduces three key innovations. First, it enforces citation-aware reasoning by requiring all generated content to be explicitly grounded in retrieved medical documents, with structured Negative Knowledge Assertions used when evidence is insufficient. Second, it employs an iterative retrieval-verification process, where a verification agent assesses evidence adequacy and refines queries through Medical Gap Analysis until reliable information is obtained. Third, it integrates the MedTrust-Align Module (MTAM) that combines verified positive examples with hallucination-aware negative samples, leveraging Direct Preference Optimization to reinforce citation-grounded reasoning while penalizing hallucination-prone response patterns. Experiments on MedMCQA, MedQA, and MMLU-Med demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baselines across multiple model architectures, achieving the best average accuracy with gains of 2.7% for LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct and 2.4% for Qwen3-8B.

<title>The Role of Social Learning and Collective Norm Formation in Fostering Cooperation in LLM Multi-Agent Systems</title>

Abstract: A growing body of multi-agent studies with Large Language Models (LLMs) explores how norms and cooperation emerge in mixed-motive scenarios, where pursuing individual gain can undermine the collective good. While prior work has explored these dynamics in both richly contextualized simulations and simplified game-theoretic environments, most LLM systems featuring common-pool resource (CPR) games provide agents with explicit reward functions directly tied to their actions. In contrast, human cooperation often emerges without full visibility into payoffs and population, relying instead on heuristics, communication, and punishment. We introduce a CPR simulation framework that removes explicit reward signals and embeds cultural-evolutionary mechanisms: social learning (adopting strategies and beliefs from successful peers) and norm-based punishment, grounded in Ostrom's principles of resource governance. Agents also individually learn from the consequences of harvesting, monitoring, and punishing via environmental feedback, enabling norms to emerge endogenously. We establish the validity of our simulation by reproducing key findings from existing studies on human behavior. Building on this, we examine norm evolution across a $2\times2$ grid of environmental and social initialisations (resource-rich vs. resource-scarce; altruistic vs. selfish) and benchmark how agentic societies comprised of different LLMs perform under these conditions. Our results reveal systematic model differences in sustaining cooperation and norm formation, positioning the framework as a rigorous testbed for studying emergent norms in mixed-motive LLM societies. Such analysis can inform the design of AI systems deployed in social and organizational contexts, where alignment with cooperative norms is critical for stability, fairness, and effective governance of AI-mediated environments.

Abstract: Language models often struggle to follow multi-constraint instructions that are crucial for real-world applications. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches suffer from dependency on external supervision and sparse reward signals from multi-constraint tasks. We propose a label-free self-supervised RL framework that eliminates dependency on external supervision by deriving reward signals directly from instructions and generating pseudo-labels for reward model training. Our approach introduces constraint decomposition strategies and efficient constraint-wise binary classification to address sparse reward challenges while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that our approach generalizes well, achieving strong improvements across 3 in-domain and 5 out-of-domain datasets, including challenging agentic and multi-turn instruction following.

Abstract: The convergence of IoT sensing, edge computing, and machine learning is transforming precision livestock farming. Yet bioacoustic data streams remain underused because of computational complexity and ecological validity challenges. We present one of the most comprehensive bovine vocalization datasets to date, with 569 curated clips covering 48 behavioral classes, recorded across three commercial dairy farms using multiple microphone arrays and expanded to 2900 samples through domain informed augmentation. This FAIR compliant resource addresses major Big Data challenges - volume (90 hours of recordings, 65.6 GB), variety (multi farm and multi zone acoustics), velocity (real time processing), and veracity (noise robust feature extraction). Our distributed processing framework integrates advanced denoising using iZotope RX, multimodal synchronization through audio and video alignment, and standardized feature engineering with 24 acoustic descriptors generated from Praat, librosa, and openSMILE. Preliminary benchmarks reveal distinct class level acoustic patterns for estrus detection, distress classification, and maternal communication. The datasets ecological realism, reflecting authentic barn acoustics rather than controlled settings, ensures readiness for field deployment. This work establishes a foundation for animal centered AI, where bioacoustic data enable continuous and non invasive welfare assessment at industrial scale. By releasing standardized pipelines and detailed metadata, we promote reproducible research that connects Big Data analytics, sustainable agriculture, and precision livestock management. The framework supports UN SDG 9, showing how data science can turn traditional farming into intelligent, welfare optimized systems that meet global food needs while upholding ethical animal care.

<title>A Free Lunch in LLM Compression: Revisiting Retraining after Pruning</title>

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs. Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work, we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides 24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1 regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to adapt demonstrated motions to diverse real-world conditions while accurately preserving motion patterns. Existing motion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often sacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate imitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to adapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single reference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our method first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference motion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical assumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to generate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment, enabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and adaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in both simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks across a wide range of adaptation conditions.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded, resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates, highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) rapidly advance, performance on high-resource languages (e.g., English, Chinese) is nearing saturation, yet remains substantially lower for low-resource languages (e.g., Urdu, Thai) due to limited training data, machine-translation noise, and unstable cross-lingual alignment. We introduce LiRA (Linguistic Robust Anchoring for Large Language Models), a training framework that robustly improves cross-lingual representations under low-resource conditions while jointly strengthening retrieval and reasoning. LiRA comprises two modules: (i) Arca (Anchored Representation Composition Architecture), which anchors low-resource languages to an English semantic space via anchor-based alignment and multi-agent collaborative encoding, preserving geometric stability in a shared embedding space; and (ii) LaSR (Language-coupled Semantic Reasoner), which adds a language-aware lightweight reasoning head with consistency regularization on top of Arca's multilingual representations, unifying the training objective to enhance cross-lingual understanding, retrieval, and reasoning robustness. We further construct and release a multilingual product retrieval dataset covering five Southeast Asian and two South Asian languages. Experiments across low-resource benchmarks (cross-lingual retrieval, semantic similarity, and reasoning) show consistent gains and robustness under few-shot and noise-amplified settings; ablations validate the contribution of both Arca and LaSR. Code will be released on GitHub and the dataset on Hugging Face.

Abstract: The emergence of graph foundation models (GFMs), particularly those incorporating language models (LMs), has revolutionized graph learning and demonstrated remarkable performance on text-attributed graphs (TAGs). However, compared to traditional GNNs, these LM-empowered GFMs introduce unique security vulnerabilities during the unsecured prompt tuning phase that remain understudied in current research. Through empirical investigation, we reveal a significant performance degradation in traditional graph backdoor attacks when operating in attribute-inaccessible constrained TAG systems without explicit trigger node attribute optimization. To address this, we propose a novel dual-trigger backdoor attack framework that operates at both text-level and struct-level, enabling effective attacks without explicit optimization of trigger node text attributes through the strategic utilization of a pre-established text pool. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our attack maintains superior clean accuracy while achieving outstanding attack success rates, including scenarios with highly concealed single-trigger nodes. Our work highlights critical backdoor risks in web-deployed LM-empowered GFMs and contributes to the development of more robust supervision mechanisms for open-source platforms in the era of foundation models.

Abstract: Brains learn to represent information from a large set of stimuli, typically by weak supervision. Unsupervised learning is therefore a natural approach for exploring the design of biological neural networks and their computations. Accordingly, redundancy reduction has been suggested as a prominent design principle of neural encoding, but its ``mechanistic'' biological implementation is unclear. Analogously, unsupervised training of artificial neural networks yields internal representations that allow for accurate stimulus classification or decoding, but typically rely on biologically-implausible implementations. We suggest that interactions between parallel subnetworks in the brain may underlie such learning: we present a model of representation learning by ensembles of neural networks, where each network learns to encode stimuli into an abstract representation space by cross-supervising interactions with other networks, for inputs they receive simultaneously or in close temporal proximity. Aiming for biological plausibility, each network has a small ``receptive field'', thus receiving a fixed part of the external input, and the networks do not share weights. We find that for different types of network architectures, and for both visual or neuronal stimuli, these cross-supervising networks learn semantic representations that are easily decodable and that decoding accuracy is comparable to supervised networks -- both at the level of single networks and the ensemble. We further show that performance is optimal for small receptive fields, and that sparse connectivity between networks is nearly as accurate as all-to-all interactions, with far fewer computations. We thus suggest a sparsely interacting collective of cross-supervising networks as an algorithmic framework for representational learning and collective computation in the brain.

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use. We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random." Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

Abstract: When working on digital devices, people often face distractions that can lead to a decline in productivity and efficiency, as well as negative psychological and emotional impacts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant that elicits a user's intention, assesses whether ongoing activities are in line with that intention, and provides gentle nudges when deviations occur. The system leverages a large language model to analyze screenshots, application titles, and URLs, issuing notifications when behavior diverges from the stated goal. Its detection accuracy is refined through initial clarification dialogues and continuous user feedback. In a three-week, within-subjects field deployment with 22 participants, we compared our assistant to both a rule-based intent reminder system and a passive baseline that only logged activity. Results indicate that our AI assistant effectively supports users in maintaining focus and aligning their digital behavior with their intentions.

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image, making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection, addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable, cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards, paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues; and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14 challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating scalable web agent training.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder. However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate (FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

<title>Local Causal Discovery for Statistically Efficient Causal Inference</title>

Abstract: Causal discovery methods can identify valid adjustment sets for causal effect estimation for a pair of target variables, even when the underlying causal graph is unknown. Global causal discovery methods focus on learning the whole causal graph and therefore enable the recovery of optimal adjustment sets, i.e., sets with the lowest asymptotic variance, but they quickly become computationally prohibitive as the number of variables grows. Local causal discovery methods offer a more scalable alternative by focusing on the local neighborhood of the target variables, but are restricted to statistically suboptimal adjustment sets. In this work, we propose Local Optimal Adjustments Discovery (LOAD), a sound and complete causal discovery approach that combines the computational efficiency of local methods with the statistical optimality of global methods. First, LOAD identifies the causal relation between the targets and tests if the causal effect is identifiable by using only local information. If it is identifiable, it then finds the optimal adjustment set by leveraging local causal discovery to infer the mediators and their parents. Otherwise, it returns the locally valid parent adjustment sets based on the learned local structure. In our experiments on synthetic and realistic data LOAD outperforms global methods in scalability, while providing more accurate effect estimation than local methods.

<title>STANCE: Motion Coherent Video Generation Via Sparse-to-Dense Anchored Encoding</title>

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps) often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance; and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse, user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB \(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Abstract: Large language models promise a broad set of functions, but when not given a specific objective, they default to milquetoast results such as drafting emails littered with cliches. We demonstrate that inferring the user's in-the-moment objective, then rapidly optimizing for that singular objective, enables LLMs to produce tools, interfaces, and responses that are more responsive and desired. We contribute an architecture for automatically inducing just-in-time objectives by passively observing user behavior, then steering downstream AI systems through generation and evaluation against this objective. Inducing just-in-time objectives (e.g., "Clarify the abstract's research contribution") enables automatic generation of tools, e.g., those that critique a draft based on relevant HCI methodologies, anticipate related researchers' reactions, or surface ambiguous terminology. In a series of experiments (N=14, N=205) on participants' own tasks, JIT objectives enable LLM outputs that achieve 66-86% win rates over typical LLMs, and in-person use sessions (N=17) confirm that JIT objectives produce specialized tools unique to each participant.

<title>Knowledge-based Visual Question Answer with Multimodal Processing, Retrieval and Filtering</title>

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We explore the use of Active Inference (AIF) as a computational user model for spatial pointing, a key problem in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). We present an AIF agent with continuous state, action, and observation spaces, performing one-dimensional mouse pointing and clicking. We use a simple underlying dynamic system to model the mouse cursor dynamics with realistic perceptual delay. In contrast to previous optimal feedback control-based models, the agent's actions are selected by minimizing Expected Free Energy, solely based on preference distributions over percepts, such as observing clicking a button correctly. Our results show that the agent creates plausible pointing movements and clicks when the cursor is over the target, with similar end-point variance to human users. In contrast to other models of pointing, we incorporate fully probabilistic, predictive delay compensation into the agent. The agent shows distinct behaviour for differing target difficulties without the need to retune system parameters, as done in other approaches. We discuss the simulation results and emphasize the challenges in identifying the correct configuration of an AIF agent interacting with continuous systems.

Abstract: Current preference learning methods achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks but exhibit significant performance degradation when objective quality signals are removed. We introduce WritingPreferenceBench, a dataset of 1,800 human-annotated preference pairs (1,200 English, 600 Chinese) across 8 creative writing genres, where responses are matched for objective correctness, factual accuracy, and length. On this benchmark, sequence-based reward models--the standard architecture for RLHF--achieve only 52.7% mean accuracy, while zero-shot language model judges perform at 53.9%. In contrast, generative reward models that produce explicit reasoning chains achieve 81.8% accuracy. We observe high within-model variance across genres: individual models range from 18.2% to 81.8% accuracy across different writing categories, with standard deviations averaging 10.1%. This variance persists regardless of model scale, with 27B parameter models showing no consistent improvement over 8B variants. Our results suggest that current RLHF methods primarily learn to detect objective errors rather than capture subjective quality preferences (e.g., creativity, stylistic flair, and emotional resonance), and that successful preference modeling may require intermediate reasoning representations rather than direct classification.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks. Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections, thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking. Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation, enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures. Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability.

Abstract: Multi-interest recommendation has gained attention, especially in industrial retrieval stage. Unlike classical dual-tower methods, it generates multiple user representations instead of a single one to model comprehensive user interests. However, prior studies have identified two underlying limitations: the first is interest collapse, where multiple representations homogenize. The second is insufficient modeling of interest evolution, as they struggle to capture latent interests absent from a user's historical behavior. We begin with a thorough review of existing works in tackling these limitations. Then, we attempt to tackle these limitations from a new perspective. Specifically, we propose a framework-level refinement for multi-interest recommendation, named GemiRec. The proposed framework leverages interest quantization to enforce a structural interest separation and interest generation to learn the evolving dynamics of user interests explicitly. It comprises three modules: (a) Interest Dictionary Maintenance Module (IDMM) maintains a shared quantized interest dictionary. (b) Multi-Interest Posterior Distribution Module (MIPDM) employs a generative model to capture the distribution of user future interests. (c) Multi-Interest Retrieval Module (MIRM) retrieves items using multiple user-interest representations. Both theoretical and empirical analyses, as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate its advantages and effectiveness. Moreover, it has been deployed in production since March 2025, showing its practical value in industrial applications.

Abstract: Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization. Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation forms a crucial component in recommendation systems. It leverages auxiliary information through source domain tasks or features to enhance target domain recommendations. However, incorporating inconsistent source domain tasks may result in insufficient cross-domain modeling or negative transfer. While incorporating source domain features without considering the underlying causal relationships may limit their contribution to final predictions. Thus, a natural idea is to directly train a cross-domain representation on a causality-labeled dataset from the source to target domain. Yet this direction has been rarely explored, as identifying unbiased real causal labels is highly challenging in real-world scenarios. In this work, we attempt to take a first step in this direction by proposing a causality-enhanced framework, named CE-CDR. Specifically, we first reformulate the cross-domain recommendation as a causal graph for principled guidance. We then construct a causality-aware dataset heuristically. Subsequently, we derive a theoretically unbiased Partial Label Causal Loss to generalize beyond the biased causality-aware dataset to unseen cross-domain patterns, yielding an enriched cross-domain representation, which is then fed into the target model to enhance target-domain recommendations. Theoretical and empirical analyses, as well as extensive experiments, demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of CE-CDR and its general applicability as a model-agnostic plugin. Moreover, it has been deployed in production since April 2025, showing its practical value in real-world applications.

Abstract: In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants and protocol designers alike.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality. Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

Abstract: Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters. Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast, generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.
